"Pervasive Computing: Implications, Opportunities and Challenges for the Society","Venkataramana, Y.","Reddy West Virginia Univ., Morgantown, WV","Pervasive Computing and Applications, 2006 1st International Symposium on","20070129","2006","","","5","5","Summary form only given. Pervasive computing, also referred to sometimes as ubiquitous computing deals with the idea of making ""computing power"" available anyplace, anytime in a uniform way so that it may be exploited for meeting the challenges faced by society. The obvious analogy to this is the electric power infrastructures, which made the society's work and play more effective and enjoyable. Can pervasive computing also have a similar or greater impact on society? The answer is undoubtedly a resounding yes. However, we have a long way to go and overcome many a challenge. In this talk, we discuss these issues: the implications, opportunities and challenges pervasive computing. There have been steady advances in the area of computing hardware contributing to the dramatic affordability of computers. The revolution brought about by the Internet and the liberalization of the communications industry has brought the world closer. Now, it is no longer possible to even define what device may be termed a computer as ""computing"" becomes embedded in everyday appliances large and small ranging from cars to washing machines. The merger of computing and communications together with miniaturization is leading the way. However, for the promise of pervasive computing to frilly materialize, technology and support structures need to advance along four directions: computing, communication, cognition, and collaboration - the 4Cs of pervasive computing. Among the 4Cs the first two: computing and communications are rapidly advancing especially with the introduction of GPS as an embedded service. For a user to truly benefit from pervasive computing, the first two Cs are not enough. The supporting systems need to exhibit cognition - an understanding of the situation or ""context awareness"" as it is often called. For over fifty years the field of artificial intelligence has contributed many ideas (expert systems, planning, and natural language understanding - to name a few). The ideas of- agent based computing and service based architectures are making contributions in this regard. The field of CSCW (computer supported collaborative work) and related research are contributing to the fourth C as it tries to make the world small by enabling people worldwide to work together - albeit with the great inconvenience of dealing with myriad disparate tools, technologies and standards. It is not difficult to speculate how the world of tomorrow will be as we make steady progress on the 4Cs and the resulting advances in pervasive computing. A few are listed below: knowledge workers - a universal knowledge based assistant that helps you to work seamlessly in your local space or shared space exploiting the ambient computing and connectivity; intelligent transportation - a car that avoids accidents, repairs itself and adapts itself to the geographic location and services that are accessible; pervasive healthcare - physicians who can diagnose and treat (reprogramming a device!) patients anywhere and anytime; context-aware appliances - washing machines that know the requirements of clothes that are about to be washed; and enterprises - routine formation of collaborative enterprises worldwide. These are but a few of the exciting things that await us as we come to terms with pervasive computing. However, we need to be cognizant about the many challenges such as loss of privacy and freedoms that are cherished by the societies","","1-4244-0325-1","","10.1109/SPCA.2006.297455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079026","","Cognition;Collaboration;Communication industry;Embedded computing;Hardware;Home appliances;Internet;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing;Washing machines","social aspects of automation;ubiquitous computing","Internet;cognition;computer supported collaborative work;computing hardware;computing power;context awareness;embedded service;pervasive computing;ubiquitous computing","","7","","","","","3-5 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. Tasks may be small or large, uniprocessor or multiprocessor, compute-intensive or data-intensive.

The ultimate goal of ubiquitous computing is to provide users with the way of computing anytime and anywhere. A necessary condition and/or fundamental assumption to underlie ubiquitous computing are that there certainly are computing systems working anytime available anywhere throughout the physical world. Therefore, ubiquitous computing must lead to requiring that computing systems can run continuously and persistently without stopping. However, all the existing testing and debugging techniques take programs of a system rather than the running system itself as the objects and/or targets, and assume that any program can be executed repeatedly with various input data only for testing and debugging without regard to stopping the task that program has to perform. In order to develop, use, and maintain persistent computing systems, we have to find a completely new methodology and its related techniques to test and debug a persistent computing system at run-time without stopping it.

Grid computing is increasingly being viewed as the next phase of distributed computing. Built on pervasive Internet standards, grid computing enables organizations to share computing and information resources across department and organizational boundaries in a secure, highly efficient manner. Grid computing originates in eScience and its early development was driven to a large extent by the requirements of large-scale computing and efficient sharing of huge datasets. eBusiness requirements led to the adoption of emerging Web services technologies - initially developed for distributed business application integration. Therefore grid computing can be applied to enterprise computing within and across organizations and pave the way for utility computing.

Eighth International Conference on","20060227","2005","","","6 pp.","558","Computational grids provide an emerging highly distributed computing platform for scientific computing. Recently, service oriented architecture (SOA) has become a trend of implementing software systems including grids. SOA provides more flexibilities for grid users at the service level. High performance computing (HPC) facilities such as HPC clusters, as building blocks of grid computing, are playing an important role in computational Grid and they are embracing SOA when integrated into grid in the format of services. Currently, how to build flexible and easy-to-use HPC service for grid computing still remains an open topic and not much work has been done in this area. In this paper, we propose an HPC cluster service architecture for Grid computing and utility computing. It provides the basic function such as service deployment, service monitoring, and service execution, etc. HPC cluster service deployment not only includes normal application deployment, but also operating system (currently Open Solaris) deployment on demand. Based on Solaris Jumpstart technology and some related tools, a prototype of this architecture has been developed and running on HPC clusters. With our prototype, the grid users are able to deploy a basic HPC environment (e.g., OpenSolaris, MPICH, Sun Grid Engine or N1 Grid Engine resource management tool) among the available cluster nodes. Our experiments show that our work provide great convenience and flexibility for users to setup and customize their preferred HPC cluster environment for their computation intensive applications in grid computing or utility computing","","0-7695-2486-9","","10.1109/HPCASIA.2005.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592320","Grid Service;Grid computing;High Performance Cluster;Service Oriented Grid Architecture","Computer architecture;Distributed computing;Engines;Grid computing;High performance computing;Monitoring;Prototypes;Scientific computing;Service oriented architecture;Software systems","grid computing;parallel architectures;workstation clusters","MPICH;N1 Grid Engine resource management tool;Open Solaris;Solaris Jumpstart technology;Sun Grid Engine;YellowRiver;cluster computing service;cluster service architecture;computational grid;distributed computing;grid computing;grid service;high performance computing;operating system deployment;service deployment;service execution;service monitoring;service oriented grid architecture;software systems;utility computing","","0","2","8","","","1-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A task gets executed and transferred seamlessly between cores in the proposed approach thereby achieving self-ware properties that characterize autonomic computing.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","9 pp.","","Today, we assist to the explosive development of mobile computing devices like PDAs and cellphones, the integration of embedded intelligence (like Web server) in more and more common devices, and the proliferation of wireless communication technologies (IRdA, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS). All these trends contribute to move us closer to the ubiquitous computing world described by Mark Weiser. But while the technology is here, applications, and more important, models and tools for designing future ambient computing systems are still rare. One of the first innovative concepts of ubiquitous computing, context-awareness is still hard to use and understand from a programming perspective. We think that the problem resides in the lack of system support: in traditional computing, operating system offers simple to use and easy to understand abstractions of computational resources. Ubiquitous computing involves an integration of ""computing"" into the real-world, which is a radically different environment for applications. We think that this environment requires new operating system services and abstractions. Because the real world is made of physical entities, ""living"" in the physical space, ambient computing software should be able to use abstraction representing such objects, in a simple way. In this paper, we present a light framework to design ubiquitous computing software, called SPREAD. Unlike many approaches which hides too much of the real-world behind traditional computing abstraction, SPREAD defines programming abstraction based on the properties of the physical space. Hence, physical properties, like relative proximity, are used as implicitly in SPREAD as variable addressing in a computer memory. In SPREAD, application (or process) behavior can be ""mechanically"" driven, in the sense that actions flow can be directly dependent of physical mobility. To support this concept, we introduce a programming and execution model allowing designing computing and information systems driven directly by arranging and moving physical objects in the space. We demonstrate the use of the model to implement a few practical applications, highlighting its simplicity and expression power.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174830","","Application software;Computer applications;Explosives;Mobile computing;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Physics computing;Power system modeling;Ubiquitous computing","data structures;distributed object management;information systems;mobile computing;operating systems (computers)","Bluetooth;GPRS;IEEE 802.11;IRdA;PDA;SPREAD approach;Spatial PRogramming Environment for Ambient Computing Design;Web server;ambient computing systems;cellphones;computational resources;computer memory;computing abstraction;context-awareness;embedded intelligence;execution model;information systems;mobile computing devices;object representing;operating system abstractions;operating system services;physical mobility;physical objects;programming abstraction;programming model;relative proximity;ubiquitous computing software;wireless communication technologies","","5","1","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ChinaGrid '09. Fourth","20091117","2009","","","xii","xv","Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditised and delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted. Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this utility computing vision and they include Grid computing, P2P computing, and more recently Cloud computing. The latter term denotes the infrastructure as a ""Cloud"" in which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in the world on demand. Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (application) as services, which are made available as subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to consumers. These services in industry are respectively referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). To realize Cloud computing, vendors such as Amazon, HP, IBM, and Sun are starting to create and deploy Clouds in various locations around the world. In addition, companies with global operations require faster response time, and thus save time by distributing workload requests to multiple Clouds in various locations at the same time. This creates the need for establishing a computing atmosphere for dynamically interconnecting and provisioning Clouds from multiple domains within and across enterprises. There are many challenges involved in creating such Clouds and Cloud interconnections. This keynote talk (1) presents the 21st century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (2) defines the architecture for creating market-oriented Clouds and computing atmosphere by leveraging technologies such as VMs; (3) provides thoughts on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk man- gement to sustain SLA-oriented resource allocation; (4) presents the work carried out as part of our recent initiative in cloud computing, called as Megha: (i) Aneka, a software system for providing PaaS within private or public Clouds and supporting market-oriented resource management, (ii) internetworking of Clouds for dynamic creation of federated computing environments for scaling of elastic applications, (iii) creation of 3rd party Cloud brokering services for content delivery network and e-Science applications and their deployment on capabilities of IaaS providers such as Amazon and Nirvanix along with Grid mashups, and (iv) CloudSim supporting modelling and simulation of Clouds for performance studies; and (5) concludes with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms for delivering our 21st century vision along with pathways for future research.","","978-0-7695-3818-1","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2009.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5329110","","","Web services;commerce;customer satisfaction;customer services;grid computing;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;risk management","Amazon;Aneka;CloudSim;Grid computing;Megha;Nirvanix;P2P computing;SLA-oriented resource allocation;cloud interconnections;computational risk management;content delivery network;customer-driven service management;e-Science application;infrastructure as a service;market-based resource management;market-oriented cloud computing;pay-as-you-go model;platform as a service;software as a service;subscription-based services;utility computing vision","","0","","","","","21-22 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the requirement that a computing system should run continuously and persistently is never taken into account as an essential and/or general requirement by traditional system design and development methodologies. As a result, a traditional computing system often has to stop its running and service when it needs to be maintained, upgraded, or reconfigured, it has some trouble, or it is attacked. This is not desirable to any pervasive (ubiquitous) service. This paper intends to propose a systematic and methodological solution to the problem: to develop persistent computing systems with soft system bus technology to provide an infrastructure for various pervasive services.

The operation and control of the power system is actually becoming a huge data-intensive, information-intensive, communication-intensive and computing-intensive application. Power systems rely more heavily on computerized communications and control. Therefore, system security has become increasingly dependent on protecting the integrity of the associated information systems. Grid computing is generally regarded as a software technology to fully use the spare computing resources. However, the philosophy of grid computing can be used in engineering case to play an important role in power system distributed monitoring, control and distributed parallel computing. This paper proposes a software architecture, which depends on grid computing for hardware support and agent technology for software support, to seamlessly integrate the dispersed computing resources to implement high-performance operation and computing in electric power system.

"On scheduling mesh-structured computations for Internet-based computing","Rosenberg, A.L.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Massachusetts Univ., Amherst, MA, USA","Computers, IEEE Transactions on","20040719","2004","53","9","1176","1186","Advances in technology have rendered the Internet a viable medium for employing multiple independent computers collaboratively in the solution of a single computational problem. A variety of mechanisms - e.g., Web-based computing, peer-to-peer computing, and grid computing - have been developed for such Internet-based computing (IC). Scheduling a computation for IC presents challenges that were not encountered with earlier modalities of parallel or distributed computing, especially when the computation's constituent tasks have interdependencies that constrain their order of execution. The process of scheduling such computations for IC is studied via a ""pebble game"" that abstracts the process of orchestrating the allocation of a computation's interdependent tasks to participating computers. A quality measure for plays of this game is developed that addresses the danger of ""gridlock"" in IC when a computation stalls because (due to dependencies) no tasks are eligible for execution. This measure rewards schedules that maximize the number of tasks that are eligible for execution at every step of the computation, one avenue for minimizing the likelihood of ""gridlock."" The resulting formal setting is illustrated via the problem of scheduling computations whose intertask dependencies have the structure of ""evolving"" meshes of finite dimensionalities. Within an idealized setting, a simple scheduling strategy is shown to be optimal when the dependencies have the structure of a two-dimensional mesh and within a constant factor of optimal for meshes of higher dimensionalities. The strategy remains optimal for a generalization of two-dimensional meshes whose structures are determined by abelian monoids (a monoid-based version of Cayley graphs). The optimality results for the idealized setting provide scheduling guidelines for real settings.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2004.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315610","65;Cayley graphs.;Index Terms- Internet-based computing;P2P computing;Web computing;grid computing;mesh-structured computations;monoid dags;scheduling","Abstracts;Biology computing;Collaboration;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Internet;Optical wavelength conversion;Peer to peer computing;Processor scheduling","Internet;game theory;graph theory;grid computing;group theory;mesh generation;optimisation;processor scheduling","Cayley graphs;Internet-based computing;Web-based computing;abelian monoids;distributed computing;grid computing;mesh-structured computations;monoid dags;pebble game;peer-to-peer computing","","20","","34","","","Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the key challenges of task computing paradigm is how to build the appropriate infrastructure in filling the gap between the tasks and the services. To solve the problem, this paper puts forward a user-centric task computing architecture for heterogeneous and dynamic pervasive computing environments which called U-TCA. The U-TCA focuses on sensing and abstracting user's requirement based task model on the one hand, and using middleware to mask the heterogeneity of computing environment on the other hand.

Such demands are traditionally supported by cluster-or Grid-based systems. Cloud computing, which has experienced a tremendous growth, emerged as an approach to provide on-demand access to computing resources. The cloud computing paradigm offers a number of advantages over other distributed platforms. For example, the access to resources is flexible and cost-effective since it is not necessary to invest a large amount of money on a computing infrastructure nor pay salaries for maintenance functions. Therefore, the possibility of using cloud computing for running high performance computing applications is attractive. However, it has been shown elsewhere that current cloud computing platforms are not suitable for running this kind of applications since the performance offered is very poor. The reason is mainly the overhead from virtualisation which is extensively used by most cloud computing platforms as a means to optimise resource usage. In this paper, we present a lightweight virtualisation approach applied to WRF, a challenging communication-intensive, high performance computing application. Our experimental results show that lightweight virtualisation imposes about 5% overhead and it substantially outperforms traditional heavy-weight virtualisation such as VMware.","","978-1-4577-2116-8","","10.1109/UCC.2011.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123492","cloud computing;high performance computing;lightweight virtual machines;virtualisation","Cloud computing;High performance computing;Kernel;Meteorology;Monitoring;Production facilities;Virtual machining","cloud computing;grid computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","cloud computing;cluster-based system;forecasting model;grid-based system;high performance computing;lightweight virtual machine;maintenance function;on-demand access;scientific application;virtualisation;weather research","","0","","29","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As cloud computing becomes more widespread, the energy consumption of the network and computing resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology (ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to the cloud. In this paper, we present an analysis of energy consumption in cloud computing. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. We show that energy consumption in transport and switching can be a significant percentage of total energy consumption in cloud computing. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient use of computing power, especially when the computing tasks are of low intensity or infrequent. However, under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC).","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2060451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559320","Cloud computing;core networks;data centers;energy consumption","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Green design;Power demand","cloud computing;computer centres;energy consumption","computing resources;data center energy use;data processing;data storage;energy balancing;energy consumption;green cloud computing;information and communications technology sector;network resources;network-based cloud computing;private clouds;public clouds;switching networks;transmission networks","","119","","59","","2010-08-30","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on","20050919","2005","","","891","897","In recent years, grid computing that integrates geographically distributed computing resources through communication networks captures the spotlight. Unlike parallel computing using conventional cluster computer systems, wide-area grid computing must resolve the following issues for effectively utilizing geographically distributed computing resources. First, since computing resources are shared by multiple users, the amount of available resources in a site changes over time. Second, since sites are geographically distributed, the transfer delay between sites cannot be neglected for computing resource management. For utilizing computing resources effectively, the amount of jobs injected into a site must be dynamically controlled according to the dynamically changing amount of available resources in sites. However, the transfer delay of a network is significant, so that it is not trivial for a resource allocation controller to quickly and dynamically adopt to the change in the amount of available resources in sites. In this paper, a dynamic resources management mechanism for wide-area grid computing called DRM-DC (dynamic resource management with delay compensator) based on control theory is proposed. The main feature of our DRM-DC is that it realizes high steady state and transient state performance in wide-area grid computing using a delay compensator called Smith predictor. Moreover, several discrete-time simulations using a Simgrid simulator are performed, and the effectiveness of our DRM-DC is demonstrated","","0-7803-9354-6","","10.1109/CCA.2005.1507242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1507242","","Communication networks;Communication system control;Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Delay;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Parallel processing;Resource management;Time sharing computer systems","control theory;delays;discrete time systems;grid computing;resource allocation","DRM-DC;Simgrid simulator;Smith predictor;cluster computer systems;communication network;computing resource;control theory;discrete-time simulation;dynamic resource management with delay compensator;geographically distributed computing;parallel computing;transfer delay;wide-area grid computing","","2","","9","","","28-31 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore conducted a study of Mission Scientists' computing behaviors and workflows, to learn how science gets done, on which computing and storage resources, where and when throughout project lifecycles. In our approach we conducted in-depth interviews with scientists that actively use the spectrum of computing and storage resources across the agency; identifying, discussing, and analyzing behavioral patterns to discern computing and storage needs. In each interview we learned the stepwise processes (workflows) used to generate, transport, manage, and use data; including scientists' interactions with computing and storage resources, frequencies, durations, and types of interactions, and dependencies and constraints in progression through steps. During our study we identified a wide variety of usage scenarios across the target communities, however, we found underlying behaviors between scientists, the computing and storage resources they use, and the data sets they create; in particular, how scientists use their data and how they interact with various computing resources at each stage in their projects. These behaviors are influenced by limiting factors in the IT system, such as queues, consistency across resources, data set sizes, storage allocations, and retrieving data from offline storage. Limiting factors increase scientists' times to solution and reduce their effectiveness, by forcing them to adapt their behaviors to accommodate these factors, including: creatively using queues, reprocessing jobs instead of storing data sets, shuffling data sets across resources during processing, saving data at fewer intervals, and reducing scales, resolutions, and numbers of parameters of jobs. We found that, underl- ing scientists' computing and storage behaviors, and how they adapt to limiting factors in the IT system, are sets of dynamics between scientists, the computing and storage resources they use, and the data sets they create. We use the term behavioral dynamics to indicate behaviors that are conditioned by working environments, for our study consisting of subsets of scientists' IT (computing, storage, and networking) environments. We describe dynamics between performance and control, as well as between security and collaboration. We believe that behavioral dynamics such as these can be used to improve the effectiveness of science workflows and times to solution, by: tuning and balancing the IT system for Mission Communities; identifying major short and long-term drivers for computing, storage, and networking; and providing input into architectural decisions. Possible refinements to the IT system include: adopting a more consistent queue strategy across MRC and HEC resources; developing a brokering capability for these resources; exploring architectural implications of large data sets; and providing open and flexible environments for collaborations via proxy access, implementing open computing and storage, or outsourcing to public cloud services.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0556-4","","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187358","","Analytical models;Communities;Computational modeling;Data models;Interviews;Limiting;NASA","aerospace computing;data handling;database management systems;information retrieval;storage management","HEC resource;IT system;MRC resource;Mission Communities;Mission scientist computing behavior;NASA computing needs assessment;architectural decision;behavioral dynamics;behavioral patterns;computing resources;consistent queue strategy;data set management;data set shuffling;job reprocessing;networking;open computing;outsourcing;project lifecycles;proxy access;public cloud services;science workflows;stepwise process;storage resources;usage scenarios","","0","","7","","","3-10 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The latter term denotes the infrastructure as a Cloud in which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in the world on demand. Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (application) as services, which are made available as subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to consumers. These services in industry are respectively referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). To realize Cloud computing potential, vendors such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM are starting to create and deploy Clouds in various locations around the world. In addition, companies with global operations require faster response time, and thus save time by distributing workload requests to multiple Clouds in various locations at the same time. This creates the need for establishing a computing atmosphere for dynamically interconnecting and provisioning Clouds from multiple domains within and across enterprises. There are many challenges involved in creating such Clouds and Cloud interconnections.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679963","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679963","","Australia;Cloud computing;Clouds;Computational modeling;Grid computing;Resource management;Software","business data processing;cloud computing;grid computing;information technology;peer-to-peer computing","Amazon;Google;IBM;Microsoft;P2P computing;cloud computing;grid computing;information technology;infrastructure as a service;platform as a service;software as a service","","3","","","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It offers potential benefits to users in terms of instant availability, scalability and resource sharing, while potentially posing security issues. Especially, recent events like Amazons system failure increased the concerns related to cloud computing. Given these security and reliability concerns , we explore the optimal decision rule for moving certain IT function to public clouds. We formulate the problem as an entrepreneurial decision for an optimal stopping time at which the entrepreneur shall migrate to the cloud computing paradigm. Two different models are presented. Recognizing that an important and specific issue related to different computing paradigm is the potential ""security"" risk posed by each technology, we consider security risks in both models. The first model approaches the optimal adoption problem from assessing the cloud computing adoption under project value uncertainty. The entrepreneur has the timing flexibility and solves his optimal adoption decision under uncertainty. The optimal adoption rule obtained is a threshold strategy. A firm should adopt the cloud computing only if the value from the adoption exceeds the threshold level. The second model builds on a comprehensive assessment of two different computing paradigms. The entrepreneur can either keep the traditional on-site computing paradigm or migrate to the cloud computing paradigm. His problem is to make the paradigm shift optimally. We model such a problem as optimally swapping two ""risky"" assets, which refer to benefits of the traditional on-site computing paradigm and those of the cloud computing paradigm. The term ""risky"" captures the fact that actual benefits can only be resolved through time, and thus estimates of benefits are embedded with uncertainty. We obtain the optimal swapping rule as a threshold strategy, defined in terms of the two benefit ratio. A firm should only shift the part of its bus- ness to the cloud computing service if the ratio, the benefit from the cloud computing paradigm over that from the traditional on-site computing paradigm, exceeds the threshold. In both models, both the extent of riskiness (i.e. uncertainty) and the significance of security risks (both in terms of potential occurrence probability and the severity of damage) affect the threshold level, thus the entrepreneurial adoption decision.","","978-1-4577-1817-5","","10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120232","","Biological system modeling;Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Security;Uncertainty","business data processing;cloud computing;risk management;security of data","Amazons system failure;IT function;business;cloud computing adoption;entrepreneurial decision;information technology domain;optimal adoption problem;optimal decision rule exploration;optimal stopping time;optimal swapping rule;project value uncertainty;public clouds;reliability concerns;security risk impact;threshold strategy","","4","","11","","","28-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software failures. Dependability assurance is crucial for building sustainable cloud computing services. Although many techniques have been proposed to analyze and enhance reliability of distributed systems, there is little work on understanding the dependability of cloud computing environments. As virtualization has been an enabling technology for the cloud, it is imperative to investigate the impact of virtualization on the cloud dependability, which is the focus of this work. In this paper, we present a cloud dependability analysis (CDA) framework with mechanisms to characterize failure behavior in cloud computing infrastructures. We design the failure-metric DAGs (directed a cyclic graph) to analyze the correlation of various performance metrics with failure events in virtualized and non-virtualized systems. We study multiple types of failures. By comparing the generated DAGs in the two environments, we gain insight into the impact of virtualization on the cloud dependability. This paper is the first attempt to study this crucial issue. In addition, we exploit the identified metrics for failure detection. Experimental results from an on-campus cloud computing test bed show that our approach can achieve high detection accuracy while using a small number of performance metrics.","","978-1-4673-4849-2","978-0-7695-4885-2","10.1109/PRDC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385066","Cloud Computing;Dependability;Evaluation;Failure Management;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Correlation;Measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;directed graphs;software fault tolerance;software reliability;system recovery;virtualisation","CDA;cloud computing environments;cloud computing infrastructures;cloud dependability analysis framework;complex computing infrastructure;dependability assurance;directed acyclic graph;distributed system reliability;failure detection;failure-metric DAG;hardware failures;nonvirtualized systems;on-campus cloud computing testbed;production cloud computing systems;software failures;sustainable cloud computing services;system dependability characterization;virtualization","","6","","47","","","18-19 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides a low-cost, highly accessible alternative to other traditional high-performance computing platforms. It also has many other benefits such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, and free of maintenance. Given these attractive features, it is very desirable if automated planning can exploit the large, affordable computational power of cloud computing. However, the latency in inter-process communication in cloud computing makes most existing parallel planning algorithms unsuitable for cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a portfolio stochastic search framework that takes advantage of and is suitable for cloud computing. We first study the running time distribution of Monte-Carlo Random Walk (MRW) search, a stochastic planning algorithm, and show that the running time distribution usually has remarkable variability. Then, we propose a portfolio search algorithm that is suitable for cloud computing, which typically has abundant computing cores but high communication latency between cores. Further, we introduce an enhanced portfolio with multiple parameter settings to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. We implement the portfolio search algorithm in both a local cloud and the Windows Azure cloud. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves good, in many cases super linear, speedup in the cloud platforms. Moreover, our algorithm greatly reduces the running time variance of the stochastic search and improves the solution quality. We also show that our scheme is economically sensible and robust under processor failures.","","978-1-4673-0090-2","","10.1109/CloudCom.2011.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133120","automated planning;cloud computing;stochastic search","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Planning;Portfolios;Stochastic processes","Monte Carlo methods;cloud computing;parallel algorithms;random processes;search problems;stochastic processes","MRW search;Monte-Carlo random walk search;Windows Azure cloud;automated planning;cloud computing;communication latency;computational power;computing cores;computing model;enhanced portfolio;high-performance computing platforms;inter-process communication;local cloud;multiple parameter settings;parallel planning algorithms;portfolio search algorithm;portfolio stochastic search framework;processor failures;running time distribution;stochastic planning algorithm","","1","","25","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though simple and applicable, AFOSM Method has shortcomings when distribution forms of random variable are concerned. In some cases, the distribution types of variables can be worked out through statistics analysis. Thus it is necessary to adopt appropriate methods to work out possible impacts of variable distribution. Stochastic BEM, based on Monte-Carlo numerical simulation, is capable to simulate such impacts effectively as a method of statistical approximation. But the coefficient matrix is asymmetric full-matrix in the solution of BEM matrix equation, the computational complexity increase by N3 with the increase of boundary node number. On solving the complex large-scale three dimensions structure problem, the large computational scale has been a barrier in the application of boundary element method, especially for the Stochastic BEM computation. Grid computing is a new style of distributed computing technology after the cluster computing. Grid is a integrated environment of computing and resource, which realize sharing resource and cooperative teamwork .It can absorb various computing resources and translate the min to convenient and reliable computer power. On the campus grid platform, the single or multiple large-scale BEM computing could carry out expediently and efficiently. This paper took the case of a campus grid in Hohai university, and introduced the characteristic of grid computing and the three-layer frame of the campus grid such as resource layer, grid layer and application service layer, and the campus grid platform is a system based on two-level scheduler, respectively grid layer scheduler and resource layer scheduler, thus a two-level parallel strategy in the above two layers can be adopted for the computing of stochastic BEM which has two parallel specialties in both BEM computing and Monte-Carlo method. Then the realization of stochastic - - BEM based on grid platform was put forward. Finally, there is a test which shows the high performance and efficiency of the two-level parallel strategy for the stochastic BEM computing on the grid platform.","","978-1-4244-9712-6","978-0-7695-4335-2","10.1109/CSO.2011.218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5957639","grid computation;hpc;stochastic bem","Computer architecture;Computers;Grid computing;Monte Carlo methods;Portals;Reliability;Teamwork","Monte Carlo methods;boundary-elements methods;grid computing;mathematics computing;matrix algebra;software reliability;statistical analysis","AFOSM Method;BEM matrix equation;Monte Carlo numerical simulation;application service layer;campus grid;cluster computing;grid computing;grid layer;reliability computing;resource layer;statistical approximation;stochastic BEM","","0","","5","","","15-19 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the current commercial clouds have been built to support web and small database workloads, which are very different from typical scientific computing workloads. Moreover, the use of virtualization and resource time sharing may introduce significant performance penalties for the demanding scientific computing workloads.

No longer a research project or an offering by a leading edge internet company aimed at leading edge developers, Cloud Computing has become mainstream. The IT landscape is changing because of Cloud Computing, in how companies and researchers obtain computing resources as a serve, and also in how companies and researchers construct their own computing environments. At first, Cloud Computing was a new way to use existing servers, networking, and storage. Now the second generation of servers, networking, and storage, along with a wave of brand new software is emerging, because of the innovation possible in this new infrastructure. In other words, Cloud Computing has become a transformational factor in modern IT development. Our introduction to cloud computing will begin with a very commonly accepted set of definitions, terminology, and reference architecture. The definitions and architectures come from the US Department of Commerce, where the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did some early, foundational standardization work in Cloud Computing. These definitions and canonical scenarios will set the stage for how we talk about Cloud Computing for the rest of the course. We will then turn to study a number of general Cloud Computing use cases and usage scenarios. There are many ways Cloud Computing can be set up and put to work, and there are many layers and sub-systems in Cloud Computing which we will want to have a precise vocabulary for, in order to consistently proceed in our studies of each and every part, and in how the parts fit together.","","1-4673-3233-X","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=EDP382","cloud computing;computing","","","","","","","","","","12/31/2014","","IEEE","IEEE Courses"

For instance, a process in one place can send an object to other places; a process can request an object from a remote provider; a process can be moved from one place to another and then continue its execution; a message might travel through many intermediaries before its destination. Too many participants in one action might cause computational complications. It is better if the system structure can be at proved before the action really takes place.

However, the emerging of ubiquitous computing has brought many challenges, one of which is that it is hard to allow users to freely obtain desired services, such as heterogeneous OSes and applications via different light-weight devices. We have proposed a new paradigm, called Transparent Computing, to store and manage the commodity programs including OS codes centrally, while stream them to be run in non-state clients. This leads to a service-centric computing environment, in which users can select the desired services on demand, without concerning these services' administrations, such as their installation, maintenance, management, upgrade, and so on. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept: Meta OS to support such program streaming through a distributed 4VP<sup>+</sup> platform.

On the other hand, Grid computing offers large-scale high performance distributed computing which connects various types of computing resources on the Internet. In this paper, we design a Grid computing platform called the Massively Multi-user Online Platform (MMOP). The objectives of this proposed design are to offer scalability, flexibility, and simplicity to the development processes of distributed applications. MMOP allows executions of applications based on specified policy rules with dynamic addition of computing resources at run-time. Each application is managed separately, and multiple large-scale applications can share a single computing architecture. An online game has been built to test the functional behavior of the MMOP.

"Cloud Computing Introduction","","","Cloud Computing Introduction","","2014","","","","","In this course, we will discuss how Cloud Computing is really changing both the technology model and business model of Information Technology. We will next talk about the ""Hype Curve"" as popularized by the Gartner Group. Their work tracks new technologies through their ""hype"" lifecycle, where one can see many technologies do not have a successful journey from their introduction ""as the latest new thing"" to real mature technology products in a long lasting marketplace. We will see where Cloud Computing fits in this lifecycle analysis. We will look at the genealogy of Cloud Computing, in terms of where it evolved from and what the important, original conceptual elements were. From this, we will be able to understand why Cloud Computing caused such a massive ""Paradigm Shift"" in how computing was done. Cloud Computing has become such a well accepted movement with real technical and business benefits. While initially a new way to combine computing, networking, and storage, Cloud Computing is now causing a new wave of innovation in those underlying fields. Computing, Networking, and Storage are evolving to support the new scale and automation dimensions of Cloud Computing. Many will point out Cloud Computing's roots in ""Grid Computing""?, a super-computer technique employed in Academia and Research. In many ways, Grid paved the way for innovations in Cloud. However, Grid is not the same as Cloud, as will be shown. We will look at the Anatomy of Cloud Computing, and compare it with Grid.","","1-4673-3232-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=EDP381","cloud computing;computing","","","","","","","","","","12/31/2014","","IEEE","IEEE Courses"

Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, MA, USA","Cluster Computing (CLUSTER), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20121025","2012","","","622","626","In cluster computing, power and cooling represent a significant cost compared to the hardware itself. This is of special concern in the cloud, which provides access to large numbers of computers. We examine the use of ARM-based clusters for low-power, high performance computing. This work examines two likely use-modes: (i) a standard dedicated cluster, and (ii) a cluster of pre-configured virtual machines in the cloud. A 40-node department-level cluster based on an ARM Cortex-A9 is compared against a similar cluster based on an Intel Core2 Duo, in contrast to a recent similar study on just a 4-node cluster. For the NAS benchmarks on 32-node clusters, ARM was found to have a power efficiency ranging from 1.3 to 6.2 times greater than that of Intel. This is despite Intel's approximately five times greater performance. The particular efficiency ratio depends primarily on the size of the working set relative to L2 cache. In addition to energy-efficient computing, this study also emphasizes fault tolerance: an important ingredient in high performance computing. It relies on two recent extensions to the DMTCP checkpoint-restart package. DMTCP was extended (i) to support ARM CPUs, and (ii) to support check pointing of the Qemu virtual machine in user-mode. DMTCP is used both to checkpoint native distributed applications, and to checkpoint a network of virtual machines. This latter case demonstrates the ability to deploy pre-configured software in virtual machines hosted in the cloud, and further to migrate cluster computation between hosts in the cloud.","","978-1-4673-2422-9","","10.1109/CLUSTER.2012.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337837","ARM;checkpoint-restart;cluster computing;energy-efficient computing;high performance computing","Benchmark testing;Checkpointing;Computer architecture;Computers;High performance computing;Sockets;Virtual machining","cache storage;checkpointing;cloud computing;energy conservation;fault tolerant computing;parallel architectures;parallel machines;power aware computing;virtual machines;workstation clusters","32-node clusters;40-node department-level cluster;ARM CPU;ARM Cortex-A9;ARM-based clusters;DMTCP checkpoint-restart package;L2 cache;Qemu virtual machine;checkpoint native distributed application;cloud computing;cluster computing;cooling;energy-efficient computing;fault tolerant energy-efficient high performance computing;low-power computing;power efficiency;preconfigured software deployment;preconfigured virtual machine cluster","","0","","18","","","24-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The standard model of quantum computing, namely, the circuit model, starts with the product state, and quantum gates are applied in order to create entanglement among qubits. The output state is measured only at the end of the computing to read out the computation result. On the other hand, in the measurement-based model, universal quantum computing can be done with the preparation of a multipartite quantum state and adaptive measurements on each qubit of it. It is shown that the computational power of the measurement-based quantum computing is equivalent to the circuit model. However, the measurement-based model has provided new points of view to deepen our understanding of quantum computing and to explore further relations between quantum computing and other fields of physics and information science. In fact, plenty of new results have been obtained about relations between the measurement-based quantum computing and, for example, graph theory, statistical physics, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, etc. It's inherent multipartiteness is also expected to be more suitable for multipartite information processing than the traditional circuit model. In this talk, we first review the basics of the measurement-based quantum computing, and next explain some recent applications of it to information theory, including acausal network, topological quantum computing, and secure cloud quantum computing.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979858","","Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Protocols;Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics","cloud computing;information theory;quantum entanglement;quantum gates;security of data","acausal network;adaptive measurements;circuit model;cloud quantum computing security;entanglement;information theory;measurement-based quantum computing;multipartite information processing;multipartite quantum state;output state measurement;product state;quantum gates;qubits;topological quantum computing","","0","","","","","26-29 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main ideas of pervasive/ubiquitous computing include 1) the fusion of cyberspace and physical space, 2) the distraction-free computing. Context awareness is the effort for computer systems to sense and leverage the rich context information in the dual space. It has been recognized as a promising approach to reach the goal of invisibility, which can provide attentive service for user. As a basic service in the computing environment, context-aware service is with four basic functions of collecting, storing, reasoning and querying. The reasoning and inosculating module are for formal reasoning module; the context base module provides the function of storing data and querying; the querying and subscribing module gives the non-processing interface for upper application to request context service; the raw data acquiring module acquires the raw data from the sensors and profile files. Not only can the computing framework provide context common service, but it has favorable expansibility and adaptability. And, location-aware computing is a representative research area of context-aware computing. For which we proposed 1) a multi-object-tracking, highly-precise indoor positioning system, Cicada, to acquire the objects' location in smart space, 2) an expeditious and active location-aware service model, which not only to provide rapid location-related query service to applications, but also to offer the active spatial event service.

One is the distributed monitoring and control implemented by using virtual database technology. Another is the distributed parallel computing of power system. This paper describes the whole infrastructure of the system. All the computing devices in the electric power system can be wrapped into integrity to realize distributed monitoring and control to provide support for the operation and control of electric power system. While the computers of high performance and tightly interconnected are organized by resource pooling to form a computing pool, to facilitate the distributed parallel computation. The paper first discusses the visualization of the resource, and the application of virtual database technology to realize the distributed data access and control. Then the structure for realizing the distributed parallel computing, especially the computing pool, resource and task scheduling, solution of differential algebraic equation and graph partition, is described. Finally the test benches built at laboratory are described and the test results are presented.

In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we review the existing results on modeling and simulation of cloud computing. We start from reviewing the basic concepts of cloud computing and its security issues, and subsequently review the existing cloud computing simulators.

In this article, the cloud computing technology architecture and the cloud computing data security features are the first to be studied and considered, then the cloud computing data security model is raised. At last, the realization of data security model has been researched. The model adopts a multi-dimension architecture of three - layers defense. First of all, user authentication is required to ensure that user data cannot be tampered. Users who pass the anthentication can get relative operation on the user data, such as addition, modification, deletion. If the unauthorized user use illegal means to deceive the authentication system, the file entered the system encrypt and privacy defense levels. In this layer, user data is encrypted.

We show that using DVS only during the slack-time does not penalize the performances but it does not provide significant energy savings.

This is due to the relative scalability, ease of use, advanced user environment customization abilities clouds provide, as well as many novel computing paradigms available for data-intensive applications. However, there is concern about a performance gap that exists between the performance of IaaS when compared to typical high performance computing (HPC) resources, which could limit the applicability of IaaS for many potential scientific users. Most recently, general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs or GPUs) have become commonplace within high performance computing. We look to bridge the gap between supercomputing and clouds by providing GPU-enabled virtual machines (VMs) and investigating their feasibility for advanced scientific computation. Specifically, the Xen hypervisor is utilized to leverage specialized hardware-assisted I/O virtualization and PCI passthrough in order to provide advanced HPC-centric Nvidia GPUs directly in guest VMs. This methodology is evaluated by measuring the performance of two Nvidia Tesla GPUs within Xen VMs and comparing to bare-metal hardware. Results show PCI passthrough of GPUs within virtual machines is a viable use case for many scientific computing workflows, and could help support high performance cloud infrastructure in the near future.","","978-1-4799-4117-9","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969471","Cloud computing;GPUs;HPC;IaaS;Scientific Computing","Benchmark testing;Cloud computing;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Performance evaluation;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;graphics processing units;natural sciences computing;parallel processing;virtual machines;virtualisation","GPGPUs;GPU passthrough evaluation;GPU-enabled virtual machines;HPC resources;HPC-centric Nvidia GPUs;IaaS;Nvidia Tesla GPUs;PCI passthrough;Xen VMs;Xen hypervisor;data-intensive applications;general-purpose graphics processing units;hardware-assisted I/O virtualization;high performance cloud computing;high performance cloud infrastructure;high performance computing;infrastructure-as-a-service;performance measurement;scientific computation;scientific computing community;scientific computing workflows;supercomputing;technical computing needs","","0","","40","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the bandwidth limitation of wireless network, it spends about four minutes or more of the time with traditional unicast in the mobile transparent computing environment on loading TNOS from servers. In this paper, multicast is used in the mobile transparent computing. Mobile transparent computing generally use the wireless local area network (WLAN) or 3G network. After studying the characteristics of the wireless multicast, we propose an efficient multicast grouping mechanism in mobile transparent computing over WLAN.

Major firms in the computing industry such as IBM, HP, and SUN Microsystems are focusing on agility and flexibility of computing resources and gearing up for their own versions of on-demand computing and IT outsourcing solutions. Successful business advent of these new computing models requires the development of appropriate pricing mechanisms that are consistent with the enabling technologies. Our paper presents preliminary research in this area, and introduces the notion of contingent auctions to address this lacuna. In contingent auctions, users bid for computing resources in an auction, but are relieved from the contract if demand is not realized. We study different mechanisms - ranging from an advance-commit (capacity reservation) to no-commit (pay-as-you-go) - under such demand uncertainty. We show how the different levels of commitment affect prices, revenues and resource utilization. Our initial results show promise and reiterate the need to address the availability-commitment dichotomy in the design of business models for on-demand computing and IT outsourcing.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265505","","Appropriate technology;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Computer networks;Computer vision;Grid computing;Outsourcing;Pervasive computing;Pricing;Sun","electronic commerce;information technology;outsourcing;pricing","IT outsourcing;availability-commitment dichotomy;business computing;contingent auctions;contingent bids;e-services economy;grid computing;network computing architectures;on-demand computing services;pricing mechanisms","","2","","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During the past few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business idea to one of the fastest growing parts of the IT industry. IT organizations have expresses concern about critical issues (such as security) that exist with the widespread implementation of cloud computing. These types of concerns originate from the fact that data is stored remotely from the customer's location; in fact, it can be stored at any location. Security, in particular, is one of the most argued-about issues in the cloud computing field; several enterprises look at cloud computing warily due to projected security risks. The risks of compromised security and privacy may be lower overall, however, with cloud computing than they would be if the data were to be stored on individual machines instead of in a so - called ""cloud"" (the network of computers used for remote storage and maintenance). Comparison of the benefits and risks of cloud computing with those of the status quo are necessary for a full evaluation of the viability of cloud computing. Consequently, some issues arise that clients need to consider as they contemplate moving to cloud computing for their businesses. In this paper I summarize reliability, availability, and security issues for cloud computing (RAS issues), and propose feasible and available solutions for some of them.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014715","Cloud Computing;Countermeasure;DoS;Security","Certification;Computers;Fires;Programming;Security","cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","IT industry;IT organization;cloud computing availability;cloud computing reliability;cloud computing security threat;computer process flexibility;computer process scalability;cost reduction;data privacy;security risks","","31","","14","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is defined as on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. network). The main idea of cloud is to provide on-demand computing services with high reliability, scalability and availability in a distributed environment. Outsourcing and extension of business through cloud has provided customer an ease of the local data storage and maintenance. However, the customer no longer has physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data. This draws a security concern on the data integrity protection in cloud computing especially for customers with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Security is one of the major factor that hampers the growth of cloud computing. An estimation of security risks in cloud computing systems is an essential part of the process of security measures. For a proper estimation of security risk requires a good knowledge about the probability distributions of different upcoming events. This paper focuses on security measures and simulation of security risk in cloud computing. Probability distribution model is used for simulation of possible security risk in cloud services.","","978-1-4799-2763-0","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6745284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745284","Cloud computing;Security risk;Service delivery models","Availability;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Memory;Security;Servers","cloud computing;security of data;statistical distributions","cloud computing;data integrity protection;distributed environment;ondemand computing service;ondemand network access;probability distribution model;security measure;security risk","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware advances over the past several decades have been empirically observed with remarkable precision to obey Moore's law, predicting an increase in transistor density by about a factor of two every eighteen months. Maintaining these improvements has become problematic as power dissipation and other size-limiting factors become more pronounced at smaller feature size. Reconfigurable computing, or heterogeneous computing, is offering hope to the scientific computing community as a way to provide continued growth in computing capability.

In a mobile grid environment, the Grid acts as a resource hungry consumer whereas in ubiquitous computing environments, it has the inherent potential to provide services to applications. The enormous growth in the use of mobile and embedded devices in ubiquitous computing environment and their interaction with human beings produces a huge amount of data that needs to be processed swiftly anytime anywhere. However, most devices used in ubiquitous environments have limited resources in terms of CPU, storage, battery power and communication bandwidth. In such ubiquitous computing platforms, there is a need to transfer application services to computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Grid as a candidate for provisioning computational services to applications in ubiquitous computing environments. In particular, we present a competitive model that describes the possible interaction between the competing resources in the Grid Infrastructure as service providers and ubiquitous applications as subscribers. The competition takes place in terms of quality of service (QoS) offered by different Grid Service Providers. The ubiquitous users' resource demands depend not only on the QoS parameters (e.g., response time and loss probability in our context) offered by that service provider but also upon those of its competitors. We develop a stochastic equilibrium model for QoS assurance. Based upon those QoS parameters, we propose two types of demand models whose distribution functions are closely correlated with service level QoS parameters. We proceed to present the equilibrium behavior of our model facing global competition under stochastic demand and estimation of guaranteed QoS assurance level satisfying the requirement of ubiquitous application efficiently. Simulation results show that our proposed framework maximizes the provider's expected revenue at the optimal point of different QoS parameters.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419918","Grid Computing;Mahalanobis Distance;Nash-Equilibrium;Pervasive Devices;Price Elasticity;Stochastic Demand;Ubiquitous Computing","Availability;Computer applications;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Humans;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Quality of service;Stochastic processes;Ubiquitous computing","embedded systems;grid computing;pricing;quality of service;stochastic processes;ubiquitous computing","Mahalanobis distance;Nash-equilibrium;QoS;computational resources;distributed computing environments;embedded devices;grid service providers;mobile grid environment;price elasticity;quality of service;stochastic demand;stochastic equilibrium model;ubiquitous computing","","5","7","18","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in order to be used effectively, their heterogeneity, volatility and restrictive computing models must be overcome. As these computing grids are open, incorrect or malicious results must also be handled. This paper examines extending the BOINC volunteer computing framework to allow for asynchronous global optimization as applied to scientific computing problems. The asynchronous optimization method used is resilient to faults and the heterogeneous nature of volunteer computing grids, while allowing scalability to tens of thousands of hosts. A work verification strategy that does not require the validation of every result is presented. This is shown to be able to effectively reduce the need for verification done to less than 30% of the reported results, without degrading the performance of the asynchronous search methods. An asynchronous version of particle swarm optimization (APSO) is presented and com- pared to previously used asynchronous genetic search (AGS) using the MilkyWay@Home BOINC computing project. Both search methods are shown to scale to MilkyWay@Home's current user base, over 75,000 heterogeneous and volatile hosts, something not possible for traditional optimization methods. APSO is shown to provide faster convergence to optimal results while being less sensitive to its search parameters. The verification strategy presented is shown to be effective for both AGS and APSO.","","978-0-7695-3877-8","","10.1109/e-Science.2009.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380857","astroinformatics;asynchronous optimziation;genetic search;particle swarm;volunteer computing","Costs;Degradation;Grid computing;Mesh generation;Optimization methods;Power generation;Robustness;Scalability;Scientific computing;Search methods","grid computing;particle swarm optimisation","BOINC volunteer computing;MilkyWay@Home BOINC computing project;asynchronous global optimization;particle swarm optimization;scientific computing problems;volunteer computing grids;work verification strategy","","1","","27","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile applications have become more popular all across the world. By removing the limitations of mobile devices with respect to storage and computing capabilities and providing new integrated levels of security by centralized maintenance of security-critical software, e.g., mobile payment applications, it is expected that it will find broad acceptance on the business as well as consumer side. Studies indicate that Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) will additionally help to make visions of context-aware services as real world applications. However, Mobile Cloud Computing concepts rely on an always-on connectivity and will need to provide a scalable and when requested high-quality mobile access. A review study has been done on Mobile Cloud Computing. It exploits the specific information available by the “Mobile Cloud Controller”, i.e., the users' location, context, and requested services, and significantly evolves the Heterogeneous Access Management schemes developed for the traditional heterogeneous access scenarios. In order to evaluate the performance of these intelligent radio access management concepts in the framework of Mobile Cloud Computing, a specialized radio network simulator will be introduced. It will be revealed that a Mobile Cloud Controller establishing Context Management Architecture (CMA) can provide the requested availability and quality of mobile connectivity. In this paper a comprehensive review has been carried out in the context of Mobile Cloud Computing.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100410","Context quality enabler;Heterogeneous access management (HAM);MobiLife;Mobile cloud computing","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Context;Context-aware services;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Wireless communication","cloud computing;mobile computing;radio access networks;safety-critical software;security of data;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;telecommunication security","CMA;MCC;always-on connectivity;centralized security-critical software maintenance;computing capabilities;context aware mobile cloud computing;context management architecture;heterogeneous access management schemes;integrated security levels;intelligent radio access management concepts;mobile cloud controller;mobile connectivity;mobile devices;mobile payment applications;mobile services;radio network simulator;storage capabilities;user experience improvement","","0","","","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the widespread acceptance of cloud computing, computing resources including computational power, storage, development platform and applications will be available as services. Hitherto computing resources were considered capital items and customers used to pay for these resources as for any other product. Cloud computing changes all these and consumers will pay only for what is consumed similar to other services or utilities. When cloud computing becomes more popular, different vendors would provide different services at different levels of qualities and prices. Hence customers will have to identify the differences in quality offered by different service providers and need to select the right service provider based on their requirements. A trust management system will match the service providers and the customers based on the requirements customers and the capabilities of service providers. In this paper, the authors propose a trust management system along with a trust evolution mechanism that can be used to measure the performance of services based on the response time of systems. The proposed mechanism formulates trust scores for different service level requirements based on assurance (confidence) levels. Hence this mechanism is suitable for managing multiple service levels against single trust score for all the service levels. Also the proposed mechanism is adaptive as it continuously modifies the scores based on the performance of the system. The proposed mechanism has been tested in a simulated environment and the results are found to be satisfactory.","","978-1-4577-0032-3","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2011.6038113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6038113","cloud computing;multilevel thresholding;quality of service;trust;trust management","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Conferences;Hardware;Quality of service;Time factors","business data processing;cloud computing;security of data","Hitherto computing resources;cloud computing;multilevel thresholding;trust computing mechanism;trust evolution mechanism;trust management system","","4","","20","","","16-19 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has enriched the applications of cloud computing, ranging from industry, business, to scientific fields. Nowadays cloud computing has become one of the important research issues in the computing and computer network fields. A cloud computing system consists of several independent servers. By way of the virtualization technique, the system manages all of the computing resources efficiently to process each user demand. However, a great number of operating servers will bring considerable power consumption. Efficient resource allocation methods design is one of the important solution approaches to relieve this situation. A resource allocation method will generally allocate each arriving job to proper available computing resources (the virtual machines, VMs) based on the consideration of the related features (such as the job size, the arrival time, etc.) of jobs in the waiting queue. Although the future arrival jobs are unknown, they will significantly affect the resulting performance of the resource allocation. In this paper, we develop an Energy Conserving Resource Allocation Scheme with Prediction (ECRASP) for cloud computing systems. The prediction mechanism can predict the trend of arriving jobs (dense or sparse) in the near future and their related features, so as with help the system to make adequate decisions. Simulation results show that our proposed ECRASP method performs well compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms in the energy conserving comparisons.","","","","10.1109/GRC.2014.6982857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982857","Cloud computing;Exponential smoothing prediction;Resource allocation","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Load management;Loading;Power demand;Resource management;Servers","cloud computing;network servers;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtualisation","ECRASP;cloud computing system;computer network fields;computing resources;energy conserving resource allocation scheme with prediction;independent servers;prediction based energy conserving resource allocation scheme;virtualization technique","","0","","10","","","22-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For computing grid composed of small local area network(LAN), this problem can be solved by properly building LAN with the use of IPv4 network or high-speed computing network such as Infiniband. However, when the computing resources are distributed in different physical regions, data transmission and communication will be affected by various factors such as time period and load. On the one hand, the stability of transmission cannot be guaranteed; On the other hand, the speed of cross-regional data transmission is not optimistic. As the next generation of Internet protocol, IPv6 is at a transitional stage, and the load is far less than the IPv4-based network. So, it has a better stability and higher bandwidth. With the help of IPv6 network, cross-regional computing grids can be constructed to connect the computing resources in different physical regions in order to deal with some complex computing problems.

It is not an easy task to transform the customer-oriented service metrics into operating level metrics, and control the Cloud resources adaptively based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the provider's revenue through SLA-based dynamic resource allocation as SLA plays a vital role in Cloud computing to bridge service providers and customers. We formalize the resource allocation problem using Queuing Theory and propose optimal solutions for the problem considering various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as pricing mechanisms, arrival rates, service rates and available resources.

Despite these enticing benefits and growing interest of exercising science cloud, there exist uncertainties and challenges that barricade the wide adoption of cloud computing in the scientific field. The goal of this paper is to identify the key consideration factors of adopting cloud computing for science and explore the interrelationship among them. We first developed a comprehensive hierarchy of consideration factors comprising four dimensions and ten underlying factors. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth survey and interview of 22 domain experts who were actively involved in constructing Taiwan national science clouds. The surveyed data was finally analyzed by employing Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to explore the influential network relationship of these consideration factors.

The cloud provides interesting high-performance computing solutions, with its promise of virtually infinite resources. However, migrating scientific computing problems to clouds and the re-creation of a software environment on the vendor-supplied OS and cloud instances is often a laborious task. It is also assumed that the scientist who is performing the experiments has significant knowledge of computer science, cloud computing and the migration procedure. Most often, this is not the case. Considering this obstacle, we have designed a tool that helps scientists to migrate their applications to the cloud. The idea is to migrate the complete software environment, in which the scientists have set up their experiments, directly to the cloud. The developed desktop-to-cloud-migration (D2CM) tool supports transformation and migration of virtual machine images, deployment description and life-cycle management for applications to be hosted on Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) or compatible infrastructure such as Eucalyptus. The paper also presents an electrochemical case study which extensively used the tool in drawing domain specific results. From the analysis, it was observed that D2CM tool not only helps in the migration process and simplifying the work of the scientist, but also helps in optimizing the calculations, compute clusters and thus the costs for conducting scientific computing experiments on the cloud.","","978-1-4799-0836-3","","10.1109/HPCSim.2013.6641389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641389","GPAW;VM migration;cloud computing;electrochemical experiments;scientific computing;supercapacitors","Capacitance;Cloud computing;Clouds;Computational modeling;Kernel;Supercapacitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;operating systems (computers);parallel processing;virtual machines","Amazon's elastic cloud computing;D2CM tool;EC2;cloud computing;cloud instances;computer science;deployment description;desktop-to-cloud-migration tool;high-performance computing solutions;life-cycle management;migration procedure;scientific computing experiments;software environment;vendor-supplied OS;virtual machine images","","0","","37","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model is particularly well suited for projects that have high popularity and little available computing infrastructure. The premise of volunteer computing platforms is the contribution of computing resources by individuals for little to no gain. It is therefore difficult to attract and retain contributors to projects. The Social Cloud for Volunteer Computing aims to exploit social engineering principles and the ubiquity of social networks to increase the outreach of volunteer computing, by providing an integrated volunteer computing application and creating gamification algorithms based on social principles to encourage contribution. In this paper we present the development of a production SoCVC, detailing the architecture, implementation and performance of the SoCVC Facebook application and show that the approach proposed could have a high impact on volunteer computing projects.","","978-1-4673-4467-8","","10.1109/eScience.2012.6404452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404452","","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Databases;Facebook;Feeds;Servers","cloud computing;social networking (online)","SoCVC Facebook application;gamification algorithms;integrated volunteer computing application;large scale scientific computing;social cloud;social engineering principles;social networks;volunteer computing platforms","","1","","17","","","8-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The non-deterministic characteristic of the resource availability in these new computing platforms raises an outstanding challenge: how to support quality of service (QoS) to meet a user's demand? In this study, we conduct a thorough study of QoS of distributed computing, especially on grid computing where the requirement of distributed sharing and coordination goes to the extreme. We start at QoS policies, and then focus on technical issues of the enforcement of the policies and performance optimization under each policy. This study provides a classification of existing software system based on their underlying policies, a systematic understanding of QoS, and a framework for QoS of grid computing.","","0-7695-2871-6","","10.1109/GCC.2007.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293807","","Availability;Communications technology;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Optimization;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Resource management;Web services","grid computing;quality of service","Web services;business-on-demand;distributed computing;distributed sharing;grid computing;network resources;peer-to-peer networks;quality of service;resource sharing","","2","","12","","","16-18 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ABI Research predicts that the number of mobile cloud computing subscribers is expected to grow from 42.8 million (1.1% of total mobile users) in 2008 to 998 million (19% of total mobile users) in 2014. Despite of this hype achieved by mobile cloud computing, the growth of mobile cloud computing subscribers is still below expectations. According to the recent survey conducted by the International Data Corporation, most IT Executives and CEOs are not interested in adopting such services due to the drawbacks associated with this (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), environment (e.g., heterogeneity, scalability, and availability), and security (e.g., reliability and privacy). In spite of various efforts to overcome these, there are a number of loopholes and challenges that still exist in the security policies of mobile cloud computing.

A more efficient use of the available resources will be mandatory. CMS is improving the data storage, distribution and access as well as the processing efficiency. Remote access to the data through the Wide Area Network, dynamic data replication and deletion based on the data access patterns, and separation of disk and tape storage are some of the areas being actively developed. Multi-core processing and scheduling is being pursued in order to make a better use of the multi-core nodes available at the sites. In addition, CMS is exploring new computing techniques, such as Cloud Computing, to get access to opportunistic resources, or as a means of using without interference dedicated computing resources, such as the high level trigger farm, while they are not utilized for their main purpose.

It is also a marriage between telecommunication and computing. Device manufacturers, content providers, network operators, service providers, and infrastructure providers need to collaborate their efforts to transform pervasive computing from knowledge into technology innovation. To businesses, pervasive computing offers mobile computing to business travelers, which increase employees' productivity, and additional marketing channel to reach potential customers. To consumers, pervasive computing offers mobile banking, from balance inquiry to fund transfer, directory assistance and maps, instant information exchange, news update, smart appliances, and much more. Through pervasive computing, businesses can personalize their customer service and marketing. However, there are significant challenges that companies have to overcome before they can realize the benefits of pervasive computing. The companies have to deal with translation from multiple wireless markup languages, integration of wireless network into existing wired network, limited bandwidth availability and data speed, data security, and customer acceptance from high-resolution image to LCD screen.

Organizations are shifting to the cloud rapidly in order to increase their overall benefits. Cloud computing has virtualization as its backbone. Cloud resources are provided on demand using the Internet and an on-running migration of resources is done by the cloud service provider. Failure is the nature of hardware and same for the software. Therefore, cloud resources can also fail at any time and leave impact on the performance of the other resources. That is why; it is required for cloud computing to incorporate a monitoring system. In a dynamic computing environment like cloud computing, it is hard to maintain and analyse the reliability of the resources. As cloud is a combination of different resources acting together to provide services to the end users, Virtual machines are the key to provide the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to these end users. In this paper a novel attempt is made to propose a reliability computing technique to calculate the reliability of a Cloud data centre. Further, in this paper we have proposed a mechanism for continuous updating of cloud resources' reliability and providing a reliable scheduling of the resources to the cloud users in a cloud computing environment.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030723","Cloud Computing;Cloudlet;Datacenter;Failure_Counter;Reliability;Virtual Machine","Cloud computing;Fault tolerance;Radiation detectors;Resource management;Software reliability;Virtual machining","cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;software reliability;system monitoring","IT world;IaaS;Internet;cloud computing environment;cloud computing reliability;cloud data centre;cloud resources reliability;cloud service provider;dynamic computing environment;infrastructure as a service;monitoring system;reliability as a service;reliability computing technique;reliable scheduling;resources performance;virtual machines;virtualization","","0","","","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Higher bandwidth of computer networks has further boosted development of cluster computing. Local and geographically dispersed deployment of computing resources is the most prominent differentiating issue between a cluster and grid computing based setups. Cluster necessarily requires deployment of multiple nodes at a single location connected via a high speed switch, while grid computing is based on access to remote computing resources, which may be a cluster. Integrating software with multi-layer integration has been the main thrust of research and development in the field of cluster and grid computing. In this paper a novel idea of building a virtual grid over a local area network, deploying resources by pooling has been suggested. The system uses one monitoring server to keep track of various parameters pertaining to the pooled resources and tasks deployed on the system. Software module for integrating the pooled resource has been developed and a prototype model of virtual computing grid using resource pooling (VCGuRP) has been deployed. The paper describes various design and implementation details of the system and also discusses performance issues and their evaluation.","","978-1-4244-3745-0","","10.1109/ICIT.2008.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731299","computing;grid monitoring;resource pooling;virtual computing grid","Application software;Bandwidth;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Grid computing;Local area networks;Network servers;Research and development;Software systems;Switches","grid computing;virtual reality;workstation clusters","cluster computing;computer networks;local area network;multilayer integration;remote computing resources;resource pooling;virtual computing grid","","2","","4","","","17-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of a strict hierarchy where decisions are pushed down, networked warfighters will cooperatively pursue the strategic goals of the commander in a much more decentralized fashion. Essential to the idea of Network Centric Warfare is the proliferation of ever-present information systems, or ubiquitous computing capabilities, where the computer (or rather, the networked computing capability) is no longer the focus of human attention, but rather, becomes invisible.

Currently, in heterogeneous computing, the scheduling method only for time optimization is quite mature, but the research on the executing method both for time and energy optimization is very few. This paper aims at the high performance computing and green computing, and pays more attention to the scheduling problem for a parallel task in heterogeneous computing environment.

First launched by the hardware/software co-design scene by adopting FPGAs for embedded system design, now a huge second wave has reached a wide variety of scientific computing communities. Google's yawdropping hit rates illustrate the pervasiveness of reconfigurable computing, now also being adopted by super computing (Cray, sgi, etc.). From FPGA usage as accelerators, speed-up factors by up to four orders of magnitude and more are reported, as well as floor space requirements and electricity invoice amounts reduced by one order of magnitude and more. This is astonishing, since FPGAs and rDPAs have a substantially lower clock speed than microprocessors and an effective integration density being lower by four orders of magnitude: the reconfigurable computing paradox. Algorithmic cleverness is the secret of success, based on software to configware migration mechanisms, striving away from memory-cycle-hungry instruction stream-based computing paradigms. Even higher speedup is achievable by using coarse-grained reconfigurable datapath arrays (rDPAs) available from a number of start-ups. With automatically partitioning configware/software cocompilers the desktop personal supercomputer is near. The main benefit of RC, having replaced the use of hardwired accelerators, is their flexibility by non-procedural programmability. This also contributes to more recent developments in system architecture, which rely on processes of evolution, self-organization, adaptation and fault tolerance. The main hurdles on the way to heart-stopping new horizons of cheap highest performance are CS-related educational deficits causing the configware/software chasm and a methodology fragmentation between the different cultures of application domains. Since the von Neumann paradigm is loosing its dominance by emerging reconfigurable main processors using hardwired von Neumann coprocessors as auxilia- - ry clerks, it is time for a curricular upgrade. Current CS curricula do not sufficiently meet their transdisciplinary responsibility. The talk gives a survey on fundamental issues in RC and on new directions in CS-related curricula, focused on a dual paradigm organic computing approach","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639429","","Clocks;Embedded software;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High performance computing;Layout;Microprocessors;Pervasive computing;Scientific computing","computer science education;educational courses;reconfigurable architectures","algorithmic cleverness;configware migration mechanism;desktop personal supercomputer;embedded system;field programmable gate array;nonprocedural programmability;organic computing;partitioning configware;reconfigurable computing paradox;reconfigurable datapath arrays;reconfigurable main processor;scientific computing;software cocompiler;super computing;very high performance computing","","0","","","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus far, much of this fields research has focused on extending services developed for desktop computing environments to mobile devices and managing the challenges that result from unreliable or varying network connectivity. In a recent column, the author discussed the unique challenges presented by adopting a much more personal model of mobile computing, rather than simply considering the impact of desktop applications and services (see ibid., April-June 1998, p. 8-10). In this column, he extends that discussion to consider arrays of deeply embedded computing devices that are not fundamentally associated with an individual person. Collectively, this model and associated technologies will serve for developing a set of fundamentally new systems called smart spaces. Smart spaces incorporate embedded computing devices with sensor technology to provide automatic responses to environmental changes.

A new model of computing called cloud computing is transforming computing to a model consisting of services that are treated as commodities and delivered in a manner like the traditional utilities. In this model, the services are accessed by the user based on their requirements without the knowledge of the place where these services are hosted or how these services are delivered. The data mining when offered in cloud computing environment allows e-commerce organizations a centralised management of software and data storage, with assurance of efficient, reliable and secure services for their users thus achieving maximized profit and cutting costs in different possible ways.

This is in contrast to the current practice of outright purchase or leasing of computing resources. When the cloud computing becomes popular, there will be multiple vendor offering different services at different Quality of Services and at different prices. The customers will need a scheme to select the right service provider based on their requirements. A trust management system will match the service providers and the customers based on the requirements and offerings. In this paper, the authors propose a trust formulation and evolution mechanism that can be used to measure the performance of cloud systems. The proposed mechanism formulates trust scores for different service level requirements, hence is suitable for managing multiple service levels against single trust score. Also the proposed mechanism is an adaptive one that takes the dynamics of performance variation along with cloud attributes such as number of virtual servers into computations. Finally the proposed mechanism has been tested under a simulated environment and the results have been presented.","","978-1-4577-1935-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144204","Cloud Computing;Quality of Service;Trust Evolution;Trust Formulation","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Hardware;Operating systems;Quality of service;Time factors","cloud computing;trusted computing","applications;cloud attributes;cloud computing;computing power;computing resources;development platform;evolution mechanism;prices;quality of services;service level requirements;service provider;storage;trust computing mechanism;trust formulation;trust management system;trust scores;virtual servers","","0","","40","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we propose a simulation tool that supports the MapReduce model, the most widely used programming model for big data processing, implemented on CloudSim, an open source simulator for cloud computing and datacenters.","","978-1-4673-4829-4","978-1-4673-4827-0","10.1109/ICTC.2012.6387186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387186","Cloud Computing;MapReduce;Performance Evaluation","","cloud computing;computer centres;parallel processing","CloudSim simulator;ICP;ISP;Internet content provider;Internet service provider;MR-CloudSim framework;MapReduce computing model;cloud Web storage;cloud computing;cloud network;cloud service;cloud system;cloud-based Web application;computing facility;computing resource;data center;data processing;mobile computing;open source simulator","","3","","6","","","15-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users can access and manipulate data from anywhere at anytime using a dynamic range of computing devices as they move across different environments. Today's ""computer-centric"" paradigm however puts increasing demand on user attention impacting overall efficiency. Today, typically a user has to manually figure out the available resources and appreciate the constraints of the new computing environment in order to continue performing his computing tasks in a new device, as he moves across computing devices. This results in the user spending considerable amount dealing with the different nuances of different computing environments and remembering the different contexts and ensuring that all data is in sync as he works on a single task but using different devices and different times. In this paper, we describe Nimbus, an enterprise grade platform we have developed and deployed aimed at providing true anytime anywhere computing, realized by an end to end system designed around the ""tasks that the user performs"" rather than computing devices the user uses","","0-7695-2560-1","","10.1109/SEUS-WCCIA.2006.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611708","","Cities and towns;Collaborative software;Conferences;Context awareness;Dynamic range;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Productivity;Roads;Software engineering","mobile computing","Nimbus;context aware mobile computing;enterprise grade platform;pervasive computing;task aware mobile computing","","0","","8","","","27-28 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a novel branch of computational intelligence, DNA computing has the strong computing and matching capability to discriminate the tiny differences in DNA strands by DNA encoding and matching in the molecule layer. Similar to DNA discrimination, a hyperspectral remote sensing data matching approach is used to recognize the land cover material from a spectral library or image, according to the rich spectral information. However, it is difficult to apply DNA computing to hyperspectral remote sensing data processing because traditional DNA computing often relies on biochemical reactions of DNA molecules and may result in incorrect or undesirable computations. To utilize the advantages and avoid the problems of biological DNA computing, an artificial DNA computing approach is proposed for spectral encoding and matching for hyperspectral remote sensing data. A DNA computing-based spectral matching approach is used to first transform spectral signatures into DNA codewords by capturing the key spectral features with a spectral feature encoding operation. After DNA encoding, the typical DNA database for interesting classes is constructed and saved by DNA evolutionary operating mechanisms such as crossover, mutation, and structured mutation. During the course of spectral matching, each pixel of the hyperspectral image, or each signature measured in the field, is input to the constructed DNA database. By computing the distance between an unclassified spectrum and the typical DNA codewords from the database, the class property of each pixel is set as the minimum distance class. Experiments using different hyperspectral data sets were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed artificial DNA computing-based spectral matching algorithm by comp- ring it with other traditional hyperspectral classifiers, including spectral matching classifiers (binary coding, spectral angle mapper and spectral derivative feature coding (SDFC) matching methods) and a novel statistical method of machine learning termed support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is distinctly superior to the three traditional hyperspectral data classification algorithms. It presents excellent processing efficiency, compared to SVM, with high-dimensional data captured by the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment sensor, and hence provides an effective option for spectral matching classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2188856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178011","Classification;deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) computation;hyperspectral remote sensing;spectral matching","Biological information theory;DNA;DNA computing;Encoding;Hyperspectral imaging","biocomputing;geophysical image processing;image matching;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;statistical analysis;support vector machines","DNA encoding;DNA strands;SVM;artificial DNA computing approach;artificial DNA computing-based spectral encoding;biological deoxyribonucleic acid computing;computational intelligence;constructed DNA database;hyperspectral data sets;hyperspectral remote sensing data;land cover material;machine learning;matching algorithm;matching capability;spectral information;spectral signature classification;statistical method;structured mutation;support vector machine","","4","","47","","2012-04-04","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since peers are not dedicated to a system, peers are free to leave and join autonomously during computation in this computing environment. A scheduling mechanism must cover the volatility of peers to support a reliable P2P grid computing system. Most existing P2P grid computing systems, however, suffer from blocked job execution and delayed makespan because they do not consider the volatile features of peers in the scheduling procedure. In order to improve system reliability, we propose a probabilistic observation prediction (POP) -based EA scheduling mechanism supporting three advanced scheduling policies: loose time constraint policy (LTCP), strict time constraint policy (STCP), and hybrid time constraint policy (HTCP). LTCP is for general use, STCP aims at minimizing makespan, and HTCP attempts to improve efficiency, and performance-to-cost ratio.

But on the one hand, currently widely used open source virtualized environment managers can not meet the requirement of private cloud especially small scale private cloud due to their overstaffed functionality and complexity, on the other hand, customized commercial managers always involve a significant mount of fees and it is hard to be integrated by other applications running in the cloud. Based on the deep investigation on virtualization technique especially on Xen, the design and implement of a light-weighted integrated virtualized environment manager (LWIV Manager) is presented in this paper. LWIV Manager provides an easy use and integration way to allocate the computing resources of CPU, memory and network in the cloud.

As more complex grid applications make use of work flows in their design and deployment it is reasonable to consider the impact of work flow deployment over a volunteer computing infrastructure. In this case, the inter work flow I/O can lead to a significant increase in I/O demands at the work pool server. A possible solution is the use of a peer-to-peer based parallel computing architecture to off-load this I/O demand to the workers; where the workers can fulfill some aspects of work flow coordination and I/O checking, etc. However, achieving robustness in such a large scale system is a challenging hurdle towards the decentralized execution of work flows and general parallel processes. To increase robustness, we propose and show the merits of using an adaptive checkpoint scheme that efficiently checkpoints the status of the parallel processes according to the estimation of relevant network and peer parameters. Based on our proposed mathematical checkpoint model, our scheme uses statistical data observed during runtime to dynamically make checkpoint decisions in a completely decentralized manner. The results of simulation show support for our proposed approach in terms of reduced required runtime.","","978-0-7695-3443-5","","10.1109/PDCAT.2008.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4710985","","Checkpointing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Grid computing;Large-scale systems;Parallel processing;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Runtime","checkpointing;grid computing;parallel processing;peer-to-peer computing;software architecture","adaptive checkpointing;grid applications;parallel computing architecture;parallel processing;peer-to-peer computing;public resource computing;volunteer computing work flows;work pool server","","1","","23","","","1-4 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper first investigates when questions are raised about “social computing.” We find that the oldest Wikipedia article on social computing was written on January 21, 2005. However, it is found that a major rewrite was done on October 17, 2007, which caused a great change in its definition. It seems that the reason for this change is the idea of collective intelligence that has been popularized in James Surowiecki's book, The Wisdom of Crowds. In order to examine how the concept of social computing is accepted by and has infiltrated the web society, we performed an analysis of the search engine results page (SERF) using Google, specifying the search keyword as “social computing.” This paper investigates a formal model of social computing, which is described in contrast with the traditional computing scheme. Based on this model, we investigate the relationship between social computing and computer science, and we conclude that the Wikipedia article on social computing that states “social computing is a general term for an area of computer science ...” is inaccurate.","","978-1-4799-0234-7","","10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542456","Google;Wikipedia;collective intelligence;computer science;definition of social computing;formal model of social computing;information-intensive society;social computing;the wisdom of crowd;web 2.0;web society","","Web sites;data analysis;search engines;social networking (online)","Google;SERF;Web society;Wikipedia article;collective intelligence;computer science;search engine results page analysis;search keyword;social computing","","0","","","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud computing system coordinates infrastructure subsystems to provide services to users. Most current cloud computing systems lacks pluggability in their infrastructure subsystems and decision algorithms, which restricts the development of infrastructure subsystems and decision algorithms in cloud computing system. A cloud computing system should have the flexibility to switch from one infrastructure subsystem to another, and one decision algorithm to another with ease. This paper describes Roystonea, a hierarchical distributed cloud computing system with plug gable component architecture. The component pluggability ability gives administrators the flexibility to use the most appropriate subsystem as they wish. The component pluggability of Roystonea is based on a specifically designed interfaces among Roystonea controlling system and infrastructure subsystems components. The component pluggability also encourages the development of infrastructure subsystems in cloud computing. Roystonea provides a test bed for designing decision algorithms used in cloud computing system. The decision algorithms are totally isolated from other components in Roystonea architecture, so the designers of the decision algorithms can focus on algorithm design without worrying about how his algorithm will interact with other Roystonea components.

It is envisioned that, in the near future, cloud computing will have a significant impact on the educational and learning environment, enabling their own users (i.e., learners, instructors, and administrators) to perform their tasks effectively with less cost by utilizing the available cloud-based applications offered by the cloud service providers. This paper discusses the use of cloud computing in the educational and learning arena, to be called “Education and Learning as a Service” (ELaaS), emphasizing its possible benefits and offerings. It is essential for an educational and learning organization, with its budget restrictions and sustainability challenges, to use the cloud formation best suited for a particular IT activity. The Jericho Forum proposes a cloud computing formation model, called the Cloud Cube Model (CCM), which is based on 4 criteria. To preserve the symmetry of the cube, a new cloud computing formation model, called the Complete Cloud Computing Formations (C<sup>3</sup>F), is proposed. The IT activities in the educational and learning organizations are then classified with respect to the two criteria: mission criticality and sensitivity. Each class is then mapped into the appropriate position in the C<sup>3</sup>F, creating ELaaS Quadrant. This essentially establishes a general conceptual framework for ELaaS.","","978-1-4577-1748-2","","10.1109/ICL.2011.6059655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059655","Cloud Computing;Cloud Computing Formations;Education and Learning as a Service (ELaaS);Grid Computing;Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Education;Utility Computing;Virtualization;Web Services","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Conferences;Educational institutions;Organizations","cloud computing;computer aided instruction","IT activities;cloud computing formation model;cloud cube model;complete cloud computing formation;education and learning as a service;educational organizations;learning organizations;mission criticality;mission sensitivity;virtualized resource","","7","","22","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS). Aneka, an enterprise cloud computing solution, harnesses the power of compute resources by relying on private and public clouds and delivers to users the desired QoS. Its flexible and service based infrastructure supports multiple programming paradigms that make Aneka address a variety of different scenarios: from finance applications to computational science.

Recently, cloud computing become more attractive, as cluster computing is one of the core basements of cloud computing. However, the development of cluster-based system is hard without relative knowledge such as networking, workload distribution, fault tolerant, etc. Thus, various implementations for cluster computing have been introduced to help the development of cluster-based system. However, these implementations also have the limitation for developing cluster-based system because of high performance in specified application fields. In this paper, we present the SCAREX framework which supports scalability, reliability, extendibility, and easy for implementing cluster-based system. This framework employs a fault-tolerant mechanism for the failure of workload processing, and facilitates dynamic module distribution and loading for the work module which works on the worker node. The SCAREX also provides a simple programming interface for easy development. Since the SCAREX has flexible architecture, the developer can implement various cluster architecture and extend cluster architecture by combining the SCAREX-based cluster with other packages of the SCAREX or other frameworks.","","978-1-4244-8567-3","978-89-88678-30-5","10.1109/ICCIT.2010.5711200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5711200","Cluster Computing;Cluster Computing Framework;Distributed Computing;Middleware;Programmable Cluster Framework","Computer architecture;Computer integrated manufacturing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Logic gates;Monitoring","cloud computing;computer network reliability;fault tolerant computing;workstation clusters","SCAREX framework;SCAREX-based cluster;cloud computing;cluster architecture;cluster-based system;dynamic module distribution;extendable cluster computing;extendibility;fault tolerant;fault-tolerant mechanism;networking;programming interface;reliability;reliable cluster computing;scalability;scalable cluster computing;workload distribution;workload processing","","1","","31","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A community engagement partnership of the Blue Waters Petascale Computing Facility at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and Shodor, the BWSIP has developed, demonstrated, and evaluated novel lessons involving hands-on, interactive, and collaborative methodologies to teach parallel and distributed computing (PDC) and high-performance computing (HPC) topics. Students participating in the program gain experience in the application of highperformance computing to real-world problems in science, mathematics, and engineering through a year-long internship. By engaging undergraduate and graduate students in Petascale computing research and development projects, students build confidence and competence in PDC and HPC.The BWSIP recruited a large and diverse applicant pool from across the US from which 21 research interns reflecting that diversity were selected and each matched with a mentor and a project for the year-long internship. Students, many having only introductory programming experience, began their internship by attending the two-week Petascale Institute -- each day including 6.5 hours of directed, inquiry-based learning and 2 hours of open lab using the run-modify-write paradigm -- during which they were trained in PDC and HPC tools, techniques, and technologies using Blue Waters at NCSA, and by analogy other XSEDE HPC resources. Students then continued working all summer on their home campuses, or were hosted by their mentor, with on-going work expected to be continued during both Fall and Spring semesters.The project engaged an external evaluator to conduct formative and summative assessments of the program. BWSIP Interns participated in pre- and post-surveys, daily reflections/evaluation questions, as well as in a focus group during the- r training. Even with significant differences in background, knowledge, and with varying projects, participants stated that the two-week institute was an essential element to help them learn conceptual thinking and how to program using parallel computing.

In order to facilitate bioinformatics research, we have designed and implemented a distributed and parallel computing environment with grid technology, in which, biologists can solve bioinformatics problems using distributed computing resources in parallel and reduce execution time. In this environment, the computing power and program information of computing nodes are described with XML documents. A web service named Local Resource Management Service is deployed on each computing node so that the distributed resources can be accessed in a uniform manner. With an API suite, biologists can use distributed computing resources in parallel easily in their applications. Further more, users can monitor the status of distributed resources dynamically on the portal. A real use case of alternative splicing is also presented, through which we have analyzed the usability, efficiency, and stability of the environment.","","0-7695-2871-6","","10.1109/GCC.2007.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293834","","Bioinformatics;Biology computing;Data analysis;Distributed computing;Parallel processing;Proteins;Resource management;Splicing;Web services;XML","Web services;XML;application program interfaces;biology computing;grid computing;parallel programming","API suite;Web service;XML documents;alternative splicing;bioinformatics research;distributed parallel computing;grid technology;local resource management service","","1","","21","","","16-18 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moving away from traditional data-center oriented models, distributed clouds extend over a loosely coupled federated substrate, offering enhanced communication and computational services to target end-users with quality of service (QoS) requirements, as dictated by the future Internet vision. Toward facilitating the efficient realization of such networked computing environments, computing and networking resources need to be jointly treated and optimized. This requires delivery of user-driven sets of virtual resources, dynamically allocated to actual substrate resources within networked clouds, creating the need to revisit resource mapping algorithms and tailor them to a composite virtual resource mapping problem. In this paper, toward providing a unified resource allocation framework for networked clouds, we first formulate the optimal networked cloud mapping problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, indicating objectives related to cost efficiency of the resource mapping procedure, while abiding by user requests for QoS-aware virtual resources. We subsequently propose a method for the efficient mapping of resource requests onto a shared substrate interconnecting various islands of computing resources, and adopt a heuristic methodology to address the problem. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated in a simulation/emulation environment, that allows for a flexible, structured, and comparative performance evaluation. We conclude by outlining a proof-of-concept realization of our proposed schema, mounted over the European future Internet test-bed FEDERICA, a resource virtualization platform augmented with network and computing facilities.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2013.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6463381","Federated infrastructures;cloud computing;quality of service;resource allocation;resource mapping;virtualization","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Resource management;Virtualization","cloud computing;integer programming;quality of service;resource allocation;virtualisation","FEDERICA platform;MIP problem;QoS requirement;cloud computing network;composite virtual resource mapping problem;computing resource;computing resource usage;data-center oriented model;demand service;distributed computing;future Internet vision;heuristic methodology;mixed integer programming;networking resource;optimal virtual resource allocation;quality of service requirement;resource scalability;resource virtualization platform;substrate resource","","14","","39","","2013-02-15","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We provide a nested two stage game formulation for the MCC interaction system. In the first stage, each mobile device determines the portion of its service requests for remote processing in the cloud. In the second stage, the cloud computing facilities allocate a portion of its total resources for service request processing depending on the request arrival rate from all the mobile devices. The objective of each mobile device is to minimize its power consumption as well as the service request response time. The objective of the cloud computing controller is to maximize its own profit. Based on the backward induction principle, we derive the optimal or near-optimal strategy for all the mobile devices as well as the cloud computing controller in the nested two stage game using convex optimization technique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nested two stage game-based optimization framework on the MCC interaction system. The mobile devices can achieve simultaneous reduction in average power consumption and average service request response time, by 21.8% and 31.9%, respectively, compared with baseline methods.","","978-1-4673-5659-6","","10.1109/SOSE.2013.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525567","game theory;mobile cloud computing;mobile devices;nested game;resource allocation","Cloud computing;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Optimization;Power demand;Servers","cloud computing;convex programming;energy conservation;game theory;mobile computing;power aware computing;power consumption;profitability","MCC interaction system;average power consumption;average service request response time;backward induction principle;cloud computing controller;cloud computing facilities;convex optimization technique;mobile cloud computing system;mobile devices;near-optimal strategy;nested two stage game-based optimization framework;power consumption minimization;profit maximization;remote processing;request arrival rate;service request processing;service request response time minimization","","4","","33","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Parallel and Distributed Computing: Memories of Time Past and a Glimpse at the Future","Marinescu, D.C.","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA","Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC), 2014 IEEE 13th International Symposium on","20140918","2014","","","14","15","We propose to look at the evolution of ideas related to parallel systems, algorithms, and applications during the past three decades and then glimpse at the future. The journey starts with massively parallel systems of the early nineties, transitions gently to computing for the masses on the clouds of the first decade of the new millennium, and continues with what we could expect from quantum computers and quantum parallelism in the next few decades. In the late 1980s several technology companies were tasked to build massively parallel systems for classified and unclassified work. Supercomputers built with high-performance processors and low-latency interconnection networks provided the computing cycles for a relatively small population of sophisticated users from National Laboratories and universities. For example, the Touchstone Delta and then the Paragon had a hypercube interconnection network connecting together hundreds or thousands i860s, RISC processors launched with great fanfare by Intel, but mostly forgotten today. Virtually all un-classified applications running on such systems required the development of parallel libraries and parallel algorithms for different areas of scientific computing. Well discuss in some depth an application in the area of structural biology we developed for the Touchstone Delta, the 3D structure determination of viruses with unknown symmetry at high resolution. The tide turned, and in the second half of the first decade of the new millennium utility computing captured the attention of the masses. Large farms of servers built with off-the-shelf components, the so-called clouds, appeared in different time zones on earth, rather than the sky, to support enterprize computing. Anybody with a credit card and a problem involving big data now had access to vast amounts of computing cycles and storage space. The number of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), the spectrum of services offered by the CSPs, and the number of cloud users have incr- ased dramatically during the last few years. For example, in 2007 the EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) was the first service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services), five years later, in 2012, AWS was used by businesses in 200 countries. Amazons S3 (Simple Storage Service) has surpassed two trillion objects and routinely runs more than 1.1 million peak requests per second. Well-known methods to partition the data and process the data concurrently were rediscovered and given new names, the Elastic MapReduce service has launched 5.5 million clusters since the start of the service in May 2010. In our presentation well concentrate on the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud delivery model, discuss several classes of applications running successfully on a cloud, and present the results of some cloud benchmarks. While the computer science and computer engineering communities were busy developing operating systems, file systems, compilers, and algorithms for parallel systems a physicist, albeit a very famous one, Richard Feynman, showed in 1982 that computers obeying the laws of classical physics will never be able to carry out some difficult tasks, for example, to exactly simulate a quantum system. He predicted that a system where information is encoded as properties of quantum particles and processed using reversible state transformations will be capable of delivering extraordinary computing power. A number of alternatives for building a quantum computer including quantum dots based on spin or charge, trapped ions in a cavity, liquid NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), quantum Hall effect, and other physical processes are now investigated in many labs around the world. The race to build a quantum computer is on. To understand why, we overview the physical phenomena exploited by quantum parallelism and then discuss Shors factoring algorithm which achieves an exponential speed-up compared with a classical one. In 2009 it took almost two years and hundreds of computers to fac","","978-1-4799-5918-1","","10.1109/ISPDC.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900194","","Cloud computing;Computer science;Computers;Educational institutions;Quantum computing;Quantum dots","distributed processing;multiprocessing systems","AWS;Amazon Web services;Amazons S3;CSP;EC2;Elastic MapReduce service;Elastic cloud computing;IaaS cloud delivery model;Intel;Paragon;RISC processors;Touchstone Delta;cloud service providers;distributed computing;high-performance processors;hypercube interconnection network;infrastructure-as-a-service;low-latency interconnection networks;massively parallel systems;parallel algorithms;parallel applications;parallel computing;parallel libraries;parallel systems;quantum computers;quantum parallelism;reduced instrucion set computers;simple storage service;supercomputers","","0","","","","","24-27 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sixth IEEE International Symposium on","20030521","2003","","","172","179","Devices in ubiquitous computing environments are usually embedded, wearable, and handheld, have resource constraints, and are all connected to each other through wireless connections and other computers possibly through fixed network infrastructures, such as the Internet. These devices may form numerous webs of short-range and often low-power mobile ad hoc networks to exchange information. Distributed object computing (DOC) middleware technologies have been successful in promoting high quality and reusable distributed software for enterprise-oriented environments. In order to reap the same benefit in ubiquitous computing environments, it is important to note that the natural interactions among distributed objects in ubiquitous computing environments are quite different due to various factors, such as bandwidth constraints, unpredictable device mobility, network topology change, and context-sensitivity (or situation-awareness) of application objects. Hence, the interactions among distributed objects tend to be more spontaneous and short-lived rather than predictable and long-term. In this paper, a middleware protocol, RKF, to facilitate distributed object-based application software to interact in an ad hoc fashion in ubiquitous computing environments is presented. RKF addresses both spontaneous object discovery and context-sensitive object data exchange. Our experimental results, based on RKF's implementation and evaluation inside the object request broker of our RCSM middleware test bed, indicate that it is lightweight, has good performance, and can be easily used in PDA-like devices.","","0-7695-1928-8","","10.1109/ISORC.2003.1199252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199252","","Application software;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Embedded computing;Handheld computers;Middleware;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Ubiquitous computing;Wearable computers","Internet;ad hoc networks;distributed object management;middleware;protocols;ubiquitous computing","Internet;context-sensitive object data exchange;distributed object computing;enterprise-oriented environment;lightweight middleware protocol;mobile ad hoc networks;situation-awareness;ubiquitous computing environment;unpredictable device mobility","","1","","","","","14-16 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their limitation, however, is that they only support simple resource sharing such as file (storage) sharing and bandwidth sharing. On the other hand, based on virtualization techniques, cloud computing provides a more flexible mechanism to share all types of resources with no limitations. Nevertheless, the use of cloud computing usually requires a fee and is often locked-in to services of cloud computing providers (i.e., vendor lock-in). In this paper, we aim to combine P2P and cloud computing technologies to design and develop PC<sup>2</sup>, an open and free cloud computing platform that allows users to participate in any time to contribute as well as to consume sharing resources. While this combination inherits good advantages of these two technologies, it also avoid their disadvantages.

Development of technologies that facilitate sharing geospatial model becomes highly desirable. Although geospatial infrastructures built using standards-based distributed services have become the default computing paradigm adopted, most of them have been built following a top-down approach that only official providers are entitled to deploy and preserve geospatial resources including geospatial models. Since the mechanisms to deploy geospatial model as a web service in geospatial infrastructures are technologically complex, there has been limited participation from users, resulting in a scarcity of sharing geospatial model resources. Furthermore, the poor efficiency of geospatial model online implement remains the pains in most of geospatial infrastructures for transmitting and computing geodata in standard OGC service. Nowadays, the development of Cloud computing including associated spatial computing becomes the promising technology which is essential for enabling computing-intensive and data-intensive geospatial research and applications. Citizen sensing activities are accumulating data, information and models at a comparable or faster pace. To utilize these emerging technologies for addressing the limitations mentioned above, we present a distributed framework based on OGC specification and extend it with a service deploy component. This component improves ad hoc integration, deployment and register of geospatial model resources by two distinguishing approaches. Geospatial models can then be deployed, shared and accessed through tools and systems compliant with WPS by end users. Moreover, we modified the interface specification of WPS and WFS conforming to the MapReduce parallel computing mode and designed a self-adaptive task regulating mechanism for Hadoop and achieved great acceleration of the data-intensive computing in geospatial model.

Using the available Internet connectivity, the carriers could offer services like Video-on-Demand (VoD), Voice-over-IP (VoIP), and gaming-on-demand within the aircraft. One of the major road blocks in implementing any of these services is the additional hardware and software requirements. Each service requires dedicated hardware resources to run appropriate software components. It is not possible to accommodate every hardware component within the aircraft due to space, power, and ventilation restrictions. Also, it is economically not viable to install and maintain hardware components for every aircraft. One solution is to use cloud computing. Cloud computing is a recent innovation that is helping the computing industry in distributed computing. Cloud computing allows the organizations to consolidate several hardware resources into one physical device. The Cloud computing concept helps organizations in reducing the overall power consumption and maintenance costs. The cloud computing concept could be extended to the Aircraft Data Network environment with every aircraft subscribing to the cloud resources to run their non mission-critical applications. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of using cloud services for Aircraft Data Networks. The authors evaluate the performance issues involved with the aircraft mobility and dynamic resource transfer between servers when the aircraft's point-of-attachment changes. The authors predict that using cloud computing concepts would encourage many carriers to offer new services within the aircraft.","2155-4943","978-1-4577-0593-9","","10.1109/ICNSURV.2011.5935273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935273","","Aircraft;Cloud computing;Hardware;Protocols;Servers;Software;Virtual machining","aircraft communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication computing","Internet connectivity;VoD;VoIP;aircraft data network;aircraft mobility;cloud computing;distributed computing;dynamic resource transfer;gaming-on-demand;hardware resources;maintenance cost;power consumption;video-on-demand;voice-over-IP","","2","","21","","","10-12 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low cost, high volume sensor nodes are realizable due to a high level of chip integration (i.e. system-on-a-chip). These sensor nodes can operate more efficiently in a distributed environment using cognitive reasoning for making collaborative decisions, improving the quality of information and realtime sensing control. Fabric computing (FC) provides the flexible connectivity of these sensor nodes that can adapt in real time to service dynamic application needs. One underlying technology for FC is the field programmable gate array (FPGA) reconfigurable technology. FC easily integrates other key devices to provide a distributed computing fabric that offers computing at the edge of the network (near the users or sensors). The ultimate goal of providing real-time sensing using FC is to provide distributed services and processing near the sensors, referred to as ""power to the edge."" In this paper we evaluate general trends for intelligent computing on the edge of the network using reconfigurable computing fabric formed as cells that can scale from global network to chips.

As opposed to traditional computing systems, however, large-scale testing of pervasive computing systems requires the presence of dozens (perhaps hundreds) of physical devices, arranged together in a network, executing a variety of complex scenarios. In order to reduce the cost of such testing, it would be better to simulate the operation of a pervasive computing system using well-known techniques from multi-agent simulation, by representing each (hardware or software) component of the system as a software agent. In this paper we describe our ongoing work, where we extend our earlier work on multi-agent simulation, for pervasive computing systems.

The enthusiasm for cloud infrastructures is not only present in the business world, but also extends to government agencies. Managers of both segments thus need to have a clear view of how this new era will evolve in the coming years, in order to appropriately react to a changing economic and technological environment. In this study, we explore the dynamic equilibrium of cloud computing adoption through the application of Mean Field Games. In our formulation, each agent (i.e., each firm or government agency) arbitrates between “continuing to implement the traditional on-site computing paradigm” and “moving to adopt the cloud computing paradigm”. To decide on his level of moving to the cloud computing paradigm, each agent will optimize a total cost that consists of two components: the effort cost of moving to the cloud computing paradigm and the adoption cost of implementing the cloud computing paradigm. In the formulation, the adoption cost is linked to the general trend of decisions on the computing paradigm adoption. Thus, an agent's optimal level of transition to the cloud computing paradigm is not only dependent on his own effort and adoption costs but also affected by the general trend of adoption decisions. The problem is solved by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), that is, mean field games PDEs, which consists of a backward PDE, the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation for a controlled problem, and a forward Fokker-Planck equation transported by the optimal control from the backward HJB equation. Thus, the solution to the forward Fokker-Planck equation enables us to study the dynamic evolution of the density of the cloud computing adoption. It therefore allows us to investigate the impact of the general trend of technology adoption decisions on a firm's optimal decision of technology transition.","","978-1-4673-4537-8","","10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483221","","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Economics;Equations;Games;Market research;Mathematical model","Fokker-Planck equation;client-server systems;cloud computing;commerce;economics;government;partial differential equations","Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation;backward PDE;business world;client/server;cloud computing adoption;cloud infrastructures;dynamic equilibrium;economic;forward Fokker-Planck equation;government agencies;mean field games;technological environment","","0","","6","","","1-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the hybrid crossover and incremental mutation operations within the algorithm can move the solution away from the local-optimal solution towards a near-optimal solution.

Usually, these services put a huge amount of effort into geometry data computation. Thus, their workload is generally high. By exploring cloud computing techniques, one could utilize a number of computing nodes to distribute the workload of the systems. However, the workload is usually not equally balanced across computing nodes, if data is not well distributed. To make the best use of computing nodes, we propose a sophisticated data distribution technology for geometry computation processing. Intuitively, one can simply divide geometry data into tiles so that the geometry data in each tile can be stored on one computing node. Unfortunately, since data in a tile shares spatial-proximity, processing a geometry computation on spatial proximity data still incurs a huge workload. To address this issue, we propose a new data distribution approach, Reversed K-means, to distribute geometry data that shares spatial-proximity across different computing nodes. In this way, we can use more computing nodes to process geometry computation and get better performance. To evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate the utility of computing nodes and the response time when performing geometry computations.

Mobile cloud computing is generally applied to augment such capabilities of mobile devices, but has been limited to the interaction between the back-end cloud infrastructure, which availability, however, could be limited due to the dynamic network characteristics at the tactical edge. In this paper, we develop a novel theoretical framework to exploit the potential of peer mobile devices on mobile cloud computing, when they opportunistically move into the communication range of each other. Our proposed framework aims to adaptively configure the computational workload allocations among mobile devices, by considering both the energy consumption and timeliness of computational task execution. Probabilistic methods are adopted to quantitatively estimate the opportunistic network transmission delay and ensure that the computational results could be delivered back to the task initiator on time. Extensive trace-driven simulation results show that our proposed framework could significantly improve the mobile cloud computing performance, while reducing the energy consumption of such computing, compared to the existing schemes.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956986","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Mobile handsets;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing","cloud computing;energy consumption;military communication;military computing;mobile computing;mobile handsets;peer-to-peer computing;probability;synchronisation;telecommunication power management","back-end cloud infrastructure;computational task execution;computational workload allocations;energy consumption;hand-held mobile devices;in-situ sensory data;mobile computing capabilities;network transmission delay;peer mobile devices;peer-to-peer mobile cloud computing;probabilistic methods;tactical edge","","0","","35","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It shares common requirements with its predecessor, like context awareness, user centricity, composability and dynamicity. However, a challenging issue of urban computing is to provide available services to diverse, spontaneous social groups. A major requirement for this challenge is spontaneity, which is about supporting social groups by coordinating available services during runtime, without having a previous definition of applications into templates or other predefined descriptions. The approach of task oriented computing realizes these requirements. It is about representing users' goals in tasks. A task is composed of unit-tasks (basic configurations of abstract services), which are selected based on `placeness'. Placeness consists of the aspects that characterize urban environments and social groups: spatial, temporal, social and personal aspects. The focus of this paper is twofold: first, to provide a semantically-based unit-task description model; second, to propose a unit-task selection algorithm based on placeness on top of the model. The appropriateness of the task selection algorithm is illustrated by a demostration scenario in our campus.","","978-1-4244-6605-4","978-1-4244-6606-1","10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470673","Spontaneous Users Interaction;Task-oriented Computing;Ubiquitous Computing;Urban Computing","Bridges;Computer science;Context awareness;Mediation;Pervasive computing;Runtime;Ubiquitous computing","task analysis;ubiquitous computing","context awareness;semantically-based unit-task description model;social groups;spontaneous interactions;task-oriented approach;ubiquitous computing;unit-task selection algorithm;urban computing environments;user centricity","","1","","21","","","March 29 2010-April 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a ""catch-up"" mode to identify policy, governance, and law.

In the core of such a non-uniform environment, facilitating interoperability, portability, and integration among heterogeneous platforms is nontrivial. Building such facilitators in MCC requires investigations to understand heterogeneity and its challenges over the roots. Although there are many research studies in mobile computing and cloud computing, convergence of these two areas grants further academic efforts towards flourishing MCC. In this paper, we define MCC, explain its major challenges, discuss heterogeneity in convergent computing (i.e. mobile computing and cloud computing) and networking (wired and wireless networks), and divide it into two dimensions, namely vertical and horizontal. Heterogeneity roots are analyzed and taxonomized as hardware, platform, feature, API, and network. Multidimensional heterogeneity in MCC results in application and code fragmentation problems that impede development of cross-platform mobile applications which is mathematically described. The impacts of heterogeneity in MCC are investigated, related opportunities and challenges are identified, and predominant heterogeneity handling approaches like virtualization, middleware, and service oriented architecture (SOA) are discussed.

The current mainstream cloud computing service providers have adopted Hadoop, the open source MapReduce implementation, to build their cloud computing platform. However, like all open distributed computing frameworks, MapReduce suffers from the service integrity assurance vulnerability: it takes merely one malicious worker to render the overall computation result useless. It is very important to efficiently detect the malicious workers in cloud computing environment. Existing solutions are not effective enough in defeating the malicious behaviour of non-collusive and collusive workers. In this paper, we focus on the mappers, which typically constitute the majority of workers. On the basis of the existing frameworks, we make the master manage the computing workers based on the security levels, and introduce the trusted verifier worker and caching mechanism. According to the system analysis, the service integrity assurance framework suggested in this paper is more efficient and accurate to detect the malicious workers in the cloud computing environment based on MapReduce.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664404","Cloud computing;Malicious workers;MapReduce;Service integrity","Accuracy;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data models;Data processing;History;Security","cloud computing;security of data","Hadoop;cloud computing;open distributed computing frameworks;open source MapReduce implementation;parallel large data sets;service integrity assurance framework","","0","","9","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing resource management systems in data centers are yet to support Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation, and thus need to be enhanced to realize cloud computing and utility computing. In addition, no work has been done to collectively incorporate customer-driven service management, computational risk management, and autonomic resource management into a market-based resource management system to target the rapidly changing enterprise requirements of Cloud computing. This paper presents vision, challenges, and architectural elements of SLA-oriented resource management.

An important component of utility computing is storage, data volumes are growing rapidly, and mechanisms to mitigate this growth need to be developed. Data deduplication is a promising technique for drastically reducing the amount of data stored in such system systems, however, current approachs are static in nature, using an amount of redundancy fixed at design time. This is inappropriate for truly dynamic modern systems. We propose a real-time adaptive deduplication system for Cloud and Utility computing that monitors in real-time for changing system, user, and environmental behaviour in order to fulfill a balance between changing storage efficiency, performance, and fault tolerance requirements. We evaluate our system through simulation, with experimental results showing that our system is both efficient and sclable. We also perform experimentation to evaluate the fault tolerance of the system by measuring Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and using these values to calculate availability of the system. The results show that higher replication levels result in higher system availability, however, the number of files in the system also effects recovery time. We show that the tradeoff between replication levels and recovery time when the system overloads needs further investigation.","1555-0885","","","10.1109/ISORC.2014.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899176","Adaptive;Cloud Computing;Deduplication;Dependability;Fault-tolerance;Storage;Utility Computing","Adaptation models;Cloud computing;Fingerprint recognition;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Redundancy;Servers","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;storage management","MTTR measurement;cloud computing;computing resources;data deduplication technique;data volumes;fault tolerance requirements;fault-tolerant dynamic deduplication;mean time to repair;recovery time;replication levels;storage component;storage efficiency;utility computing","","0","","","","","10-12 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, due to poor broadband infrastructure and available grid power to support the Internet and ICT growth, the developing regions have actually been left even further behind. The basic requirements in any developing region (beyond clean water and food) are a reliable electric power grid, network infrastructure, education, jobs, and a stable government and banking system. Nothing works without the electric and network infrastructure in place. The sad fact is diesel generators are used to power everything in place of a stable power grid. The other sad fact is most of these countries have tremendous amount of wind or solar energy that can be used in place of imported fossil fuels. The developing regions in most cases are connected to the Internet; the question is how best to interconnect inside the regions and countries and move the data closer to the end user? We need a developing world approach, not our western model of bigger is better, ie over sized, energy hungry Data centers. Many papers have been written on how Cloud Computing will help the developing world by just lower ICT costs, yet this is a flawed theory. As the data, systems, telecommunication bandwidth, and people required still remain in the western world and its control. Moving processing and data closer to the user in the developing region plays an import role on three fronts; 1. Keeps needed jobs and systems ICT people in region, 2. Sidesteps high telecommunication bandwidth costs and network latency issues in and out of the region and 3. Quality of service: in region computing can remove a major points of network failure and potential bandwidth bottlenecks. Energy- efficient computing cannot be achieved without the integration between computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and environmental science. Designing data centers for the d- veloping regions require a vertically integrated efforts to drive key energy-efficient technologies in computing (cloud computing), electronics (low power CPUs and systems), and building systems (spot rack cooling, higher ambient temperatures, and natural convention cooling). Collectively, these technologies address very significant near-term and long-term energy challenges and environmental issues. What is that approach for developing region ICT, in region Green Cloud Computing, which is cloud computing using low power CPUs servers, and renewal energy and most important, which is closer to the end user.

How to provide these resources is a significant technical challenge that can be addressed from two directions. The first approach is to adapt existing batch queue based HPC systems to make them more interactive. The second approach is to start with existing interactive desktop environments (e.g., MATLAB) and design a system from the ground up that allows interactive parallel computing. The Lincoln Laboratory Grid (LLGrid) project has taken the latter approach. The LLGrid system has been operational for over a year with a few hundred processors and roughly 70 users, having run over 13,000 interactive jobs and consumed approximately 10,000 processor days of computation. This paper compares the on-demand and interactive computing features of four prominent batch queuing systems: openPBS, Sun GridEngine, Condor, and LSF. It goes on to briefly describe the LLGrid system, and how interactive, on-demand computing was achieved on it by binding to a resource management system. Finally, usage characteristics of the LLGrid system are discussed.","","0-7695-2496-6","","10.1109/DODUGC.2005.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592163","cluster computing;grid computing;interactive high performance computing;on-demand;parallel MATLAB.","Application software;Costs;Grid computing;High performance computing;Laboratories;MATLAB;Parallel processing;Pervasive computing;Resource management;Sun","","cluster computing;grid computing;interactive high performance computing;on-demand;parallel MATLAB.","","0","10","13","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the full potential of pervasive computing cannot be realized without enabling middleware technologies - henceforth referred to as ""middleware services""; i.e., they provide services for high level applications. In this paper, we introduce middleware services that are required to address the challenges related to adapting to dynamically changing situations, meeting communication QoS requirements, and achieving scalability in large-scale pervasive computing applications over heterogeneous network infrastructures. Our approach in developing middleware support for pervasive computing is based on the community computing concept, which provides us with a unified method to dynamically integrate the middleware services with each other and with high level applications on a just-in-time basis. The proposed middleware services for pervasive computing are highly modular, lightweight, and easily deployable to meet the needs of pervasive computing applications in networked environments. In this paper, we describe our proposed QoS algorithms and techniques for synergistic integration of middleware services into pervasive computing applications. In addition, we propose new performance metrics and a benchmark suite approach to evaluate middleware services in pervasive computing. Finally, we present some early prototype results from our proof of concept implementation.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265694","","Crisis management;Large-scale systems;Manufacturing automation;Measurement;Middleware;Military computing;Pervasive computing;Scalability;Space technology;Telemedicine","middleware;quality of service;ubiquitous computing","QoS middleware support;QoS requirements;automated user services;benchmark suite;continual user services;dynamic heterogeneous environments;heterogeneous network infrastructures;high level applications;large-scale pervasive computing applications;middleware services;performance metrics;real-time user services;unobtrusive user services","","3","","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An interesting and challenging environment where P2P technologies could be employed is represented by ""mobile ad hoc networks"" (MANETs), which show many similarities with P2P systems. However, many of the classic assumptions that can be made for classical wired P2P systems do not hold for such environments. In order to develop P2P applications on top of mobile handheld devices, a framework, named JMobiPeer has been developed. It has been designed to work on J2ME enabled mobile devices, interacting each other in an ad-hoc fashion.

By accessing the much more powerful computational resources of a cloud computing environment, GATE's run time can be significantly reduced to clinically feasible levels without the sizable investment of a local high performance cluster. This study investigated a reliable and efficient execution of GATE MC simulation using a commercial cloud computing services. A Monte Carlo cloud computing framework, Gate Cloud, for medical physics applications was proposed. Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was used to launch several nodes equipped with GATE V6.1. The Positron emission tomography (PET) Benchmark included in the GATE software was repeated for various cluster sizes between 1 and 100 nodes in order to establish the ideal cluster size in terms of cost and time efficiency. The study shows that increasing the number of nodes in the cluster resulted in a decrease in calculation time that could be expressed with an inverse power model. Simulation results were not affected by the cluster size, indicating that integrity of a calculation is preserved in a cloud computing environment. With high power computing continuing to lower in price and accessibility, implementing Gate Cloud for clinical applications will continue to become more attractive.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037699","GATE;GEANT4;Monte Carlo simulation;cloud computing;medical physics","Benchmark testing;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Logic gates;Monte Carlo methods;Positron emission tomography","Monte Carlo methods;cloud computing;digital simulation;medical computing;medicine;positron emission tomography;workstation clusters","Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud;EC2;GATE MC simulation;GATE V6.1;GATE software;GEANT4-based GATE;GateCloud;Monte Carlo cloud computing framework;Monte Carlo simulation;PET benchmark;commercial cloud computing services;high power computing;inverse power model;medical physics applications;positron emission tomography","","0","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main characteristics of these data sets is that not only the number of available genome files is becoming extremely large, but also each individual data set is significantly large, in the order of tens of GB. Hence, a wide diffusion of cloud-based genomic data processing will have a significant impact on network resources, since each processing request will require the transfer of tens of GBs into computing nodes. To face this issue, in this paper we propose a resource discovery framework which provides decision agents with the needed information for selecting the most suitable computing nodes.

Integration of IoTs with cloud computing, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) can help achieve the goals of envisioned IoT and future Internet. This IoT-Cloud computing integration is not straight-forward. It involves many challenges. One of those challenges is data trimming. Because unnecessary communication not only burdens the core network, but also the data center in the cloud. For this purpose, data can be preprocessed and trimmed before sending to the cloud. This can be done through a Smart Gateway, accompanied with a Smart Network or Fog Computing.

With advent of cloud computing, computing functions and storage processing are migrating to remote resources like virtual servers stored in systems which are mostly hosted in the data centers located in various places. Virtualization technology has been used widely in modern data center in order to improve its energy efficiency. Virtual machine (VM) migration has recently emerged technique used as an essential building block for data center and storage systems, mainly due to its service provisioning and energy aware consolidation. We analysed the existing energy consumption model for various types of services in cloud computing environment and we present a new energy-aware provisioning approach by considering energy efficiency as a key factor.

In post-disaster contexts however, cloud-based mapping services and data may be unavailable because of network challenges. Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) architectures have been proposed for data sharing in challenged networks. However, map generation may be too complex for individual DTN nodes given their limited computing resources. To generate and share maps of disaster areas, we present DTN MapEx, a distributed computing system for mapping that operates over a DTN. DTN MapEx distributes disaster map data and map generation tasks to multiple nodes to minimize individual computational loads. In the system, responders and volunteers act as mobile sensing nodes. They log the GPS traces of their traversed paths and collect disaster area map data such as the coordinates, images, and assessments of points-of-interest. The mobile nodes then route their collected data and a task request through the DTN to pre-deployed, fixed Computing Nodes. The Computing Nodes aggregate the data to generate a map and opportunistically route it back to the network. To reduce complexity, mapping tasks and data are divided amongst Computing Nodes based on their current computational load. Computing Nodes periodically update the DTN about their current loads. Mobile nodes use these updates in deciding where to allocate their task requests and data. In this paper, we present the design of DTN MapEx and perform initial evaluations on its feasibility in disaster scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICMU.2015.7061063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061063","Delay Tolerant Network;Disaster Management;Distributed Computing","Delays;Global Positioning System;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Sensors","Global Positioning System;delay tolerant networks;emergency management;mobile computing;resource allocation","DTN MapEx;DTN architecture;DTN node;GPS traces;cloud-based mapping service;computing nodes;computing resource;data sharing;delay tolerant network;disaster area map data;disaster area map generation;disaster area mapping;disaster map data;disaster response operation;disruption tolerant network architecture;distributed computing system;map generation task;mobile node;mobile sensing node;post-disaster context;request allocation","","0","","19","","","20-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Service Level Agreements signed at the beginning between the clients and service providers stipulate conditions of the services including the QoS requirements. Trust can be used to quantify the QoS levels of providers and rank them according to their performances. Hence trust management systems can play an important role in identifying the right service provider who would maintain the QoS at the levels required by the clients. Researchers have proposed several trust computing mechanisms based on different techniques and trust metrics on the literature. Almost all of these mechanisms increment or decrement the trust scores monotonously based on the inputs. This is a major vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries to force the trust scores towards extreme values. In this paper, the authors propose a novel trust computing mechanism based on hysteresis function which requires extra efforts to force the output from one end to the other. Hysteresis functions are immune to small changes and hence can be used to protect the system from sporadic attacks. The proposed mechanism has been tested using simulations. The test results show that the trust scores computed using the proposed mechanism are more robust and stable in the face of attacks than other mechanisms.","2159-3442","978-1-4673-4823-2","978-1-4673-4822-5","10.1109/TENCON.2012.6412307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6412307","cloud computing;hysteresis;quality of service;trust computing","Cloud computing;Entropy;Hardware;Hysteresis;Magnetic hysteresis;Quality of service;Time factors","cloud computing;hysteresis;quality of service;trusted computing","QoS requirements;cloud computing;computing resources;extreme values;hysteresis function;hysteresis-based robust trust computing mechanism;service level agreements;sporadic attacks;trust management systems;trust scores","","0","","30","","","19-22 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of digital environments begins with the trust (established in the real world) in the organisation/individual that manages the digital resources. This concept evolved to deal with the rapid growth of the Internet, where it became impractical for entities to have prior offline (real world) trust. The evolution of digital trust took diverse approaches and now trust is defined and understood differently across heterogeneous domains. This paper looks at digital trust from the point of view of security and examines how valid trust approaches from other domains are now making their way into secure computing. The paper also revisits and analyses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) along with associated technologies and their relevance in the changing landscape. We especially focus on the domains of cloud computing, mobile computing and cyber-physical systems.

Cloud resources and services are available in pay-as-you-go mode, which brings extraordinary flexibility and cost-effectiveness as well as zero investment in their own computing infrastructure. However, these advantages come at a price-people no longer have direct control over their own data. Based on this view, data security becomes a major concern in the adoption of cloud computing. Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is essential to a security system that is based on high efficiency symmetric-key encryption. With virtualization technology being applied, existing key exchange schemes such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) becomes time-consuming when directly deployed into cloud computing environment. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange (CBHKE). Based on our previous work, CBHKE aims at providing secure and efficient scheduling for cloud computing environment. In our new scheme, we design a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative key exchange strategy to achieve more efficient AKE without sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that when deployed in cloud computing environment, efficiency of the proposed scheme is dramatically superior to its predecessors CCBKE and IKE schemes.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680817","big data;cloud computing;efficient security-aware scheduling;key exchange;virtualisation security","Cloud computing;Data handling;Encryption;Information management;Processor scheduling","cloud computing;distributed processing;iterative methods","AKE;CBHKE;IKE;Internet key exchange;authenticated key exchange;big data applications;cloud background hierarchical key exchange;cloud computing environment;cloud resources;cloud services;data intensive computation;data security;distributed computing platform;iterative hierarchical key exchange scheme;iterative key exchange;secure scheduling;security system;symmetric key encryption","","1","","30","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution, named ad hoc Grid, leverages on the OurGrid (OG) middleware, which is an open source P2P computing grid. OG requires some centralized administration, preventing it to be used for deploying spontaneous (ad hoc) computing grids. To make the P2P grid adaptive and self-organizing, new approaches were adopted for Peer discovery, failure handling and failure recovery. Grid nodes communicate via multicast: a set of grid members (e.g., nodes in the same local network) are logically connected to a single Peer, and they coordinate through a local multicast group; as for the Peers, they get to know each other through another multicast group, by exchanging periodical and on demand messages which allow them to coordinate and keep the grid connected. Instead of having a static and well defined role in the grid as in the OG architecture, any grid node might eventually take the Peer role. This way, the grid can be instantiated even with a single node, and grow as new nodes join the grid. ad hoc Grid is well suited for those willing to quickly deploy a computing grid without requiring any centralized administration, by just combining the computing power of distributed machinery of users willing to join the grid.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578220","peer-to-peer computing grid;self-organizing systems","Ad hoc networks;Buildings;IP networks;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Servers","grid computing;middleware;peer-to-peer computing","OG architecture;OurGrid middleware;ad hoc computing grids;adaptive peer-to-peer computing grid;centralized administration;failure handling;failure recovery;grid nodes;local multicast group;open source P2P computing grid;peer discovery;self-organizing peer-to-peer computing grid","","1","","7","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because mobile devices still have limited processor power, computing-intensive applications need to be offloaded to either remote clouds or nearby cloudlets for processing. But, remote cloud computing is hindered by the long latency and expensive roaming charges of cellular radio access. Therefore, cloudlet computing becomes appealing to provide instant and low-cost service through resource-rich devices (e.g., desktops) in the vicinity of mobile devices. It is evident that cloudlet computing is challenged by the intermittent connection between cloudlets and mobile devices due to user mobility. The question is how to evaluate the impact of user mobility on cloudlet computing performance. In this paper, we examine the cloudlet access probability, task success rate, and task execution speed to measure the impact of mobility. We discover that the cloudlet access probability is μT<sub>c</sub> /(μT<sub>1</sub> + μT<sub>c</sub>) determined by mean connection time μT<sub>c</sub> and mean inter-connection time μT<sub>1</sub> between the mobile device and the cloudlet. Furthermore, we find that the task success rate and execution speed depend on not only task computation demand and cloudlet computing speed but also cloudlet access probability. Our findings reveal that the ratio μT<sub>c</sub> /(μT<sub>1</sub> + μT <sub>c</sub>) quantifies the impact of node mobility on both cloudlet access probability and cloudlet computing performance.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6855742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855742","","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Smart phones","cellular radio;cloud computing;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;smart phones","cellular radio access;cloudlet access probability;cloudlet computing;computation demand;computing-intensive applications;instant service;intermittent connection;limited processor power;low-cost service;mobile applications;mobile devices;node mobility;remote cloud computing;resource-rich devices;smartphones;task execution speed;task success rate;unheralded power;user mobility","","1","","","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through BIGS, eScience for image processing and analysis is conceived to exploit coarse grained parallelism based on data partitioning and parameter sweeps, avoiding the need of inter-process communication and, therefore, enabling loosely coupled computing nodes (BIGS workers). It adopts an uncommitted resource allocation model where (1) experimenters define their image processing pipelines in a simple configuration file, (2) a schedule of jobs is generated and (3) workers, as they become available, take over pending jobs as long as their dependency on other jobs is fulfilled. BIGS workers act autonomously, querying the job schedule to determine which one to take over. This removes the need for a central scheduling node, requiring only access by all workers to a shared information source. Furthermore, BIGS workers are encapsulated within different technologies to enable their agile deployment over the available computing resources. Currently they can be launched through the Amazon EC2 service over their cloud resources, through Java Web Start from any desktop computer and through regular scripting or SSH commands. This suits well different kinds of research environments, both when accessing dedicated computing clusters or clouds with committed computing capacity or when using opportunistic computing resources whose access is seldom or cannot be provisioned in advance. We also adopt a NoSQL storage model to ensure the scalability of the shared information sources required by all workers, including within BIGS support for HBase and Amazon's DynamoDB service. Overall, BIGS now enables researchers to run large scale image processing pipelines in an easy, af- ordable and unplanned manner with the capability to take over computing resources as they become available at run time. This is shown in this paper by using BIGS in different experimental setups in the Amazon cloud and in an opportunistic manner, demonstrating its configurability, adaptability and scalability capabilities.","","978-1-4673-4467-8","","10.1109/eScience.2012.6404424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404424","Image analysis;high performance computing;pattern recognition","Biomedical imaging;Computers;Databases;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Schedules","cloud computing;data analysis;image processing;parallel processing;pipeline processing;query processing","Amazon DynamoDB service;Amazon EC2 service;Amazon cloud;BIGS;HBase service;Java Web Start;NoSQL storage model;SSH command scripting;agile deployment;big image data analysis toolkit;cloud resources;coarse grained parallelism;computing clusters;data partitioning;desktop computer;distributed computing resources;eScience;encapsulation;heterogeneous computing resources;job schedule generation;job schedule querying;large-scale image analysis;large-scale image processing pipelines;loosely coupled computing nodes;parameter sweeps;shared information source scalability;software framework;uncommitted resource allocation model","","2","","23","","","8-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel infrastructure that combines the benefits of grid and cloud computing: Cheap multi-organizational resources and private compute nodes with root access reachable from the Internet. Our previously introduced virtualization of grid resources is extended by an approach to offer the same freedom of network access cloud computing offers, but in a multi-organizational and shared use environment without endangering existing users or resources. An approach is presented for the dynamic network isolation of grid users from each other as well as a mechanism for shielding the grid infrastructure from malicious users and attacks from the Internet.

Thus, clouds have the potential to provide to their owners the benefits of an economy of scale and, at the same time, become an alternative for scientists to clusters, grids, and parallel production environments. However, the current commercial clouds have been built to support web and small database workloads, which are very different from typical scientific computing workloads. Moreover, the use of virtualization and resource time-sharing may introduce significant performance penalties for the demanding scientific computing workloads. In this work we analyze the performance of cloud computing services for scientific computing workloads. We quantify the presence in real scientific computing workloads of Many-Task Computing (MTC) users, that is, of users who employ loosely coupled applications comprising many tasks to achieve their scientific goals. Then, we perform an empirical evaluation of the performance of four commercial cloud computing services including Amazon EC2, and we compare through trace-based simulation the performance characteristics and cost models of clouds and other scientific computing platforms.

However, security, privacy and trust are amongst the issues that can subvert the benefits and hence wide deployment of cloud computing. With the introduction of omnipresent mobile-based clients, the ubiquity of the model increases, suggesting a still higher integration in life. Nonetheless, the security issues rise to a higher degree as well. The constrained input methods for credentials and the vulnerable wireless communication links are among factors giving rise to serious security issues. To strengthen the access control of cloud resources, organizations now commonly acquire Identity Management Systems (IdM). This paper presents that the most popular IdM, namely OAuth, working in scope of Mobile Cloud Computing has many weaknesses in authorization architecture. In particular, authors find two major issues in current IdM. First, if the IdM System is compromised through malicious code, it allows a hacker to get authorization of all the protected resources hosted on a cloud. Second, all the communication links among client, cloud and IdM carries complete authorization token, that can allow hacker, through traffic interception at any communication link, an illegitimate access of protected resources. We also suggest a solution to the reported problems, and justify our arguments with experimentation and mathematical modeling.","","","","10.1109/MobileCloud.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6834955","Cloud Computing Security;Identity Management System;Mobile Cloud Computing;Modified Identity Management System;Secure Mobile Computing","Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer hacking;Mobile communication;Organizations;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;mathematical analysis;mobile computing;radio links;security of data","IdM;OAuth;access control;authorization architecture;cloud resources;computing models;credentials;hacker;identity management systems;malicious code;mathematical modeling;multitoken authorization strategy;omnipresent mobile-based clients;privacy;secure mobile cloud computing;security;traffic interception;trust;vulnerable wireless communication links","","0","","24","","","8-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But such collaboration is necessary with the trend of data partition among different entities nowadays. Besides, most of the existing work are based on the semi-honest cloud assumption and can not deal with the malicious cloud situation well. In this paper, we explore the secure and practical outsourced collaborative data mining scheme in cloud computing scenarios. We design a simple framework for it and propose several enhanced frameworks and detailed schemes in an incremental way with stronger security considerations. The final framework utilizes trusted computing technology to design the scheme under the malicious cloud assumption. Finally, we give a summary of security and efficiency analysis about them.

However, due to the rapidly growing number of service offerings and the lack of a standard for their specification, manual service selection is a costly task, preventing the successful implementation of ubiquitous computing on demand. In order to counteract these issues, automatic methods for matching SLAs are necessary. In this paper, we introduce a method for finding semantically equal SLA elements from differing SLAs by utilizing several machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we utilize this method to enable automatic selection of optimal service offerings for Cloud and Grid users. Finally, we introduce a framework for automatic SLA management, present a simulation-based evaluation, and demonstrate several significant benefits of our approach for Cloud and Grid users.","1550-5510","978-1-4673-2901-9","","10.1109/Grid.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319158","Cloud computing;SLA mapping;SLA matching;Service Level Agreement;autonomic computing;electronic markets;machine learning;provider selection","Cloud computing;Measurement;Memory management;Ontologies;Quality of service;Semantics;Syntactics","cloud computing;grid computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;service-oriented architecture;ubiquitous computing","automatic SLA management;automatic SLA matching;automatic methods;cloud computing markets;grid markets;hardware services;machine learning algorithms;manual service selection;optimal service offerings;provider selection;semantically equal SLA elements;service level agreements;service usage;simulation-based evaluation;software services;ubiquitous computing","","3","","34","","","20-23 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

I-SPAN 2008. International Symposium on","20080516","2008","","","3","3","Summary form only given. Membrane computing, first introduced in 1998 by Gheorghe Paun, is a part of the general research effort of describing and investigating computing models, ideas, architectures, and paradigms from the processes taking place in nature. It is a branch of molecular computing that is motivated by cell biology. Membrane computing identifies an unconventional computing model, namely a P system, which abstracts from the way living cells process chemical compounds in their compartmental structure. Regions defined by a membrane structure contain multisets of objects that evolve according to specified rules. The objects can be represented as symbols or strings of symbols. By using the rules in a nondeterministic (deterministic) maximally parallel manner, transitions between the system configurations can be obtained. A sequence of transitions is a computation of how the system is evolving. Various ways of controlling the transfer of objects from one region to another and applying the rules, as well as possibilities to dissolve, divide or create membranes have been studied. P systems have a great potential for implementing massively concurrent systems in an efficient way that would allow us to solve currently intractable problems once future bio-technology gives way to a practical bio- realization. Since its introduction, the literature in this area has grown rapidly (in 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information designated the initialpaper as ""fast breaking"" and the domain as an ""emerging research front in computer science""). We give a brief overview of membrane computing and report on recent results that answer some interesting and fundamental open questions in the field. We also look at the recently introduced neural-like systems, called spiking neural P systems. These systems incorporate the ideas of spiking neurons into membrane computing. We present various classes and characterize their computing power and complexity. In particular, we analyze - asynchronous and sequential systems and present some conditions under which they become (non-)universal. The non-universal variants are characterized by monotonic counter machines and partially blind counter machines. The latter devices are known to be equivalent to vector addition systems (or Petri nets) and, hence, have many decidable properties.","1087-4089","978-0-7695-3125-0","","10.1109/I-SPAN.2008.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4520185","Membrane computing;P system;spiking neural P system","Abstracts;Biological cells;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Biomembranes;Chemical compounds;Computer architecture;Counting circuits;Molecular computing;Sequences","biocomputing;computational complexity","Petri net;asynchronous system;computational complexity;decidability;massively concurrent systems;membrane computing;membrane system;molecular computing;monotonic counter machine;nonuniversal variant;partially blind counter machine;sequential system;spiking neural P system;vector addition system","","0","","","","","7-9 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outsourcing however does not allow data owners to outsource the responsibility of confidentiality, integrity and access control, as it still is the responsibility of the data owner. As cloud computing is transparent to both the programmers and the users, it induces challenges that were not present in previous forms of distributed computing. Furthermore, cloud computing enables its users to abstract away from low-level configuration such as configuring IP addresses and routers. It creates an illusion that this entire configuration is automated. This illusion is also true for security services, for instance automating security policies and access control in cloud, so that individuals or end-users using the cloud only perform very high-level (business oriented) configuration. This paper investigates the security challenges posed by the transparency of distribution, abstraction of configuration and automation of services by performing a detailed threat analysis of cloud computing across its different deployment scenarios (private, bursting, federation or multi-clouds). This paper also presents a risk inventory which documents the security threats identified in terms of availability, integrity and confidentiality for cloud infrastructures in detail for future security risks. We also propose a methodology for performing security risk assessment for cloud computing architectures presenting some of the initial results.","","978-1-4673-4511-8","978-1-4673-4509-5","10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6427574","cloud computing;risk assessment;security threats","Access control;Availability;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Risk management","authorisation;cloud computing;configuration management;data integrity;document handling;outsourcing;resource allocation;risk analysis;service-oriented architecture","access control;automatic configuration;automatic security policy;business oriented configuration;cloud computing architecture;cloud infrastructure;configuration abstraction;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed computing;distribution transparency;document handling;economic benefit;end-user computing;resource outsourcing;risk inventory;security management;security risk analysis;security service;security threat identification;service automation;threat analysis","","4","","49","","","3-6 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our scheme takes into account these diverse aspects of heterogeneous nodes to maximize overall system throughput.

We describe approaches that minimize messaging costs without sacrificing the failure resilience provided by an underlying peer-to-peer overlay network.

However, cloud computing, just like other formats of computing, is not free from issues. One of the major barriers in adoption of cloud is security. Once migrated to cloud, you do not know where your data is physically stored, what laws and regulations govern the same and most important of all, who has access to it. This paper explores security issues related to cloud computing and proposes a paradigm for securing cloud. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud environment, followed by conclusion where we try to entail the whole research and try to formulate a practical security paradigm, which will enable the cloud providers and consumers to ensure that their data and valuable assets are safe from otherwise prying eyes.","","978-1-4673-2640-7","","10.1109/CICSyN.2012.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274341","Cloud;Cloud Computing;Security Challenges;Security Paradigm;distributed computing;security","Authorization;Cloud computing;Organizations;Standards organizations","cloud computing;security of data;service-oriented architecture","Internet;catchphrase;cloud computing;cloud providers;cloud security paradigms;cloud-aware security solutions;computing infrastructure;computing needs;cost-effective solutions;dynamic cloud environment;services-based environment","","1","","19","","","24-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The potentially very large number of independent computing units, a decoupled computing style, frequent disconnections, continuous position changes, and the location-dependent nature of the behavior and communication patterns of the individual components present designers with unprecedented challenges in the areas of modularity and dependability. The paper describes two ideas regarding a modular approach to specifying and reasoning about mobile computing. The novelty of our approach rests with the notion of allowing transient interactions among programs which move in space. We restrict our concern to pairwise interactions involving variable sharing and action synchronization. The motivation behind the transient nature of the interactions comes from the fact that components can communicate with each other only when they are within a certain range. The notation we propose is meant to simplify the writing of mobile applications and is a direct extension of that used in UNITY.

A real time system can take advantage of intensive computing capabilities and scalable virtualized environment of cloud computing to execute real time tasks. In most of the real time cloud applications, processing is done on remote cloud computing nodes. So there are more chances of errors, due to the undetermined latency and loose control over computing node. On the other side, most of the real time systems are also safety critical and should be highly reliable. So there is an increased requirement for fault tolerance to achieve reliability for the real time computing on cloud infrastructure. In this paper, a fault tolerance model for real time cloud computing is proposed. In the proposed model, the system tolerates the faults and makes the decision on the basis of reliability of the processing nodes, i.e. virtual machines. The reliability of the virtual machines is adaptive, which changes after every computing cycle. If a virtual machine manages to produce a correct result within the time limit, its reliability increases. And if it fails to produce the result within time or correct result, its reliability decreases. A metric model is given for the reliability assessment. In the model, decrease in reliability is more than increase. If the node continues to fail, it is removed, and a new node is added. There is also a minimum reliability level. If any processing node does not achieve that level, the systems will perform backward recovery or safety measures. The proposed technique is based on the execution of design diverse variants on multiple virtual machines, and assigning reliability to the results produced by variants. The virtual machine instances can be of same type or of different types. The system provides both the forward and backward recovery mechanism, but main focus is on forward recovery. The main essence of the propos- - ed technique is the adaptive behavior of the reliability weights assigned to each processing node and adding and removing of nodes on the basis of reliability.","","978-1-4577-0879-4","978-0-7695-4461-8","10.1109/SERVICES.2011.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012725","cloud computing;fault tolerance;reliability","Computational modeling;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Real time systems;Reliability engineering;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;software reliability;virtual machines","adaptive fault tolerance;backward recovery mechanism;forward recovery mechanism;metric model;real time cloud computing;reliability assessment;virtual machine","","7","","16","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20040226","2004","","","9 pp.","","Applications of information technology (IT) have in no doubt had significant impact in every stage of service provision, production, delivery, receipt and quality. Today, the greatly increased use of IT by service providers has in many ways changed the nature of service delivery. The dynamism and rapid changes in IT which progress from traditional business computing to mobile and pervasive computing and which is now tending towards ubiquitous computing have posed serious challenges to service globally. Service in the industrial era was well understood. It was considered distinct to product and limited by geographical locations and technological constraints. However, as we are entering the knowledge era, where knowledge has become the main competitive advantage, the distinction between services and products are blurring with increase application of information technology, and there seems to be no limit to what could be achieved with technology. Dynamism in the production of information technology also requires corresponding dynamism in its applications to the service provision. However, there is lack of adequate attention to these issues in information systems research and practice. There is little understanding of how the rapid changes and developments in IT could affect service provision. Using the four characteristics of service - intangibility, inseparability (of production and consumption), perishability and heterogeneity, this paper examines service provision, the current trends in ubiquitous computing and the possible changes it could have on service provision.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265213","","Computer industry;Educational institutions;Embedded computing;Information technology;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Physics computing;Production;Telecommunication computing;Ubiquitous computing","service industries;ubiquitous computing","computing capability;information technology;service delivery;service provision;technological constraint;ubiquitous computing","","0","","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, cloud nodes can potentially misbehave in order to save resources. As such, some guarantee over the correctness and availability of results is needed. Exploiting the redundancy of cloud nodes can be of help, even though smart cheating strategies render the detection and correction of fake results much harder to achieve in practice. In this paper, we analyze the above issues and provide a solution for a specific problem that, nevertheless, is quite representative for a generic class of problems in the above setting: computing a vectorial function over a set of nodes. In particular, we introduce AntiCheetah, a novel autonomic multi-round approach performing the assignment of input elements to cloud nodes as an autonomic, self-configuring and self-optimizing cloud system. AntiCheetah is resilient against misbehaving nodes, and it is effective even in worst-case scenarios and against smart cheaters that behave according to complex strategies. Further, we discuss benefits and pitfalls of the AntiCheetah approach in different scenarios. Preliminary experimental results over a custom-built, scalable, and flexible simulator (SofA) show the quality and viability of our solution.","","978-1-4799-2481-3","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726232","Autonomic Computing;Cloud;Secure Remote Computing;Simulation","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Conferences;Electronic mail;Reliability;Software as a service;Vectors","cloud computing;security of data","AntiCheetah;autonomic cloud system;autonomic multiround approach;cloud computing;computing-as-a-service;outsourced computing;reliable computing;self-configuring cloud system;self-optimizing cloud system;smart cheating strategy;vectorial function","","0","","24","","","18-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the era of cloud computing, the limitation on energy capacity can be eased off in an efficient way by offloading heavy tasks to the cloud. It is important for smartphone and cloud computing developers to have insights into the energy cost of smartphone applications before implementing the offloading techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the energy cost of multimedia applications on smartphones that are connected to Multimedia Cloud Computing (MCC). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to measure the energy costs to investigate whether or not smartphones save energy by using MCC services. In other words, we investigate the feasibility of MCC to provide the Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS). Specifically, we compared the energy costs for uploading and downloading a video file to and from MCC with the energy costs of encoding the same video file on a smartphone. The aforementioned comparison was performed by using HTTP and FTP Internet protocols with 3G and WiFi network interfaces. All the experiments were conducted on an Android based HTC Nexus One smartphone. Our results show that MCC provides the smartphones with many multimedia functionalities and saves smartphone energy from 30% to 70%.","2159-6182","978-1-4673-2892-0","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253577","Cloud Computing;Energy Costs;Handheld Device;Mobile Cloud Computing;Multimedia Application;Multimedia Cloud Computing;Power Consumption;Smartphone","Batteries;Cloud computing;Encoding;Multimedia communication;Network interfaces;Power demand;Protocols","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;energy conservation;multimedia computing;network interfaces;power aware computing;smart phones;transport protocols;video communication;wireless LAN","3G network interfaces;Android based HTC Nexus One smartphone;EaaS;FTP Internet protocols;HTTP Internet protocols;MCC services;WiFi network interfaces;cloud computing developers;energy capacity;energy cost measurement;energy-as-a-service;heavy task offloading technique;multimedia cloud computing efficacy;smartphone applications;smartphone developers;smartphone energy saving;video file downloading;video file uploading","","4","","23","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software faults and environmental factors. Autonomic anomaly detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect anomalous cloud behaviors, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime cloud performance data. These data consist of values of performance metrics for different types of failures, which display different correlations with the performance metrics. In this paper, we present an adaptive anomaly identification mechanism that explores the most relevant principal components of different failure types in cloud computing infrastructures. It integrates the cloud performance metric analysis with filtering techniques to achieve automated, efficient, and accurate anomaly identification. The proposed mechanism adapts itself by recursively learning from the newly verified detection results to refine future detections. We have implemented a prototype of the anomaly identification system and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment and by using the Google data center traces. Our experimental results show that our mechanism can achieve more efficient and accurate anomaly detection than other existing schemes.","","","","10.1109/SRDS.2013.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656276","Autonomic management;Cloud computing;Dependable systems;Failure detection;Learning algorithms","Cloud computing;Correlation;Measurement;Servers;Time series analysis;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;system monitoring;system recovery","Google data center traces;adaptive anomaly identification;adaptive mechanism;anomalous cloud behavior detection;anomaly identification system;cloud computing infrastructure;cloud execution monitor;cloud performance metric analysis;complex computing infrastructure;complexity;detection result verification;emergent cloud-wide phenomena;environmental factor;failure type;filtering technique;hardware fault;metric subspace exploration;on-campus cloud computing environment;production cloud computing system;recursive learning;runtime cloud performance data collection;runtime problem;self-managing cloud resource;software fault;system-level dependability assurance","","6","","43","","","Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 3 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Utility computing, reliable data storage, and infrastructure-independent computing are example applications of such systems. Electrical energy cost of a cloud computing system is a strong function of the consolidation and migration techniques used to assign incoming clients to existing servers. Moreover, each client typically has a service level agreement (SLA), which specifies constraints on performance and/or quality of service that it receives from the system. These constraints result in a basic trade-off between the total energy cost and client satisfaction in the system. In this paper, a resource allocation problem is considered that aims to minimize the total energy cost of cloud computing system while meeting the specified client-level SLAs in a probabilistic sense. The cloud computing system pays penalty for the percentage of a client's requests that do not meet a specified upper bound on their service time. An efficient heuristic algorithm based on convex optimization and dynamic programming is presented to solve the aforesaid resource allocation problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work.","","978-1-4673-1395-7","","10.1109/CCGrid.2012.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217419","Cloud Computing;Data center;Energy Efficiency;Server Consolidation;Service Level Agreement;Virtual Machine Placement","Cloud computing;Contracts;Memory management;Optimization;Resource management;Servers;Time factors","cloud computing;convex programming;dynamic programming;resource allocation;software cost estimation;software reliability;storage management;utility programs","SLA-based optimization;cloud computing systems;consolidation techniques;convex optimization;data storage reliability;dynamic programming;electrical energy cost;heuristic algorithm;hosting datacenters;infrastructure-independent computing;migration cost;migration techniques;power cost;quality-of-service;resource allocation problem;service level agreement;utility computing","","24","","24","","","13-16 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CNFs motivate a view of the Internet as a vast unified host: a repository of information, application services, and an omnipresent supercomputing resource regardless of the type of access device or access methodology. CNFs provide a powerful way of virtualizing generalized enterprise networks (or even the Internet), and an economic and resilient model for deploying enterprise applications, (such as CRM) and peer-2-peer services (e.g., chatrooms). This paper describes a middleware architecture that enables network-based computing, communications, and services through a unified, access, and platform-independent approach. CNFs borrow from the capabilities of grid computing and aim toward intelligent computational service networks that are ubiquitous, secure, and adaptive to user and access-method idiosyncrasies. CNFs encompass a set of abstractions and interfaces that provide: 1) a unified service-oriented view of the network to the user; 2) a homogeneous host abstraction to applications; and 3) a shared-memory abstraction to software developers.

Along with these opportunities come challenges, particularly to service providers and operations centers that struggle to monitor and manage quality of service (QoS) for these services in order to meet customer service commitments. Traditional approaches fall short in addressing these challenges because they examine QoS from a limited perspective rather than from a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective applicable to a net-centric enterprise system in which any user from any location can share computing resources at any time.

However, despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the security of an open-ended and rather freely accessible resource is still questionable which impacts the cloud adoption. The security problem becomes amplified under the cloud model as new dimensions enter into the problem scope related to the architecture, multi-tenancy, layer dependency, and elasticity. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. It investigates the problem of security from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud characteristics perspective, cloud delivery model perspective, and the cloud stakeholder perspective. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud model.

The concurrent use of multiple distributed compute resources is vital for making scientific progress. The resulting distributed system, a so-called Jungle Computing System, is both highly heterogeneous and hierarchical, potentially consisting of grids, clouds, stand-alone machines, clusters, desktop grids, mobile devices, and supercomputers, possibly with accelerators such as GPUs. One striking example of applications that can benefit greatly of Jungle Computing Systems are Multi-Model / Multi-Kernel simulations. In these simulations, multiple models, possibly implemented using different techniques and programming models, are coupled into a single simulation of a physical system. Examples include the domain of computational astrophysics and climate modeling. In this paper we investigate the use of Jungle Computing Systems for such Multi-Model / Multi-Kernel simulations. We make use of the software developed in the Ibis project, which addresses many of the problems faced when running applications on Jungle Computing Systems.

We present Pantagruel, a visual programming language that is end-user oriented. Our approach is open-ended in that Pantagruel integrates a language to describe a ubiquitous computing environment. Such description takes the form of a taxonomy, defining the entities relevant to a given ubiquitous computing area. This description serves as a parameter to a sensor-controller-actuator development paradigm. The orchestration of area-specific entities is supported by high-level constructs, customized with respect to taxonomical information. We have implemented a visual environment to prototyping ubiquitous computing applications. Furthermore, we have developed a compiler for Pantagruel that targets a domain-specific middleware. Our environment leverages a 2D Tenderer to enable the simulation and of applications.

In many cases, the data generation software is too tuned to a single-processor infrastructure to be readily adapted for emerging parallel and grid computing environments. This paper presents several lessons learned from adapting an aerospace engineering tool to the parallel and grid computing architecture. The architecture provides the ability to perform high-power computing by distributing process execution across many computers connected by a dedicated network or the Internet. Some of the challenging tasks involved in the adaptation are (1) to decouple the user interface and display functions from the computational functions, since interaction and graphics are usually unnecessary expenses in parallel and grid computing, (2) to identify and parallelize computationally expensive functions without the drastic modification of the code and data structures, (3) to find a lightweight, yet versatile software solution for a client-server machine interface for remote job execution.

The basic tenet of the ATE community is to support a multi-tiered maintenance concept which, in general, is a three tiered system that is composed of organizational maintenance (O-level), intermediate maintenance (I-level), and depot maintenance (D-level) organizations. The goal of the ATE is to (1) quickly and accurately detect and isolate each fault, (2) provide software tools for analyzing historical data, and (3) gather, manage, and distribute accurate and reliable maintenance information for the failed Unit Under Test (UUT). The ATE system should provide services that will (1) maintain a repository of information that will improve fault detection and isolation, allow for off-platform assessments, document failures, and help quantify corrective actions, (2) reduce false UUT pulls, and (3) reduce repair time by prompting repair procedures. Furthermore, the ATE system should provide additional services that will help optimize the time to diagnose problems by using collected failure information and by recommending entry points into the Test Program Set (TPS) software. It should also present information to the ATE maintainer to aid in informed repair decisions which could be in the form of pilot debrief results, platform Built In Test (BIT) results, O-level test outcomes and corrective actions, and maintenance and usage history of the platform and UUT. So, based on this definition of ATE maintenance the use of cloud computing can be used to provide services to improve the overall ATE testing throughput which will result in bottom line improvements to ATE life cycle costs. By using cloud computing, which is defined to be “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, - n-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”, users can develop cloud computing models that will provide access to application software and databases that can be used to build a globally linked ATE maintenance system. This paper will discuss the essential characteristics of the cloud computing models and define the various flavors of cloud offerings available to designers today. This paper will also analyze the cloud computing model to arrive at a conceptual approach that can be used to enhance the current ATE Testing and Maintenance capabilities. Practical recommendations will be discussed on how to transform the current ATE Testing and Maintenance capabilities into the specific cloud computing model offerings in order to help configure a globally linked ATE maintenance system.","1088-7725","978-1-4673-5681-7","","10.1109/AUTEST.2013.6645048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645048","ATE;Cloud Computing;architecture;maintenance","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Maintenance engineering;Organizations;Security;Standards organizations","automatic test software;cloud computing;fault diagnosis;maintenance engineering","automatic test equipment testing;built in test;cloud computing;depot maintenance;failure information;fault detection;fault isolation;globally linked ATE maintenance system;intermediate maintenance;organizational maintenance;repair;test program set software;unit under test","","0","","4","","","16-19 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Resource monitoring involves collecting information of system resources to facilitate decision making by other components in Cloud environment. It is the foundation of many major Cloud computing operations. In this paper, we extend the prevailing monitoring methods in Grid computing, namely Pull model and Push model, to the paradigm of Cloud computing. In Grid computing, we find that in certain conditions, Push model has high consistency but low efficiency, while Pull model has low consistency but high efficiency. Based on complementary properties of the two models, we propose a user-oriented resource monitoring model named Push&Pull (P&P) for Cloud computing, which employs both the above two models, and switches the two models intelligently according to users' requirements and monitored resources' status. The experimental result shows that the P&P model decreases updating costs and satisfies various users' requirements of consistency between monitoring components and monitored resources compared to the original models.","","978-1-4244-8207-8","978-0-7695-4130-3","10.1109/CLOUD.2010.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557986","","Adaptation model;Cloud computing;Clouds;Computational modeling;Grid computing;Load modeling;Monitoring","grid computing;resource allocation","cloud computing environment;combined push-pull model;grid computing;pull model;push model;resource monitoring","","4","","16","","","5-10 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This methodology is potentially a good vehicle for translating natural phenomena, representable via mathematical models, into practical p2p protocols. Concretely, our first contribution is a set of techniques to translate certain discrete ""sequence equations"" rigorously into new p2p protocols called ""sequence protocols"". Sequence protocols are self-adaptive, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with applicability in p2p settings like grids. A sequence protocol is a set of probabilistic local and message-passing actions for each process. These actions are translated from terms in a set of source sequence equations. Without having each process simulate the source sequence equations, the emergent behavior of a sequence protocol in a p2p system is equivalent to, and predicted by, its source sequence equations. This paper's second contribution is a new self-adaptive grid computing protocol called ""HoneyAdapt"". HoneyAdapt is derived from sequence equations modeling adaptive bee foraging behavior in nature. HoneyAdapt is intended for grid applications that allow grid clients, at run-time, a choice of algorithms for executing chunks of the application's dataset. HoneyAdapt tells each grid client how to adaptively select at run-time, for each chunk it receives, a ""good"" algorithm for computing the chunk - this selection is based on continuous feedback from other clients. We present analysis, large-scale simulation results, and deployment results.","","0-7695-2906-2","","10.1109/SASO.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274885","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Distributed computing;Equations;Grid computing;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Runtime","grid computing;mathematics computing;message passing;peer-to-peer computing","HoneyAdapt;discrete sequence equation;distributed computing;grid computing protocol;mathematical model;mathematics-inspired algorithm;message-passing;p2p protocol;self-adaptive peer-to-peer computing;sequence protocol","","0","","26","","","9-11 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers have been employed to address these needs. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure with the ability to perform parallel computations using large pools of virtual machines (VMs). The infrastructure services (Infrastructure-as-a-service), provided by these cloud vendors, allow any user to provision a large number of compute instances. However, scientific computing is typically characterized by complex communication patterns and requires optimized runtimes. Today, VMs are manually instantiated, configured and maintained by cloud users. These coupled with the latency, crash and omission failures in service providers, results in an inefficient use of VMs, increased complexity in VM-management tasks, a reduction in the overall computation power and increased time for task completion. In this paper, a high performance cloud computing strategy is proposed that combines the adaptation of a parallel processing framework, such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and an efficient checkpoint infrastructure for VMs, enabling its effective use for scientific computing. By developing such a mechanism, we can achieve optimized runtimes comparable to native clusters, improve checkpoints with low interference on task execution and provide efficient task recovery. In addition, check pointing is used to minimize the cost and volatility of resource provisioning, while improving overall reliability. Analysis and simulations show that the proposed approach compares favorably with the native cluster MPI implementations.","1530-2075","978-1-61284-425-1","978-0-7695-4577-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009011","","Checkpointing;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Program processors;Protocols","application program interfaces;checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;message passing;parallel machines;resource allocation;virtual machines","VM-management tasks;checkpoint infrastructure;cloud computing;cloud vendors;failures;fault-tolerant high performance cloud strategy;infrastructure services;interference;message passing interface;parallel computations;parallel processing;reliability;resource provisioning;scientific computing;task execution;task recovery;virtual machines","","2","","29","","","16-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, efficient allocation of jobs to computing resources for load balancing is essential in these grid systems. In this paper, two price-based dynamic job allocation schemes for computational grids are proposed whose objective is to minimize the execution cost for the grid users' jobs. One scheme tries to provide a system-optimal solution so that the expected price for the execution of all the jobs in the grid system is minimized, while the other tries to provide a job-optimal solution so that all the jobs in the system of the same size will be charged approximately the same expected price independent of the computers allocated for their execution to provide fairness.

The proposed mechanism estimates the time to start the job execution in a queue system from the history of job-execution on vector supercomputers. Based on the estimation, the job scheduling mechanism automatically allocates the job to an appropriate site, which can execute the job earlier. The simulation results show that the proposed job scheduling mechanism improves the utilization efficiency of vector computing resources, compared to the conventional round-robin scheduling mechanism.

The ubiquitous computing paradigm is considered suitable to support nursing at home provided that the distributed computing devices participate in the commonly interpreted context. Wirelessly and ad-hoc connected large numbers of disseminated sensors and computing devices in the home environment present problems related to energy limitations and the patients' mobility resulting in the introduction of systemic complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. In addition, describing such a system with analytical mathematics requires and includes extensive details becoming tedious if not impractical. Denotational mathematics provides an alternative formal methodological framework capable to describe the important components, the operation, and the behavior of such complicated systems. With the employment of denotational mathematics an attempt is made to design a system that develops medically valid contextual contents to support patients hospitalized at home. The developed design provides the contents of the medical context enriched by the rules of the current state of medical knowledge. The technically evolved context is compared against predetermined medical contexts to obtain valid interpretation. The presented design has the ambition to support efficiently the cooperation of the discrete software applications looking for the development of a commonly interpreted medical context at home.","","978-1-4799-6080-4","","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921449","denotational mathematics;home care;medical environment;ubiquitous computing","Context;Mathematics;Medical services;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ubiquitous computing","health care;medical computing;ubiquitous computing","analytical mathematics;analyzing medical contexts;computing devices;contextual contents;denotational mathematics;disseminated sensors;distributed computing devices;home environment;home healthcare;medical knowledge;patient mobility;ubiquitous computing home environments;ubiquitous computing paradigm","","0","","18","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, we argue that more research on the business side of cloud computing need to be done to help service providers to create innovative cloud business models and to get cloud computing to grow and develop in sustainable manner. In particular, the analysis and development of adequate revenue models and pricing mechanisms for cloud services is a critical challenge in this scenario, because pricing is expected to be one of the key changes compared to current paradigm. From the provider perspective, using an effective dynamic pricing strategy can make a difference between making a profit or a loss: in an open cloud marketplace, the strategy is even more important given its very dynamic and volatile nature. In this paper we analyze auction-based mechanisms to trade spare computing resources, which are alternative to the direct-sell and may turn to be profitable for both providers and consumers. Performed simulations show that accurate modeling and tuning of auction parameters can lead to maximize the utilization of resources.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681243","auctions;cloud computing;cloud market;pricing mechanisms","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Context;Procurement;Random access memory;Resource management","cloud computing;electronic commerce;pricing;procurement;profitability","auction parameter modeling;auction parameter tuning;auction-based mechanisms;cloud business models;cloud computing;cloud service providers;computing capacity trading;computing resource trading;dynamic pricing strategy;open cloud marketplace;pricing mechanism analysis;pricing mechanism development;procurement auctions;profitability;resource utilization maximization;revenue model analysis;revenue model development","","1","","17","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, when it is applied for feature selection for object detection, its learning process is to exhaustively evaluate every feature in a large set. With the increasing of image resolution and complexity of feature transformation approaches, the computational time will be extremely long, which makes the large scale AdaBoost learning very difficult. In this paper, we have employed Grid Computing to solve the difficulty. The proposed algorithm is to select the most significant features for face recognition. The selection algorithm is derived from multi-class AdaBoost, which exhaustively evaluate every feature from a large set. The deployed Grid Computing system is actually used for High Throughput Computing specialised on advanced resource management. To utilizing Grid Computing on the feature selection process, we have improved multi-class AdaBoost learning algorithm with parallel structure, so that the task of High Performance Computing is accomplished in the environment of High Throughput Computing. With Grid Computing, selecting 200 features from a large set of 30240 features is finished in 20 days, while without Grid Computing the time would be more than two years.

Integrating these technologies, however, is complicated by fundamental and inherent differences in the way in which these systems allocate resources to computational tasks. Cloud computing systems immediately allocate available resources or deny requests. In contrast, parallel computing systems route all requests through a queue for future resource allocation. This divergence of allocation policies hinders efforts to implement efficient, responsive, and reliable virtual clusters. In this paper, we present a continuum of four scheduling polices along with an analytical resource prediction model for each policy to estimate the level of resources needed to operate an efficient, responsive, and reliable virtual cluster system. We show that it is possible to estimate the size of the virtual cluster system needed to provide a predictable grade of service for a realistic high performance computing workload and estimate the queue wait time for a partial or full resource allocation. Moreover, we show that it is possible to provide a reliable virtual cluster system using a limited pool of spare resources. The models and results we present are useful for cloud computing providers seeking to operate efficient and cost-effective virtual cluster systems.","","","978-1-4503-0771-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114397","","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Equations;Mathematical model;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Resource management","cloud computing;parallel processing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","cloud computing technologies;flexible resource allocation;parallel computing systems;reliable virtual cluster computing systems;resource prediction model;scheduling polices;virtualization","","1","","","","","12-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scientific Cloud Computing, which targets high performance communities, has caused a shift over of the scientific applications running on conventional physical infrastructure to a more scalable and flexible virtual infrastructure managed by the cloud providers. Scientific Cloud Computing has brought up a lot of advantages (pay-per-use, resource on-demand, high-availability, flexibility, scalability) over the traditional computing models. Traditional computing models, in order to use scientific applications, require in-house infrastructure (servers, storage etc.) and skill to manage this infrastructure, whereas the Scientific Cloud Computing allows the user to focus on applications without worrying about the infrastructure and installations required. Scientific clouds need proper access mechanisms to improve the adoption of such facilities by scientific communities and enhance the usage of scientific clouds. It is very important to have a proper access mechanism in place for Scientific Clouds so as to improve the adoption of such facilities and enhance the usage of cloud.

However, due to the diversity and complexity of services, the requirement for storage and computing capacity for mobile devices is becoming higher and higher. Mobile transparent computing is a fit for this scenario. In mobile transparent computing, the client terminal is rather simple and light-weighted, and the operating systems, applications and user data are all regarded as software resources and stored in the server. The resources required in the user services are dynamically scheduled from the server to run on the client terminal in a streaming-block way via wireless network. In mobile transparent computing, we use the NFS (Network File System) protocol to realize the dynamic scheduling of resources. However, the wireless network environment is complex and unstable, and the wireless packet loss rate is high and the retransmission interval of lost packet is long in mobile transparent computing. In order to improve the scheduling efficiency of users' resources and the NFS performance, we analyze the factors that affect the NFS performance, including NFS read/write block size, wireless bandwidth and so on. We study the effect of bandwidth for the NFS performance when several mobile terminals schedule their resources at the same time. Finally, we improve the NFS performance by setting the optimal block size for read/write, and use TCP as our NFS transmission protocol in mobile transparent computing.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832152","Network File System;block size;mobile devices;transparent computing","Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Operating systems;Protocols;Servers;Wireless networks","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;mobile computing;network operating systems;resource allocation;scheduling;transport protocols","NFS protocol performance analysis;NFS protocol performance improvement;NFS read-write block size;TCP;mobile devices;mobile transparent computing;network file system;operating systems;scheduling efficiency improvement;service complexity;service diversity;smartphone;software resources;tablet;ubiquitous wireless networks;wireless bandwidth","","0","","12","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But, while hardware and networking infrastructure to realize this vision are becoming a reality, precious few applications run in this infrastructure. We believe that this lack of applications stems largely from the fact that it is currently too hard to design, build, and deploy applications in the pervasive computing space. In this paper, we argue that existing approaches to distributed computing are flawed along three axes when applied to pervasive computing; we sketch out alternatives that are better suited for this space. First, application data and functionality need to be kept separate, so that they can evolve gracefully, in a global computing infrastructure. Second, applications need to be able to acquire any resource they need at any time, so that they can continuously provide their services in a highly dynamic environment. Third, pervasive computing requires a common system platform, allowing applications to be run across the range of devices and to be automatically distributed and installed.","","0-7695-1040-X","","10.1109/HOTOS.2001.990075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990075","","Buildings;Computer vision;Electronic mail;Electronic publishing;Face detection;Hardware;Pervasive computing;Space stations;Space technology;Web sites","distributed processing;operating systems (computers);user centred design","application data;common system platform;distributed computing;functionality;global computing infrastructure;pervasive computing;systems directions","","6","4","26","","","20-22 May 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While traditional computing frameworks have failed to provide adequate computing power for the now common data-intensive computing tasks, cloud computing provides an effective alternative to enhance computing power. Machine learning algorithms are powerful analytical methods that allow machines to recognize patterns and facilitate human learning. However, the performance of individual machine learning algorithms within each cloud computing framework remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the lack of a robust selection methodology matching input data with effective machine learning algorithms limits the ability of practitioners to make effective use of cloud computing. This research compares various machine learning algorithms on the widely adopted Apache Mahout framework and the recently introduced GraphLab framework. Whereas previous work has examined the computational architectures of various cloud computing frameworks, this work focuses on a problem-based approach to architecture selection. The experimental results demonstrate that GraphLab generally outperforms Mahout with respect to runtime, scalability, and usability. However, Mahout outperforms GraphLab when the experiment focus shifts to error measurement.","","978-1-4673-5662-6","","10.1109/SIEDS.2013.6549501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549501","","Cloud computing;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement uncertainty;Runtime;Scalability;Twitter","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching","GraphLab framework;cloud computing;computational architecture;data explosion;data intensive computing;data matching;error measurement;human learning;information digitization;machine learning algorithm assessment;pattern recognition;problem-based approach","","0","","23","","","26-26 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One such issue is vendor lock-in, forcing the Cloud users to adhere to one service provider in terms of data and application logic. Semantic Web has been an important research area that has seen significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers. One key property of Semantic Web is the notion of interoperability and portability through high level models. Significant work has been done in the areas of data modeling, matching, and transformations. The issues the Cloud computing community is facing now with respect to portability of data and application logic are exactly the same issue the Semantic Web community has been trying to address for some time.

Common problems that can be solved on the distributed systems include climate/weather modeling, earthquake simulation, evolutionary computing problems and so on. These type of problems may involve billions or even trillions of computations. A single computer is not capable to finish these computations in short span of time, which is typically in days. Distributed computation helps to solve these problems in hours, which could take weeks to solve on a single computer. Distributed computing generally uses the existing resources of the organization. Traffic simulation is the process of simulating transportation systems through software on a virtual road network. Traffic simulation helps in analyzing city traffic at different time intervals of a single day. Common use cases could be analyzing city wide traffic, estimating traffic demand at a particular traffic junction and so on. This paper discusses about the approach to use distributed computing paradigm for optimizing the traffic simulations. Optimizing simulations involves running a number of traffic simulations followed by estimating the nearness of that simulation to the real available traffic data. This real data could be obtained by either manual counting at traffic junctions, or using the probes such as loop inductors, CCTV cameras etc. This distributed computing based approach works to find the best traffic simulation corresponding to the real data in hand, using evolutionary computing technique.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030771","Distributed computing;Evolutionary algorithm;Root Mean Square Error;SUMO;Traffic simulation","Biological cells;Cities and towns;Computational modeling;Computers;Distributed computing;Roads;Vehicles","digital simulation;evolutionary computation;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","climate-weather modeling;distributed computing approach;earthquake simulation;evolutionary computing problems;road traffic simulation;virtual road network","","0","","","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The availability of massive compute power under-utilized by personal computing tasks is a blessing to volunteer computing customers. Meanwhile the reduced performance impact of running a foreign workload, thanks to the increased hardware parallelism, makes volunteering resources more acceptable to PC owners. In addition, we suspect that with aggressive volunteer computing, which assigns foreign tasks to active computers (as opposed to idle ones in the common practice), we can obtain significant energy savings. In this paper, we assess the efficacy of such aggressive volunteer computing model by evaluating the energy saving and performance impact of co-executing resource-intensive foreign workloads with native personal computing tasks. Our results from executing 30 native-foreign workload combinations suggest that aggressive volunteer computing can achieve an average energy saving of around 52% compared to running the foreign workloads on high-end cluster nodes, and around 33% compared to using the traditional, more conservative volunteer computing model.

In this paper we argue that to maximize the environmental benefits of cloud computing, both from the demand as well as the supply point of view, it is necessary to raise the level of abstraction at which cloud services are delivered and consumed. To this end, we introduce the vision of ""Modelling as a Service (MaaS)"" and explain how it provides an essential foundation for reducing the environmental impact of computing services.","","978-1-4577-0879-4","978-0-7695-4461-8","10.1109/SERVICES.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012786","Clouds;Energy efficiency;Green design;Metamodeling;Software engineering","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;DSL;Optimization;Software;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","cloud computing;energy conservation;service-oriented architecture","IT growth;cloud computing infrastructure;cloud service;computing service;environmental impact;modelling as a service","","3","","","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It differs from conventional hard computing (HC) in the sense that, unlike hard computing, it is strongly based on intuition or subjectivity. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and genetic algorithms (GA) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and GA should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. Considering the number of available journal and conference papers on various combinations of these three methods, it is easy to conclude that the fusion of individual soft computing methodologies has already been advantageous in numerous applications. On the other hand, hard computing solutions are usually more straightforward to analyze; their behavior and stability are more predictable; and, the computational burden of algorithms is typically either low or moderate. These characteristics. are particularly important in real-time applications. Thus, it is natural to see SC and HC as potentially complementary methodologies. Novel combinations of different methods are needed when developing high-performance, cost-effective, and safe products for the demanding global market. We present an overview of applications in which the fusion of soft computing and hard computing has provided innovative solutions for challenging real-world problems.

It's easier to trust when you can verify. We took advantage of sealed storage of trust computing to improve traditional trust chain technology in order to provide a dual verifiable trusted bootstrap to make sure each compartment during system bootstrap not to be maliciously changed. We extend trusted chain to memory by developing monitoring tools in privileged domain using features provided by virtual machine monitor to monitor and record runtime states of security critical application in targeted virtual machine instance.

In the broader marketplace, public clouds offer the promise of buying computing capabilities based on a utility model. This utility model enables IT consumers to purchase compute resources on demand to fit current business needs and scale expenses associated with computing resources. Thus, cloud computing offers IT to be treated as an ongoing variable operating expense billed by usage rather than requiring capital expenditures that must be planned years in advance. Advantageously, operating expenses can be charged against the revenue generated by these expenses directly. In contrast, capital expenses incurred by the purchase of a system need to be paid at the time of purchase, but can only be depreciated to reduce the taxable income over the lifetime of the system.","1063-6404","978-1-4673-3051-0","","10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378606","Cloud computing;Infrastructure as a service (IaaS);Platform as a service (PaaS);Software as a service (SaaS);data center management;data center optimization;disaster recovery;high availability;virtual appliance;virtualization","Availability;Cloud computing;Hardware;Servers;Virtual machining","business data processing;cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;resource allocation;taxation;virtualisation","IT consumers;IT industry;broader marketplace;business needs;capital expenses;cloud computing;cloud privacy;computing resources;data center computing;data centers privacy;ongoing variable operating expense;purchase time;revenue generation;taxable income;utility model-based computing capabilities;virtualization","","2","","","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing is ubiquitous, next generation's in-formation technology architecture which offers on-demand access to the network. It is dynamic, virtualized, scalable and pay per use model over internet. In a cloud computing environment, a cloud service provider offers “house of resources” includes applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, data storage and sharing and networking and tries to take up most of the overhead of client. Cloud computing offers lots of benefits, but the journey of the cloud is not very easy. It has several pitfalls along the road because most of the services are outsourced to third parties with added enough level of risk. Cloud computing is suffering from several issues and one of the most significant is Security, privacy, service availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and compliance. Security is a shared responsibility of both client and service provider and we believe security must be information centric, adaptive, proactive and built in.

It is argued that Restful web services provide a natural framework for such asynchronous distributed computing and allow an architecture more suited for on-demand computing. Concretely, the services of the Grid Factory distributed computing system are described. These services are implemented as Apache modules, leveraging Apache APIs for access control and database access.

The computing system consists of many printed circuit boards (PCBs), each containing a modest number of relatively inexpensive field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The PCBs are optically interconnected with an intelligent optical backplane using multiple smart pixel arrays on each PCB. Using current technologies this reconfigurable computing platform can sustain computing rates in the neighborhood of a TeraFlop per second for common scientific algorithms. The major costs of this platform are conservatively estimated at less than $1 Million. In contrast, according to [Patterson and Hennessy] a conventional RISC-based multiprocessor with 1 TeraFlop performance is not cost-effective using current technologies, but may be feasible in the year 2,000 at a cost approaching $100 million if electrical technology continues to mature. Our analysis indicates that a reconfigurable architecture will require one or two orders of magnitude less size (an optical backplane rack versus rows of electronic cabinets) and one or two orders of magnitude less cost than a conventional electronic RISC-based multi-processor architecture.

In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud. Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources.

A computing task may be executed on any one of several computing nodes which possesses the necessary resources. In order to reflect the reality in job scheduling, allocation of network resources for data transfer should be taken into consideration. However, few scheduling methods consider the communication contention on lambda grids. In this paper, we investigate the joint scheduling problem while considering both optical network and computing resources in a lambda grid network. The objective of our work is to maximize the total number of jobs that can be scheduled in a lambda grid network. An adaptive routing algorithm is proposed and implemented for accomplishing the communication tasks for every job submitted in the network. Four heuristics (FIFO, ESTF, LJF, RS) are implemented for job scheduling of the computational tasks.

Network virtualization is being adopted in both telecommunications and the Internet as a key attribute for the next generation networking. Virtualization, as a potential enabler of profound changes in both communications and computing domains, is expected to bridge the gap between these two fields. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), when applied in network virtualization, enables a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm that may greatly facilitate the convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Recently the application of SOA in network virtualization has attracted extensive interest from both academia and industry. Although numerous relevant research works have been published, they are currently scattered across multiple fields in the literature, including telecommunications, computer networking, Web services, and Cloud computing. In this article we present a comprehensive survey on the latest developments in service-oriented network virtualization for supporting Cloud computing, particularly from a perspective of network and Cloud convergence through NaaS. Specifically, we first introduce the SOA principle and review recent research progress on applying SOA to support network virtualization in both telecommunications and the Internet. Then we present a framework of network-Cloud convergence based on service-oriented network virtualization and give a survey on key technologies for realizing NaaS, mainly focusing on state of the art of network service description, discovery, and composition.

The attractiveness of Cloud Computing for HPC is the capability to run large applications on powerful, scalable hardware without needing to actually own or maintain this hardware. Most current research focuses on running HPC applications on the Amazon Cloud Computing platform, which is relatively easy because it supports environments that are similar to existing HPC solutions, such as clusters and supercomputers. In this paper, we evaluate the possibility of using Microsoft Windows Azure as a platform for HPC applications. Since most HPC applications are based on the Unix programming model, their source code has to be ported to the Windows programming model in addition to porting it to the Azure platform. We outline the challenges we encountered during porting applications and their resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a metric to measure the efficiency of Cloud Computing platforms in terms of performance and price. We compared the performance and efficiency of running these benchmarks on a real machine, an Amazon EC2 instance and a Windows Azure instance. Results show that the performance of Azure is close to the performance of running on real machines, and that it is a viable alternative for running HPC applications when compared to other Cloud Computing solutions.","2159-6182","978-1-4673-2892-0","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253582","","Benchmark testing;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Libraries;Measurement;Operating systems;Programming","Unix;cloud computing","Amazon cloud computing platform;HPC;Microsoft Windows Azure;Unix programming model;Windows Azure instance;Windows programming model;cloud computing paradigm;evaluating high performance computing;supercomputers;windows azure platform","","4","","16","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to job grouping, communication of coarse-grained jobs and resources optimizes computation/communication ratio. For this purpose, an algorithm based on both costs with user task grouping is proposed. The proposed scheduling approach in cloud employs an improved cost-based scheduling algorithm for making efficient mapping of tasks to available resources in cloud.

However, security problems still exists in mobile cloud computing (MCC) inherited from cloud computing and mechanisms are needed to cope with these problems. In this paper, we examine various aspects of using BE in MCC to solve security problems: first, we describe the background and related work of BE and MCC, and second we demonstrate several scenarios of deploying BE in MCC. Specifically, we analyze the new critical issues in these situations that can be used by an adversary to disable the operation of cloud computing environment. We then discuss different BE methods that applying in MCC, and explore scenarios where each method shows its strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we address the problem of using BE to protect privacy for users in MCC. Further, we propose an advanced protocol that employ BE for transferring private data in cloud computing environment, and design a conceptual cloud platform supporting biometric authentication to serve as future data center.","","978-0-7695-5058-9","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2013.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623862","Biometric Encryption;Mobile Cloud Computing;Security","Cloud computing;Encryption;Games;Medical services;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;mobile computing","BE methods;MCC user privacy protection;advanced BE protocol;biometric authentication;biometric encryption;biometric identification;cloud computing services;cloud platform;cryptosystems;data center;information security field;mobile Internet;mobile cloud computing environment;mobile terminals;private data;security problems","","2","","15","","","22-23 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the trend that Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has prepared to embrace the cloud concept, there is still no research publication on designing VLSI floorplanning algorithms for a cloud computing platform. This paper proposes the first such algorithm for thermal driven floorplanning. Since existing floorplanning techniques are based on simulated annealing which are sequential algorithms and difficult to parallelize, a new thermal driven floorplanning algorithm is proposed which can be easily parallelized in a cloud computing environment. This algorithm uses an advanced adjacency probability cross entropy optimization and a new integer linear programming based resources provisioning to efficiently use the heterogeneous computation resources and handle the uncertainty of machine waiting time in a cloud. The experimental results on the standard GSRC benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the peak temperature (up to 24C) compared to the simulated annealing technique. In the simulated cloud computing environment, it runs over 30% faster than the simulated annealing technique with moderate overhead in monetary expense due to the fact that the proposed algorithm is parallelization friendly. Further, our algorithm can effectively compute the scheduling solutions considering the uncertainty in waiting time.","2168-6750","","","10.1109/TETC.2015.2443714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7124435","Cloud Computing;Energy-aware Computing;Green Computing;VLSI Design","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Clouds;Computers;Entropy;Optimization","","","","","","","","2015-06-16","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there are at least two challenges to meet the increasing demand. First, the growth in the amount of data far outpaces the computation power growth of a uniprocessor. The growing gap between the supply and demand of computation power forces Enterprises to parallelize their application code. Unfortunately, parallel programming is both time-consuming and error-prone. Second, the emerging Cloud Computing paradigm imposes constraints on the underlying infrastructure, which forces enterprises to rethink their application architecture. We propose the GridBatch system, which aims at solving large-scale data-intensive batch problems under the Cloud infrastructure constraints. GridBatch is a programming model and associated library that hides the complexity of parallel programming, yet it gives the users complete control on how data are partitioned and how computation is distributed so that applications can have the highest performance possible.

Like any other security and correctness sensitive computer system, it is beneficial to fully verify cloud solutions to ensure their correctness. Verification and validation of distributed systems has been widely studied, however, it has not been analyzed whether verification approaches in distributed systems can be directly applied to cloud computing or not. In this study, we present a comparison of verification requirements for distributed computing and cloud computing to establish the need of a specialized verification model/architecture for cloud computing. We differentiate the verification in distributed and cloud systems based on their business models, architecture models, programming models and security models. We argue that service level agreements (SLAs), which span across the cloud, become more critical in the verification process. Based on our study, we present an abstract verification model focusing specifically on cloud computing, paving the way to an implementation of a viable verification model which can practically verify complex cloud systems.","","","","10.1109/CGC.2013.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686021","Cloud computing;service level agreements;verification requirements","Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Programming;Security","business data processing;cloud computing;contracts;formal verification;security of data;service-oriented architecture","SLA;architecture model;business model;distributed computing;distributed system validation;distributed system verification;programming model;secure-reliable cloud computing;security model;service level agreements;verification architecture;verification model;verification requirements","","0","","24","","","Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the hype surrounding cloud computing, customers remain reluctant to deploy their commercial enterprise into the cloud. Nevertheless, lack of protection is the only major concern that hinders increased use of cloud computing. Furthermore, the complexity with which cloud computing manages data secrecy, and information security makes the market hesitant about cloud computing. The architecture of cloud models threatens the security of existing technologies when deployed in a cloud environment. Thus, users of cloud services should know the dangers of uploading data into this new environment.

In this paper, we introduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special) words. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises some (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy transition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology of fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling fuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words.

More and more data-intensive applications are developed in this computing environment. Different applications have different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To continuously support the QoS requirement of an application after data corruption, we propose two QoS-aware data replication (QADR) algorithms in cloud computing systems. The first algorithm adopts the intuitive idea of high-QoS first-replication (HQFR) to perform data replication. However, this greedy algorithm cannot minimize the data replication cost and the number of QoS-violated data replicas. To achieve these two minimum objectives, the second algorithm transforms the QADR problem into the well-known minimum-cost maximum-flow (MCMF) problem. By applying the existing MCMF algorithm to solve the QADR problem, the second algorithm can produce the optimal solution to the QADR problem in polynomial time, but it takes more computational time than the first algorithm. Moreover, it is known that a cloud computing system usually has a large number of nodes. We also propose node combination techniques to reduce the possibly large data replication time. Finally, simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the data replication and recovery.","2168-7161","","","10.1109/TCC.2013.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562695","Cloud computing;data replication;data-intensive application;network flow problem;quality of service","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Radio frequency;Servers;Switches","cloud computing;computational complexity;quality of service;replicated databases;storage management","HQFR;MCMF algorithm;MCMF problem;QADR algorithms;QADR problem;QoS requirements;QoS-aware data replication algorithms;QoS-violated data replicas;cloud computing systems;computational time;computing environment;computing resource;data corruption;data recovery;data replication cost;data-intensive applications;greedy algorithm;high-QoS first-replication;minimum-cost maximum-flow problem;node combination techniques;polynomial time;quality-of-service requirements;storage resource","","3","","","","2013-07-17","Jan.-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the ultimate goals followed in each technology differs from the conceptual view but they both share many ideas that can be mutually exchanged. As the two fields advance they amusingly congregate. The convergence allows faster progress since many shared concepts have been to a great extent solved in the other field. In the pervasive computing environment a balanced distribution of available resources among different tasks is an important task. Devising efficient resource discovery and advertisement algorithms is therefore of much importance. In this article we aim to provide two algorithms for this problem using mobile agents.

We refer to this domain as physical computing systems. For pervasive computing to achieve its promise, developers must create not only high-level system software and application solutions, but also low-level embedded systems solutions.

It is important to evaluate cloud computing environment to predict valid cost to manage the cloud computing system. SimJava and GridSim is well-known simulation tools but they do not support the virtualization of cloud computing. CloudSim is only tool which can evaluate the performance of this environment and it is based on SimJava and GridSim. It is suitable to simulate the situation with large amount of devices and data in cloud computing. Also, it can simulate the virtualization of computing nodes, network devices, and storage units. Service provider has to guarantee quality of service to provide stable related services. For this, we can use the scheduling algorithms. However, there is no consideration of data priority in CloudSim. It is important to support QoS to keep the service level agreement. Thus, it is needed to research a scheduling algorithm to support QoS.

In addition, with the development of economic systems, researchers are employing computational technologies both for computational economic modeling and for the computational solution of analytically and statistically formulated economic problems. Similar to social computing, economic computing is an interdisciplinary area which explores the intersection of computational sciences and economics. It is the key to the development of computational theories, models, and tools that facilitate economic studies, and the design and construct of economic systems using computing technologies. Given the significant growth and maturing of the social and economic computing academic literature, there is a critical need to publish a collection of representative research pieces to provide an integrated and synthesized view of the current state-of-the-art, identify key challenges and opportunities for future studies, and promote community- building among social and economic computing researchers and practitioners.

Hence, it makes the major benefit of adopting cloud-based solutions. Accordingly, there is a need to evaluate the performance of the resource provisioning algorithm adopted by cloud computing platforms. In this paper, an approach for modeling and analyzing the performance of the resource provisioning process in a cloud computing platform is presented. The proposed model utilizes Stochastic Process Algebra (SPA) as an engine to simulate the components involved in the resource provisioning process along with the interactions among them.

With the help of cloud computing, efficient utilization of computing resources is maximized to a great extent. It provides a virtual and programmable infrastructure. Resources are the root of cloud computing, which are provided to the cloud users on demand. As the adaptation of cloud computing is increasing constantly and the end users demand 24/7 access to their services, it becomes a challenge for the cloud service provider to pay deep attention to provide as much reliable services as possible i.e. To provide failure free services. Reliability of a component is the probability of its failure free working. Therefore, reliability of cloud computing depends on the reliability of the individual resources of cloud. So, it is important that reliability of each cloud component must be quantified. In this paper, we have proposed a mechanism for quantifying the reliability of cloud components like virtual machines. Reliability of cloud is dynamic in nature. That is why, its quantification should also be a dynamic process. Reliability of a component can be quantified from its history.

In transparent computing, all software resources (even the OS) are stored on remote servers, from which the clients can request the resources for local execution in a block-streaming way. This paradigm has many benefits including cross-platform experience, user orientation, and platform independence. However, due to its fundamental features, e.g., separation of computation and storage in clients and servers respectively, and block-streaming-based scheduling and execution, transparent computing faces many new security challenges that may become its biggest obstacle. In this paper, we propose a Transparent Computing Security Architecture (TCSA), which builds user-controlled security for transparent computing by allowing the users to configure the desired security environments on demand. We envision, TCSA, which allows the users to take the initiative to protect their own data, is a promising solution for data security in transparent computing.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785334","Transparent computing;security architecture;user-controlled cloud computing","Booting;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Servers","client-server systems;computer network security;data protection;scheduling;software architecture","TCSA;block-streaming-based execution;block-streaming-based scheduling;cross-platform experience;data protection;data security;local execution;network on-demand;platform independence;remote servers;software resources;transparent computing security architecture;user orientation;user-controlled security environments","","0","","21","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As large organizations race to create their million-server warehouses and necessary compute infrastructure to become to early dominators in the cloud market, their high energy consumption and overall environmental impact cannot be neglected.

An enterprise usually store data in internal storage and then tries to protect the data from other outside source. They also provide authentication at certain specific level. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the organizations are slow in accepting it due to security issues and challenges associated with it.

Due to the outsourcing and sharing feature of cloud computing, security is one of the main concerns that hinders the end users to shift their businesses to the cloud. A lot of cryptographic techniques have been proposed to alleviate the data security issues in cloud computing, but most of these works focus on solving a specific security problem such as data sharing, comparison, searching, etc. At the same time, little efforts have been done on program security and formalization of the security requirements in the context of cloud computing. We propose a formal definition of the security of cloud computing, which captures the essence of the security requirements of both data and program. Analysis of some existing technologies under the proposed definition shows the effectiveness of the definition. We also give a simple look-up table based solution for secure cloud computing which satisfies the given definition. As FPGA uses look-up table as its main computation component, it is a suitable hardware platform for the proposed secure cloud computing scheme. So we use FPGAs to implement the proposed solution for k-means clustering algorithm, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","","978-1-4799-5943-3","","10.1109/ReConFig.2014.7032537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032537","","Cloud computing;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Games;Table lookup","Big Data;cloud computing;field programmable gate arrays;pattern clustering;security of data;table lookup","FPGA;LUT based secure cloud computing;big data processing;cryptographic techniques;data security problem;data sharing;formalization;k-means clustering algorithm;look-up table;program security;secure cloud computing scheme;security requirements;suitable hardware platform","","0","","33","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider a fully decentralized resource discovery service based on an unstructured overlay, where the major challenge is to locate desired resources without the global knowledge about sharing resource information. Consequently, more nodes involved in the resource discovery scheme may incur higher network overhead. To achieve an efficient resource discovery, this paper aims to alleviate the network traffic among unstructured information systems. Relying on the information of resource attributes and characteristics, we propose the direction-aware resource discovery scheme to improve the overall performance.

Prior work dealing with Internet-based task computations has either considered only rational, or only malicious and altruistic workers. Altruistic workers always return the correct result of the task, malicious workers always return an incorrect result, and rational workers act based on their self-interest. However, in a massive computation platform, such as the Internet, it is expected that all three type of workers coexist. Therefore, in this work we study Internet-based master-worker computations in the presence of Malicious, Altruistic, and Rational workers. A stochastic distribution of the workers over the three types is assumed. Considering all the three types of workers renders a combination of game-theoretic and classical distributed computing approaches to the design of mechanisms for reliable Internet-based computing. Indeed, in this work, such an algorithmic mechanism that makes use of realistic incentives to obtain the correct task result with a parametrized probability is designed. Only when necessary, the incentives are used to force the rational players to a certain equilibrium (which forces the workers to be truthful) that overcomes the attempts of the malicious workers to deceive the master. Finally, the mechanism is analyzed in two realistic Internet-based master-worker applications. This work is an example of how game theory can be used as a tool to formalize and solve a practical Distributed Computing problem such as Internet supercomputing.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6442-5","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470409","Algorithmic mechanism;Internet-based computing;Rational;Task execution;Volunteering computing;altruistic;malicious processors","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Game theory;Grid computing;Hardware;Internet;Parallel machines;Stochastic processes","Internet;distributed processing;game theory;security of data;stochastic processes","Internet supercomputing;Internet-based computing;Internet-based master-worker computations;Internet-based master-worker computing;Internet-based task computations;algorithmic mechanisms;altruistic workers;distributed computing;game theory;game-theoretic computing;malicious workers;master processor;rational workers;selfish workers;stochastic distribution;untrusted worker processors;untrusted workers","","0","","39","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Symposium on","20070808","2007","","","1","4","Focus on green computing has been growing lately. Green computing refers to supporting business critical computing needs with least possible amount of power or sustainable computing. This represents a dramatic change in priority in IT industry. In the past, the sole focus was on IT equipment processing power and associated equipment spending while infrastructure that includes power, cooling and data center space was always assumed available, ready, a given and affordable. Today, the infrastructure is becoming a limiting factor that can determine how and if IT equipment can be deployed to meet business growth while processing power is becoming a given, even thought not ignored. The driving force behind this change comes from the ever growing business computing needs, fast growing burden of energy cost, growing awareness of global warming issues, and increasing sense of national energy security. On the fronts of global warming issues and energy security, various regulations and laws will soon be in place that will force the use of IT equipment that meet certain energy efficiency requirements. Equally important is the concern for ever growing cost burden for supporting growing business critical computing needs that outpace the infrastructure growth. This paper will provide a review of how IT equipment power consumption across the industry is changing the IT industry priority. It will focus on how equipment power consumption impacts the overall power usage and total cost of ownership and how the power issues may impact what customers may or may not buy and deploy to meet their business needs. It will also briefly cover the general technological trends in the IT industry of what technologies are available in the race to meet green computing requirements.","","1-4244-1253-6","1-4244-1253-6","10.1109/HDP.2007.4283590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4283590","","Apertures;Computer industry;Costs;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Global warming;National security;Packaging;Radio access networks;Space cooling","computer facilities;power aware computing;power consumption","IT equipment power consumption;IT industry;business critical computing;business needs;green computing;power computing;sustainable computing","","10","","14","","","26-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the advent of collaborative computing and data sharing, more and more new modes of interaction have evolved resulting in the need and use of distributed resources. Work within this community has led to the development of Grid technologies, which address precisely these problems. In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect. A recent survey ranked grid computing as sixth on priority lists for IT spending among industry professionals. With this much interest, security becomes necessary to provide authentication, authorization, resource protection, secure communication, data confidentiality, data integrity, trust policies management, user key and credential management, service protection, and network security. This paper provides an insight classification of the different mechanisms and methods of security in grid computing environment, and also discusses the solutions for each category and its limitation in order to define the real problems in grid computing security.

If we follow the time span of this cycle, the next peak is expected to arrive around 2020. With the advancement of computer and communication technologies, a transformation from the current information society to a new society can be perceived which we named as ""Symbiosis Society."" As it is always observed that the invention of new technologies has made a huge impact on our life-style and society. Industrial revolution brings the modern era and the rationality, which consists of higher efficiency, better economy and improved functionality. But in search for a better and convenient life we forget to take care of the universe and its environment. A prime example is the undeniable phenomenon of global warming. In spite of that many developed countries are still reluctant to take bold steps to prevent further deterioration of world atmosphere. In midst of such deliberation, Japan has taken a very courageous step to control the green gas emission to reduce it by 25% within next 10 years. But to achieve this ambitious target to Green, I think we need a new criterion, in addition to the rationality of modern age. None other advancement is as rapid as computer and internet. They had penetrated so much, thus it has become almost impossible to think our life without them. And in future they will only grow wider and faster. We have already witnessed that, invention of new technologies has made a huge impact in our life style and the society itself. Though it may provide various advantages and convenience, at the same time many social problems have also arisen. To solve these problems, we need an additional criterion, which we call' '. We believe that this new criterion along with the existing modern age rationality will lead us to the ultimate success and we can achieve a world which is both technologically efficient and environment - riendly. We call this as Post Modern Society that is Green and Symbiosis Society, which will be realized around year 2020. Present Modern Society is based on ubiquitous information environment, which can be considered as consisting of two computing aspects: Mobile Computing and Pervasive Computing. We then introduced advance ubiquitous computing where human and information systems will co-exist in a cooperative manner to the betterment of life and society, and to alleviate the predefined problems. We proposed a new 3rdaxis, comprised of symbiosis (nature and human) in addition to the existing ubiquitous computing to realize advance ubiquitous computing. By integrating these three axes, we created the Symbiotic Computing paradigm.

Yet portable devices in pervasive computing are mainly powered by batteries and have limited computational and communication capability. Thus the open and dynamic environment in pervasive computing raises challenges in security and trust management. Without trust, pervasive devices cannot cooperate effectively, and the deployment of pervasive computing systems will be restricted to specific application scenarios. The traditional centralized security management schemes are not directly applicable in pervasive computing environments. Moreover, existing user authentication and access control schemes are inadequate to ensure security in pervasive computing. To overcome the limitation of centralized schemes, we need a distributed solution. In this paper, we propose a distributed trust management scheme to ensure security in pervasive computing environments. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the employment of a simple, distributed trust computation and maintenance mechanism to reduce communication and computational overhead without compromising security; (2) the building of an aggregate trust metric that is based on direct observation and indirect observations obtained from neighbors' recommendations. The scheme gives more weight to direct observations and less weight to indirect observations. Every device computes and updates the trust value periodically in a distributed fashion. However, the exchange of trust information is carried out on demand to reduce communication overhead. The operation of the proposed scheme with varying parameter settings is illustrated, using an analytical approach.","0840-7789","1-4244-1020-7","1-4244-1021-5","10.1109/CCECE.2007.311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4232970","","Access control;Authentication;Batteries;Communication system security;Distributed computing;Environmental management;Pervasive computing;Portable computers;Power system management;Power system security","authorisation;ubiquitous computing","access control;communication overhead;computational overhead;distributed trust management;dynamic environment;neighbor recommendation;open environment;pervasive computing environment;pervasive device cooperation;portable devices;security management;trust information;trust metric;ubiquitous computing;user authentication","","5","","11","","","22-26 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework can simulate the mobility and reconnection of mobile or ubiquitous computing devices by using the logical mobility of mobile agent-based emulators. That is, it can test software designed to run on a mobile or ubiquitous device in the same way as if the software were disconnected from the network, moved with the device, and reconnected to and executed on another network.

The basic requirements of cloud are to meet the various needs of enterprise organizations such as scalability, adaptability, extensibility and manageability. The biggest visible change the cloud computing has made in the scenario of computing is moving the data center offsite to a third party and buying services rather than maintaining onsite applications directly. By its use companies can save money on operational costs and they can focus on their core business instead of being worried about different IT obstacles. Moreover true portability is provided by cloud by enabling access to applications and documents anywhere in the world via the internet through commodity hardware only.

To address these issues, we have designed and implemented C-Meter, which is a portable, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for generating and submitting test workloads to computing clouds.

Leveraging idle workstations is a feasible method to meet the processing challenge. Grid computing, a new computing infrastructure, provides a potential solution to harness idle workstations and other resources in a flexible manner. This paper describes our research on using grid computing to support near real-time geospatial applications with near real-time routing as an example.

Cloud exploitation by mobile devices breeds a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However, issues like portability and interoperability should be addressed for mobile augmentation which is a non-trivial task using component-based approaches. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising design philosophy embraced by mobile computing and cloud computing communities to stimulate portable, complex application using prefabricated building blocks called Services. Utilizing distant cloud resources to host and run Services is hampered by long WAN latency. Exploiting mobile devices in vicinity alleviates long WAN latency, while creates new set of issues like Service publishing and discovery as well as clientserver security, reliability, and Service availability. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented architecture based on SOA to stimulate publishing, discovering, and hosting Services on nearby mobiles, which reduces long WAN latency and creates a business opportunity that encourages mobile owners to embrace Service hosting. Group of mobile phones simulate a nearby cloud computing platform. We create new role of Service host by enabling unskilled mobile owners/users to host Services developed by skilled developers. Evidently, Service availability, reliability, and Service-oriented mobile application portability will increase towards green ubiquitous computing in our mobile cloud infrastructure.","","978-1-4673-2996-5","978-1-4673-2995-8","10.1109/ICCCW.2012.6316481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316481","","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Security;Service oriented architecture;Smart phones","cloud computing;computer network reliability;computer network security;mobile computing;open systems;service-oriented architecture;smart phones;telecommunication services;wide area networks","MOMCC;SOA;client-server security;component-based approach;green ubiquitous computing;interoperability;long WAN latency;market-oriented architecture;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;reliability;service availability;service discovery;service host;service oriented architecture;service publishing;smartphone","","1","","18","","","15-17 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this generation change we can access data wirelessly anywhere anytime using mobile internet. In 1991, Mark Weiser depicted an idea about the 21<sup>st</sup> century computing that explains the ubiquity of personal computers. He explained in his paper “the computer for the twenty first century” defines pervasive computing as a technology that “weaves itself into the fabric of everyday life until it is indistinguishable from it”. He also explained that for the successful operation of pervasive computing we need it to be functioning transparent to the user. In recent years, the rapid development in the area of embedded system, wireless networks and mobile computing has turned theoretical pervasive computing into practical possibility. In order to provide universal computing environment, it is also going through many challenges like effective context awareness, its architectural study, various faults and failures (hardware, network, software) etc. In this paper, we introduce middleware services in between the session management scenario to provide the QoS by sensing the flow of data packet in between client side application and application server. It helps to achieve reliability and scalability in between the services. In this paper, we will describe our proposed middleware role to provide QoS in pervasive computing.

This paper studies the application of Gang Scheduling on a Cloud Computing model, based on the architecture of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The study takes into consideration both performance and cost while integrating mechanisms for job migration and handling of job starvation. The number of Virtual Machines (VMs) available at any moment is dynamic and scales according to the demands of the jobs being serviced. The aforementioned model is studied through simulation in order to analyze the performance and overall cost of Gang Scheduling with migrations and starvation handling.

With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, this pool of users are now more global than any-time in the past The resource demand of these users are inadvertently governed by strict “service level agreements”. In this paradigm, data centers' operational energy costs are a rising concern as they continue an upward trend that is poised to surpass the capital cost of equipment in a typical lifetime usage model. A data center is a complex distributed system comprised of a hierarchy of numerous components; and operating at multitude levels of usage abstractions. Virtualization is an approach to consolidating multiple services onto a smaller number of computing resources. A virtualized server environment allows computing resources to be shared among multiple performance-isolated platforms called virtual machines. Virtual Machine(VM) technology has been widely applied in data center environments due to its seminal features, including reliability, flexibility, and the ease of management. We define set of service-provider controllable policies comprising of number of physical servers, possible number of VMs, possible VM request queue length and maximum number of requests per VM threshold. For each of these defined policy, we implement a dynamic resource provisioning framework for virtualized server environment which achieves power efficiency by using optimum power efficient allocation and workload forecasting scheme to ensure that workload request meet the defined SLAs and the data center operates with least power consumption. Finally, based on the results from our implementation, we analyze and infer on the best policy which meets SLA commitments and has the least energy consumption.","","978-1-4244-9393-7","","10.1109/ICCCET.2011.5762447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762447","cloud computing;power aware provisioning","Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Power demand;Servers;Silicon;Switches;Virtual machining","Poisson distribution;client-server systems;cloud computing;power aware computing;power consumption;queueing theory;resource allocation;virtual machines","IT computing;Poisson distribution;cloud computing environment;computing resource aggregation;computing resource sharing;data center operational energy costs;data centers;distributed system;dynamic resource provisioning;equipment capital cost;lifetime usage model;power aware provisioning;power consumption;power efficiency;request queue length;resource demand;service level agreement;service-provider controllable policies;usage abstraction;virtual machines;virtualized server environment;workload forecasting;workload request","","3","","11","","","18-19 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the sake of efficient resource utilization, Load Balancing System problem needs more attention in cloud computing. In This paper, we have used Agent Based Dynamic Load Balancing (ABDLB) approach in which mobile agent plays very important role, which is a software entity and usually defined as an independent software program that runs on behalf of a network administrator.

The development environment for applications on these large computing systems is not unified. Typically, a developer uses VHDL simulation and synthesis tools to program the FPGAs on the adaptive computing boards. External control for the board, such as downloading new configurations or setting clock speeds, is provided through a vendor-specific API. This API is typically accessed in a C host program that the developer must write in a high-level language environment.

Cloud computing is an outgrowth of the ease-of-access to remote computing sites provided by the Internet. Instead of installing a suite of software for each computer, we'd only have to load one application. That application would allow workers to log into a Web-based service which hosts all the programs the user would need for his or her job. Remote machines owned by another company would run everything from e-mail to word processing to complex data analysis programs. It's called cloud computing, and it could change the entire computer industry. In a cloud computing system, there's a significant workload shift. Local computers no longer have to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to running applications. The network of computers that make up the cloud handles them instead. Hardware and software demands on the user's side decrease. The only thing the user's computer needs to be able to run is the cloud computing systems interface software, which can be as simple as a Web browser, and the cloud's network takes care of the rest.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679897","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679897","","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computational modeling;Computers;Servers;Software","cloud computing;data analysis;online front-ends","Internet;Web browser;Web-based service;cloud computing system;complex data analysis programs;computer industry;computer resources;e-mail;interface software;remote computing sites;remote machines;word processing","","8","","18","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, cloud computing offers everyone sophisticated computing infrastructures and resources as utilities, so that individual users with relatively low computing knowledge can have at their disposal a high performing computing infrastructure with little investment. Together, these two complementary technological advances form the backbone of our digitized world, when coupled with the rise of sensors,mobile devices and the internet of things. Of course, they also face significant challenges. These articles look at each area and describe how they complement each other.

The main idea of the proposed mechanism is to classify the attributes of computing resources into two groups: a static attribute group and a dynamic attribute group. The attributes classified into the static attribute group are managed in a centralized manner, while the attributes in the dynamic attribute group are managed in a decentralized manner. In resource searching, this hybrid-type resource management mechanism can limit the candidates based on the static attributes firsts, and then the appropriate resources can be searched according to the dynamic attributes only within the area restricted by the static attributes. Therefore, the mechanism can prevent the network traffic explosion due to the flooding search in native P2P systems. Performance evaluation is carried out theoretically and experimentally. The results of theoretical evaluation indicate that the proposed model is well-suited for the resource search required by the ubiquitous computing, compared with both a typical server-client model and a P2P-based model. Prototyping the proposed mechanism experimentally shows its feasibility","","0-7695-2508-3","","10.1109/SAINT.2006.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1581310","","Computer networks;Explosions;IP networks;Peer to peer computing;Pervasive computing;Prototypes;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Ubiquitous computing","Internet;ad hoc networks;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;ubiquitous computing","Internet;P2P ad-hoc networking;computing resource search;hybrid-type resource management;peer-to-peer;ubiquitous computing system","","1","","20","","","23-27 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major security issue of cloud computing is that the cloud provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure, and that prevent illegal data accesses from outsiders, other clients, or even the unauthorized cloud employees. In this paper, we deal with cloud security services including key agreement and authentication. By using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and symmetric bivariate polynomial based secret sharing, we design the secure cloud computing (SCC). Two types of SCC are proposed. One requires a trusted third party (TTP), and the other does not need a TTP. Also, our SCC can be extended to multi-server SCC (MSCC) to fit an environment, where each multi-server system contains multiple servers to collaborate for serving applications. Due to the strong security and operation efficiency, the proposed SCC and MSCC are extremely suitable for use in cloud computing.","","978-0-7695-5010-7","","10.1109/ISBAST.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597700","authentication;cloud computing;homomorphism;key agreement;secret sharing;symmetric bivariate polynomial","Authentication;Cloud computing;Cryptography;Polynomials;Protocols;Servers","cloud computing;data privacy;public key cryptography","ECDH;Internet-based computing;MSCC;TTP;authentication;cloud security services;data privacy protection;data security;elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman;key agreement;multiserver SCC;secure cloud computing;symmetric bivariate polynomial based secret sharing;trusted third party","","0","","26","","","2-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we propose a MapReduce-based image-conversion module in cloud computing environment in order to reduce the burden of computing power. The proposed module consists of two parts: a storage system, i.e., Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) for image data and a MapReduce program with a Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library for image transcoding. It can process image data in distributed and parallel cloud computing environments, thereby minimizing the computing infrastructure overhead.

However, with today's rapidly growing data volume and task complexity, it is increasingly hard for individual workstations to meet the demands of interactive scientific data processing. The increasing cost of such interactive processing is hindering the productivity of end-to-end scientific computing workflows. While existing distributed computing systems allow people to aggregate desktop workstation resources for parallel computing, the burden of explicit parallel programming and parallel job execution often prohibits scientists to take advantage of such platforms. In this paper, we discuss the need for transparent desktop parallel computing in scientific data processing. As an initial step toward this goal, we present our on-going work on the automatic parallelization of the scripting language R, a popular tool for statistical computing.

The system utilised routinely available information in healthcare settings as the minimum dataset. The UNU-IIGH has devised the UNU Casemix Grouper that is currently being used as the casemix grouping engine in a number of developing countries. In the next stage of development, UNU-IIGH plans to deploy the system using the cloud computing platform. The term “cloud computing” denotes the use of Internet-based computers for a variety of computing application services known as Software as a Service (SaaS). As definitions evolve and refine, cloud computing now implies the move away from centralised computing applications into remote applications running in a “cloud” of computers. Users of cloud computing are not concerned with the inner workings of the remote application and only “see” and “use” the services being requested, without control of the technology infrastructure to make it happen. It is envisaged that through cloud computing, the users of the UNU Casemix Grouper will not be overburdened with the initial capital cost for the infrastructure development required for using the casemix grouper. With cloud architecture, the UNU grouper would be able to support the implementation of casemix system to a wider audience especially in developing countries with limited local IT infrastructure. This will ensure that developing countries with limited development budget and basic IT infrastructure has access to much-needed tools like casemix grouper; as well as introduce much needed financial efficiency and clinical quality to their healthcare system.

Cloud computing has made hosting and deployment of computing resources cheaper and easier with no up-front charges but pay per-use flexible payment methods. However, there is lack of tools to aid decision makers in evaluating the much promised benefits of cloud computing particularly its cost benefit. To fill this gap in tools for evaluating the cost benefit of cloud services as an alternative to on-premise computing, a cost modelling system for cloud computing (CCMS) is proposed. A prototype model was developed to simulate the cost incurred on maintaining an on-premise IT infrastructure under various usage patterns with the purpose of determining the cost benefit of cloud alternatives. CCMS assists decision makers with insights on cost savings of adopting cloud alternatives, plan computing budgets and also demonstrate how the utilization capacity and cost of acquisition of an infrastructure can influence the cost savings from cloud alternatives.","","","","10.1109/ICCSA.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976666","Web application;cloud analyst;cloud computing;cloud costing;cloud modelling;cloud simulator;cost model;utilization model","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Maintenance engineering;Organizations","cloud computing;cost-benefit analysis;software cost estimation","IT infrastructure;cloud computing modelling system;cloud services;cost benefit;cost modelling system;cost savings;infrastructure acquisition cost;usage patterns;utilization capacity","","0","","39","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

P2P cloud computing networks are unstructured and are an important component to implement next generation internet. How to quickly and efficiently search the resources in P2P networks has become one of the most critical issues, and it is one of the greatest concerns to users. This paper first describes the basic flooding P2P network search method, which is from the analyzing the pros and cons of several new search methods. After that, a cache-based search algorithm is proposed: When a node of the remaining load capacity is high, it will become the center node and form a joint topology area with the nearby nodes together, then the center node and ordinary nodes also need to store the index cache. At the local region the overheating resources will be copied to the local (that is, the contents cache). The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the hit rates of resources searching, and reduce the query delay in cloud computing networks.","1530-2075","978-1-61284-425-1","978-0-7695-4577-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009000","","Algorithm design and analysis;Indexes;Joints;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Topology","cache storage;cloud computing;next generation networks;peer-to-peer computing;search problems","P2P cloud computing networks;P2P networks;P2P technology;cache-based search algorithm;center node;cloud computing distributed network applications;cloud computing technology;flooding P2P network search method;index cache;joint topology area;load capacity;next generation Internet;overheating resources;peer-to-peer cloud computing networks;peer-to-peer networks;query delay;search methods","","1","","13","","","16-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact implies that existing certification schemes do not provide support for dynamic changes of components as required in Cloud Computing scenarios. In existing certification schemes certificates refer to a particular version of the product or system, changes in the system structure require a process of recertification. We propose a solution based on the combination of software certification techniques and hardware-based certification, as those provided by the Trusted Computing technology. Likewise, the main target of our approach is bringing the gap existing between the software certification and the means for hardware certification, in order to provide a solution for the whole system certification using Trusted Computing technology.","","978-0-7695-5024-4","","10.1109/SERVICES.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6655682","certification; cloud computing; security; trusted computing technology","Certification;Cloud computing;Computers;Hardware;Security;Service-oriented architecture","certification;cloud computing;security of data;trusted computing","cloud computing security;hardware-based certification;security properties;software security certification schemes;trusted computing technology","","1","","24","","","June 28 2013-July 3 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These resource constrained edge environments are characterized by dynamic context, limited computing resources, high levels of stress, and intermittent network connectivity. Cyber-foraging is the leverage of external resource-rich surrogates to augment the capabilities of resource-limited devices. In cloudlet-based cyber-foraging, resource-intensive computation and data is offloaded to cloudlets. Forward-deployed, discoverable, virtual-machine-based tactical cloudlets can be hosted on vehicles or other platforms to provide infrastructure to offload computation, provide forward data staging for a mission, perform data filtering to remove unnecessary data from streams intended for dismounted users, and serve as collection points for data heading for enterprise repositories. This paper describes tactical cloudlets and presents experimentation results for five different cloudlet provisioning mechanisms. The goal is to demonstrate that cyber-foraging in tactical environments is possible by moving cloud computing concepts and technologies closer to the edge so that tactical cloudlets, even if disconnected from the enterprise, can provide capabilities that can lead to enhanced situational awareness and decision making at the edge.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956959","cloud computing;cloudlets;edge computing;mobile cloud computing;mobile computing;tactical cloudlets","Cloud computing;IP networks;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Payloads;Runtime;Servers","cloud computing;decision making;military computing;personnel;virtual machines","cloud computing;cyber-foraging;decision making;dynamic context;front-line personnel;intermittent network connectivity;limited computing resources;situational awareness;soldiers;tactical cloudlets;tactical environments;virtual machine","","0","","16","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software failures. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in production clouds, especially for newly managed or deployed systems. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Failure Detection (AFD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. AFD employs data description using hypersphere for adaptive failure detection. Based on the cloud performance data, AFD detects possible failures, which are verified by the cloud operators. They are confirmed as either true failures with failure types or normal states. AFD adapts itself by recursively learning from these newly verified detection results to refine future detections. Meanwhile, AFD exploits the observed but undetected failure records reported by the cloud operators to identify new types of failures. We have implemented a prototype of the AFD system and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment. Our experimental results show that AFD can achieve more efficient and accurate failure detection than other existing schemes.","1097-2641","978-1-4673-4881-2","","10.1109/PCCC.2012.6407740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407740","Autonomic management;Cloud computing;Dependable systems;Failure detection;Learning algorithms","Cloud computing;Detectors;Equations;Kernel;Measurement;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fault diagnosis;fault tolerant computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","AFD framework;adaptive failure detection system;autonomic failure detection;cloud execution monitoring;cloud operators;data description;hardware failures;hypersphere;normal states;on-campus cloud computing environment;production cloud computing system infrastructures;recursive learning;runtime cloud performance data collection;self-managing cloud resources;software failures;system-level cloud dependability assurance;true failure types;unlabeled data","","0","","51","","","1-3 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the need for energy saving and also the presence of asymmetric features in a mobile computing environment, the conventional query processing for a distributed database cannot be directly applied to a mobile computing system. In this paper, we first explore three asymmetric features of a mobile environment. Then, in light of these features, we devise query processing methods for both join and query processing. Intuitively, employing semijoin operations in a mobile computing environment is able to further reduce both the amount of data transmission and energy consumption. A semijoin which is initiated by a mobile computer (respectively, the server) and is beneficial to reduce the cost of a join operation is termed a mobile-initiated or MI (respectively, server-initiated or SI) profitable semijoin. According to those asymmetric features of a mobile computing system, we examine three different join methods and devise some specific criteria to identify MI/SI profitable semijoins. For query processing, which refers to the processing of multijoin queries, we develop three query processing schemes. In particular, we formulate the query processing in a mobile computing system as a two-phase query processing procedure that can determine a join sequence and interleave that join sequence with SI profitable semijoins to reduce both the amount of data transmission and energy consumption. Performance of these join and query methods is comparatively analyzed and sensitivity analysis on several parameters: is conducted. Furthermore, we develop a systematic procedure to derive the characteristic functions of MI and SI profitable semijoins. It is noted that, given some system parameters, those characteristic functions are very important in determining which join method is the most appropriate one to employ in that configuration. It is shown by our simulation results that, by exploiting the three asymmetric features, these characteristic functions are very powerful in reducing both the amounts of energy consumption and data transmission incurred and can- lead to the design of an efficient and effective query processing procedure for a mobile computing environment.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432706","Index Terms- Mobile database;join method.;mobile computing;query processing","Costs;Data communication;Distributed computing;Distributed databases;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Performance analysis;Query processing;Sensitivity analysis;Spatial databases","distributed databases;mobile computing;query processing","data transmission;distributed database;energy consumption;mobile computers;mobile computing environment asymmetry;mobile database;mobile-initiated profitable semijoin;sensitivity analysis;server-initiated profitable semijoin;static servers;two-phase query processing;wireless computers","","2","","31","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two types of grids are designed, the computing grid and data grid, in the proposed environment. All grids are installed with full functions, each of which is wrapped by Globus toolkit. Grid services are invoked by the users or other grids and able to respond to the invoking side. There are 10 computers serving as grid nodes each of which is equipped with different hardware components and is distributed on two campuses.

In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving opportunistic computing framework, called SPOC, for m-Healthcare emergency. With SPOC, smart phone resources including computing power and energy can be opportunistically gathered to process the computing-intensive personal health information (PHI) during m-Healthcare emergency with minimal privacy disclosure. In specific, to leverage the PHI privacy disclosure and the high reliability of PHI process and transmission in m-Healthcare emergency, we introduce an efficient user-centric privacy access control in SPOC framework, which is based on an attribute-based access control and a new privacy-preserving scalar product computation (PPSPC) technique, and allows a medical user to decide who can participate in the opportunistic computing to assist in processing his overwhelming PHI data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed SPOC framework can efficiently achieve user-centric privacy access control in m-Healthcare emergency. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the SPOC's effectiveness in term of providing high-reliable-PHI process and transmission while minimizing the privacy disclosure during m-Healthcare emergency.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200265","Mobile-healthcare emergency;PPSPC;opportunistic computing;user-centric privacy access control","Access control;Medical services;Monitoring;Privacy;Protocols;Reliability;Smart phones","authorisation;body sensor networks;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;smart phones","BSN;PHI privacy disclosure;PHI process reliability;PPSPC technique;SPOC framework;attribute-based access control;computing energy;computing power;computing-intensive personal health information;health monitoring;healthcare provider;high-reliable-PHI process;high-reliable-PHI transmission;m-Healthcare emergency;medical user;minimal privacy disclosure;mobile healthcare emergency;opportunistic computing;performance evaluations;pervasive environment;privacy-preserving scalar product computation technique;secure and privacy-preserving opportunistic computing framework;security analysis;smart phone pervasiveness;smart phone resources;user-centric privacy access control;wireless body sensor networks","","9","","33","","2012-05-15","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Transparent Computing paradigm separates the storages and executions of software programs and data including what of operating systems in different computers connecting with communication networks. In this paradigm, data and programs are stored in the storage servers and they are executed in either clients or execution servers according to the required services, respectively.

"Formal Specification and Runtime Detection of Dynamic Properties in Asynchronous Pervasive Computing Environments","Yiling Yang; Yu Huang; Jiannong Cao; Xiaoxing Ma; Jian Lu","Dept. of Comput.

Due to the intrinsic dynamism of the pervasive computing environment, dynamic properties, which delineate concerns of context-aware applications on the temporal evolution of the environment state, are of great importance. However, detection of dynamic properties is challenging, mainly due to the intrinsic asynchrony among computing entities in the pervasive computing environment. Moreover, the detection must be conducted at runtime in pervasive computing scenarios, which makes existing schemes do not work. To address these challenges, we propose the property detection for asynchronous context (PDAC) framework, which consists of three essential parts: 1) Logical time is employed to model the temporal evolution of environment state as a lattice. The active surface of the lattice is introduced as the key notion to model the runtime evolution of the environment state; 2) Specification of dynamic properties is viewed as a formal language defined over the trace of environment state evolution; and 3) The SurfMaint algorithm is proposed to achieve runtime maintenance of the active surface of the lattice, which further enables runtime detection of dynamic properties. A case study is conducted to demonstrate how the PDAC framework enables context awareness in asynchronous pervasive computing scenarios. The SurfMaint algorithm is implemented and evaluated over MIPA - the open-source context-aware middleware we developed. Performance measurements show the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of SurfMaint, even when faced with dynamic changes in the asynchronous pervasive computing environment.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295610","Context;Dynamic property;Formal languages;Heuristic algorithms;Labeling;Lattices;Pervasive computing;Runtime;asynchrony;context awareness;lattice;predicate detection","Context;Formal languages;Heuristic algorithms;Labeling;Lattices;Pervasive computing;Runtime","formal specification;middleware;public domain software;ubiquitous computing","MIPA;PDAC;SurfMaint algorithm;asynchronous pervasive computing environments;context-aware applications;contextual properties;dynamic properties;formal specification;intrinsic dynamism;open-source context-aware middleware;property detection for asynchronous context framework;runtime detection;temporal environment state evolution","","2","","40","","2012-09-05","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This issue is especially difficult since cloud computing relies by nature on a highly dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a model based Byzantine fault detection technique for cloud computing. A cloud computing fault net (CFN) is used to precisely model the different components of cloud computing, such as service resources, cloud module, the detection and failure process, etc, the basic properties of the constructed model are analyzed. Based on this, the fault detection strategy is proposed, which can dynamically detect the fault of cloud application in the execution process. The operational semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove its effectiveness and correctness.

These infrastructures successfully merged physical and digital entities in an environment to create aware homes, smart offices and active spaces. In recent years, ad-hoc pervasive computing has attracted attention with the proliferation of low cost, short-range wireless devices. Ad-hoc pervasive computing does not assume digital devices to be tied to physical environments and aims to create digital ""clusters"" that can be viewed as a unified entity. The user can program this cluster of devices with a single programming interface. In this paper, AVC introduce our middleware, called Mobile Gaia, for ad-hoc pervasive computing. Mobile Gaia is a services-based middleware that integrates resources of various devices. It manages several functions such as forming and maintaining device collections, sharing resources among devices and enables seamless service interactions. It also provides an application framework to develop applications for the device collection. The application framework decomposes the application into smaller components that can run on different devices in this collection.

Especially in pervasive computing that is characterized by disconnected operation and mobility, the process of using service specifications and dynamic binding becomes critical. In this paper, we summarize our ongoing work in the area of integrating service orientation into pervasive computing using the notion of specifying service requirements and using these specifications to bind to the available resources dynamically instead of hardwiring them statically. We term these specifications programmable requirements since they can be interpreted at run time to bind to a resource satisfying those specifications. Interestingly this approach also satisfies the basis for two key types of adaptation prevalent in pervasive computing systems - functional and architectural - as we show in this paper.","","0-7695-2315-3","","10.1109/ITCC.2005.280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425159","Adaptation;Ontologies;Pervasive Computing;Programmable Requirements;Service-Oriented Computing","Airports;Application software;Computer interfaces;Context-aware services;Ontologies;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Quality of service;Runtime;Unified modeling language","formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);ubiquitous computing","dynamic binding;pervasive computing;programmable requirements;service specification;service-oriented computing","","16","","22","","","4-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Job scheduling in computing grid is a very important problem. Current scientific applications become more complex and need huge computing power and storage space. It may take a very long time to complete a complicated job. However, to utilize grids, we need an efficient job scheduling algorithm to assign jobs to resources in grids. In this paper, we propose a Balanced Ant Colony Optimization (BACO) algorithm for job scheduling in the Grid environment. There are two schemes introduced in this paper regarding local and global pheromone update.

The former feature reduces the variation of the execution times for individual tasks, which are usually aggravated by dynamic and unpredictable load changes on volunteer computing resources. The latter offers another way to assign tasks to idle computing resources when the BOINC project server fails in the task assignment. Using a prototype implementation, this paper examines the effect of the proposed mechanism on the performance of a real volunteer computing system.

However, new software architectures and deployment algorithms are still required to fully exploit virtualization in web platforms used for scientific computing, commonly called science gateways. We propose a software architecture and an algorithm to enable and optimize the deployment of virtual machines on clusters and clouds in science gateways. Our architecture is based on 3 design principles: (i) separation between resource provisioning and task scheduling (ii) encapsulation of VMs in regular computing tasks (iii) association of a virtual computing site to each disk image. Our algorithm submits and removes VMs on clusters and clouds based on the current system workload, the number of available job slots in active VMs, the cost and current performance of clouds clusters, and a parameter quantifying the performance-cost trade-off. To cope with variable queuing and booting times, it replicates VMs on independent computing sites selected from a minimization of a make span-cost linear combination in the Pareto set of non-dominated solutions. Make span and cost are estimated from the last measured queuing, booting, and task execution times, using an exponential model of the gain yielded by VM replication. We implement this algorithm in CBRAIN, a science gateway widely used for neuroimaging, and we evaluate it on an infrastructure of 2 clusters and 1 cloud. Results show that it is able to reach some points of the performance-cost trade-off associated to VM deployment.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846474","Cloud;Clusters;Multi-objective optimization;Science gateways;Software architecture;Virtual machines","Booting;Clouds;Clustering algorithms;Logic gates;Monitoring;Portals;Virtual machining","Pareto optimisation;cloud computing;distributed algorithms;medical computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines;virtualisation;workstation clusters","CBRAIN scientific computing;Pareto set;VM deployment;cloud clusters;cloud infrastructures;deployment algorithms;deployment optimization;distributed computing;hardware virtualization;make span-cost linear combination;neuroimaging;resource provisioning;resource scaling;software customization;task scheduling;virtual computing;virtual machine deployment","","0","","34","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through designing the broadcast messages for available terminals discovery and unicast messages for remote registration, the model implements remote registration of Context Database Agents, and builds up an architecture for sharing and fusing of contexts in a peer-to-peer ubiquitous computing environment to satisfy the requirements of sentient computing applications. In contrast with some current context management systems, the PCSM model partly solves the inherent problem of high cost for communication and storage redundancy through the mechanism of optimization.

Services in the cloud computing networks may be virtualized with specific servers which host abstracted details. Some of the servers are active and available, while others are busy or heavy loaded, and the remaining are offline for various reasons. Users would expect the right and available servers to complete their application requirements. Therefore, in order to provide an effective control scheme with parameter guidance for cloud resource services, failure detection is essential to meet users' service expectations. It can resolve possible performance bottlenecks in providing the virtual service for the cloud computing networks. Most existing Failure Detector (FD) schemes do not automatically adjust their detection service parameters for the dynamic network conditions, thus they couldn't be used for actual application. This paper explores FD properties with relation to the actual and automatic fault-tolerant cloud computing networks, and find a general non-manual analysis method to self-tune the corresponding parameters to satisfy user requirements. Based on this general automatic method, we propose specific and dynamic Self-tuning Failure Detector, called SFD, as a major breakthrough in the existing schemes. We carry out actual and extensive experiments to compare the quality of service performance between the SFD and several other existing FDs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can automatically adjust SFD control parameters to obtain corresponding services and satisfy user requirements, while maintaining good performance. Such an SFD can be extensively applied to industrial and commercial usage, and it can also significantly benefit the cloud computing networks.","1530-2075","978-1-4673-0975-2","","10.1109/IPDPS.2012.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6267868","Application requirements;Cloud computing service;Fault tolerance;Quality of service;Self-tuning failure detection","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer crashes;Delay;Education;Heart beat;Quality of service","cloud computing;software fault tolerance;system recovery","FD;automatic fault-tolerant cloud computing networks;cloud computing networks;cloud computing service;dynamically scalable cloud networks;failure detector;host abstracted details;nonmanual analysis method;self tuning failure detection scheme;virtual service","","2","","41","","","21-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

J. Siegel. What does it mean for a computer system to be ""robust""? How can robustness be described? How does one determine if a claim of robustness is true? How can one decide which of two systems is more robust? Often people state that their system software component, piece of hardware, application code, or technique is ""robust,"" but never define what they mean by ""robust."" How does one determine if a claim of robustness is true when it is not defined? Furthermore, without a definition, robustness cannot be quantified, so if two people claim to have robust computing systems, for example, how can one decide which is the more robust? These are the types of issues we address in this keynote presentation. We study robustness in the context of resource allocation in heterogeneous parallel and distributed computing systems, but the robustness concepts presented have broad applicability. In heterogeneous parallel and distributed computing environments, a collection of different machines is interconnected and provides a variety of computational capabilities. These capabilities can be used to execute a workload composed of different types of applications, each of which may consist of multiple tasks, where the tasks have diverse computational requirements. The execution times of a task may vary from one machine to the next, and just because some machine A is faster than some machine B for task 1 does not mean it will be faster for task 2. Furthermore, there can be inter-task data dependencies. Tasks must share the computing and communication resources of the system. A critical research problem is how to allocate resources to tasks to optimize some performance objective. However, systems frequently have degraded performance due to uncertainties, such as unexpected machine failures, changes in system workload, or i- naccurate estimates of system parameters. It is important for system performance to be robust against uncertainties. To accomplish this, we present a stochastic model for deriving the robustness of a resource allocation. This model assumes that stochastic (experiential) information is available about the values of these parameters whose actual values are uncertain. The robustness of a resource allocation is quantified as the probability that a user-specified level of system performance can be met. We present this stochastic robustness model and show how to use it to compare different resource allocations. It will be demonstrated how this model can be incorporated into resource management heuristics that produce robust allocations to optimize some user-specified performance criterion. Robust resource allocation heuristics for an example environment will be discussed and compared. The stochastic robustness analysis approach can be applied to a variety of computing and communication system environments, including parallel, distributed, cluster, grid, Internet, cloud, embedded, multicore, content distribution networks, wireless networks, and sensor networks. Furthermore, the robustness model is generally applicable to design problems throughout various scientific and engineering fields.","","978-1-4244-5403-7","","10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381987","","Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Parallel processing;Resource management;Robustness;Stochastic processes;System performance;System software;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","parallel processing;resource allocation;stochastic processes","content distribution networks;heterogeneous parallel computing systems;parallel-distributed computing;resource allocation;robust computing systems;sensor networks;stochastic model;stochastically robust resource management;system software component;wireless networks","","0","","","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, with the introduction and rising use of mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable attention since the IoT has brought physical devices and connected them to the Internet, enabling each device to share data with surrounding devices and virtualized technologies in real-time. Consequently, the exploding data usage requires a new, innovative computing platform that can provide robust real-time data analytics and resource provisioning to clients. As a result, fog computing has recently been introduced to provide computation, storage and networking services between the end-users and traditional cloud computing data centers. This paper proposes a policy-based management of resources in fog computing, expanding the current fog computing platform to support secure collaboration and interoperability between different user-requested resources in fog computing.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051866","","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Global Positioning System;Security;Vehicles","Internet of Things;cloud computing;computer centres;open systems;resource allocation;security of data","Internet of things;IoT;cloud computing data centers;dynamic user demands;elastic resources provisioning;exploding data usage;fog computing;interoperability;networking services;on-demand data access;policy-driven security management;real-time data analytics;secure collaboration;storage services;ubiquitous data access;user-requested resources;virtualized technologies","","0","","13","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This tutorial introduces fundamental principles of grid computing and computational economy and discusses how they impact on emerging computational and data grid technologies. It identifies resource management challenges and introduces new challenges and requirements introduced by the grid economy on grid service providers (GSPs) and grid service consumers. The tutorial presents a service-oriented grid architecture inspired by computational economies and demonstrates how it can be realized by leveraging the existing grid technologies and building new economic-oriented capabilities and components. We present solutions to these challenges based on our experience in designing and developing market-oriented Gridbus technologies such as Grid Market Directory, Grid Bank, Grid Service Broker, Workflow Engine, and SLA-based enterprise Grid Resource Allocation system.

One advantage of the proposed UTE is that managers of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) systems have no privilege within UTE. Therefore cloud computing managers cannot interfere in Trusted Coordinator functionality. It has been assumed UTE should be kept by a third agent without any incentives to collude with IaaS services and highly trusted to ensure confidential execution of guest virtual machines.

These challenges are mainly related to inherent difficulties in solving some ""meta-problems"", in particular broadly perceived decision making. We assume, on the one hand, business intelligence related perspective, augmented with elements of Web intelligence, to fully use all available tools and resources. On the other hand, we assume a human centric computing perspective in the spirit of, for instance, Dertouzos's ideas. First, we present a brief account of modem approaches to real world decision making, emphasize the concept of a decision making process that involves more factors and aspects like: the use of own and external knowledge, involvement of various ,actors, aspects, etc., individual habitual domains, non-trivial rationality, different paradigms. As an example we mention Checkland's deliberative decision making (which is an important elements of his soft approach to systems analysis). After an analysis of specifics and difficulties encountered in many real world decision-making situations, we strongly advocate the use of computer based decision support systems. First, we briefly review the history of decision support systems, and then present a popular classification, starting from data driven to Web based and inter-organizational. We indicate that decision support systems should incorporate some sort of ""intelligence"", and we first briefly mention some views of what intelligence may mean in this concept, and then assume some more pragmatic, though limited, view of intelligent decision support systems.

Such systems are referenced in literature as service oriented architectures. Classic strategies to address dependability in distributed object computing middleware may not be straightforwardly applied to service oriented architectures (SOAs) for pervasive computing, since they operate in quite different contexts compared to traditional DOC middleware. In this paper, our focus is on dependability issues of SOAs. In particular, we identify dependability requirements of such systems during their life cycle showing how these requirements may change depending on the time phase (discovery, lookup, setup, delivery). We also explore the suitability of Jini technology as an enabling infrastructure to improve availability and reliability, describing both the benefits and drawbacks of a Jini-based solution in the context of a case study application, namely PRINCEPS.","","0-7695-1929-6","","10.1109/WORDS.2003.1218068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1218068","","Availability;Computer architecture;Context-aware services;Distributed computing;Dynamic programming;Home computing;Middleware;Object oriented programming;Pervasive computing;Service oriented architecture","distributed object management;middleware;object-oriented programming;software architecture;software reliability;ubiquitous computing","DOC middleware;Jini technology;PRINCEPS;Web-based computing;component-based computing;dependability;distributed object computing;dynamic service provision environment;heterogeneous service provision environment;pervasive computing;reliability;service oriented architecture;service oriented programming;time phase","","2","","33","","","15-17 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite initial positive results, it is challenging in theory and practice to find an appropriate provider matching the individual requirements. For doing this, the customer has to be clear about his individual targets that should be achieved with cloud computing. That is quit challenging because there are a lot more dimensions to consider than costs and flexibility. Moreover, the selection process is complicated by a number of new entrants as well as offers of non-transparent services, which sometimes differ significantly. In this paper, target dimensions for cloud computing were developed, based on an international literature analysis and interviews with experts. In special, they have been explained using Infrastructure as a Service here. These dimensions should help enterprises to become clear about their requirements on cloud computing and do further steps, like classifying appropriate providers. The relevance of the target dimensions was evaluated with an additional survey conducted among IT managers.","","978-1-4577-1542-6","978-0-7695-4535-6","10.1109/CEC.2011.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046981","Cloud Computing;classification;target dimension","Cloud computing;Companies;Information systems;Interviews;Reliability;Security","cloud computing","IT managers;cloud computing;infrastructure as a service;international literature analysis;selection process;target dimensions","","1","","54","","","5-7 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A survivability-centered research agenda for cloud computing supported emergency response and management systems","Zhanshan Ma; Liexun Yang; Neilson, R.P.; Hess, A.; Millar, R.","State Key Lab. of Genetic Resources &Evolution, Comput.

Ecology Lab, China","Aerospace Conference, 2014 IEEE","20140619","2014","","","1","17","Cloud computing is evolved from grid computing with a key support from the rapidly expanding virtualization technology. We argue that clouding computing is particularly suitable for supporting emergency response and management (ERM) because of some of its unique features such as rapid setup and deployment on ad hoc basis, highly flexible platforms (PaaS: Platform as a Service) and application services (SaaS: Software as a Service) with little time-space constraints. ERM is one of the seven critical national infrastructures and services mandated to protect by the 1999 US President's Executive Order (PCCIP). The paradigm of survivability and survivable network systems was a response of academia to the president's executive order. We concur that survivability should be the lifeline of any ERM, including the cloud computing supported (CCS) ERM systems. In this article, we present a research agenda that is aimed at developing a survivability-centered architecture for evolving reliable and survivable CCS-ERM systems. The research agenda suggests that biological and computational evolutions should be rich sources of biological inspirations as well as powerful optimization algorithm for designing (evolving) the ERM systems. The proposed research agenda advocates the application of three-layer survivability analysis, dynamic hybrid fault models, and extended evolutionary game theory modeling developed by Ma & Krings [Ma & Krings (2008a-e, 2011), Ma et al. (2009a), Ma (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011a,b).

However, building a large dedicated cluster for MapReduce is not cost effective if the system is underutilized. To speedup the MapReduce computation with low cost, the computing resources donated from idle desktop/notebook computers in an organization become true potential. The MapReduce framework is then implemented into Volunteer Computing environment to allow such data processing tasks to be carried out on the unused computers. Virtualization technology is deployed to resolve the security and heterogeneity problem in Volunteer Computing so that the MapReduce jobs can always run under a unified runtime and isolated environment. This paper presents a Hadoop cluster that can be scaled into virtualized Volunteer Computing environment. The system consists of a small fixed set of dedicate nodes plus a variable number of volatile volunteer nodes which give additional computing power to the cluster. To this end, we consolidate Apache Hadoop, the most popular MapReduce implementation, with the virtualized BOINC platform. We evaluate the proposed system on our testbed with MapReduce benchmark that represents different workload patterns. The performance of the Hadoop cluster is measured when its computing capability is expanded with volunteer nodes. The results show that the system can be scaled preferably for CPU-intensive jobs, as opposed to data-intensive jobs which their scalability is more restricted.","","978-1-4799-5821-4","","10.1109/JCSSE.2014.6841858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841858","MapReduce;Virtualization;Volunteer Computing","","security of data;virtualisation;volunteer computing","Apache Hadoop;CPU-intensive jobs;Hadoop cluster performance;Hadoop clusters scaling;MapReduce computation;MapReduce framework;MapReduce jobs;computing power;computing resources;data processing tasks;data-intensive jobs;heterogeneity problem;large-scale data processing;security;virtualization technology;virtualized BOINC platform;virtualized volunteer computing environment;volunteer nodes;workload patterns","","0","","","","","14-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though GPGPU is a hopeful solution for high-load applications, existing methods to utilize GPUs from VMs are subjected to various restraints. In order to solve this problem, we propose a flexible method to share external computing resources by providing transparent access for data in the VMs. By committing commands to a computing host which processes the jobs as substitution, VMs can process high load jobs as necessary even if the VM has a tiny configuration. The computing host mounts the working directories in the VMs and enqueues jobs committed by the VMs. Experimental results show that the overhead of our implementation is sufficiently small in the low I/O load processes.","","978-1-4799-2795-1","","10.1109/CANDAR.2013.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726926","Cloud Computing;GPGPU;Resource Sharing;Virtual Machine","Cloud computing;Context;Graphics processing units;Image processing;Performance evaluation;Resource management;Servers","cloud computing;graphics processing units;virtual machines","GPGPU;cloud computing;many-core accelerator;transparent data access;virtual machine","","0","","11","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, such a virtual technology becomes possible to provide efficient resource management or QoS with virtual network configuration. Thus, it will be important for network construction to provide hardware and software service in near future. Autonomous network configuration in virtual layer is one of such a service. Not only network configuration is constructed in physical layer, but also it should be constructed in virtual layer for providing optimal resource and QoS management. In this paper, Overlay Cloud Computing Service is proposed, and it is consisted of virtual autonomous network configuration in cloud computing service including various server and network services. In our proposal methods, first of all, there are various kinds of user policy such as eco mode, high power mode, and secure mode. Then, virtual network and server configuration is automatically held in virtual layer with the mode setting and hardware configuration. Besides, with observation values of network and server condition, virtual configuration is changed optimally. In this optimal configuration changes, Kalman filter is used for the calculation of network and server condition. Then, with the results of calculation, virtual network topology is changed.

Recently, some social networking systems have also started to exploit context information. These two paradigms serve different purposes. Pervasive computing systems have been designed mainly to address the needs of individual users, thus neglecting the social nature of humans. On the other hand, social computing focuses on exploiting the social relations between users, on promoting their interactions and on supporting the sharing of digital resources among them. However, the recent development and popularity of social networking systems has happened in isolation from the developments in pervasive computing. This paper elaborates on the role of context in both pervasive and social computing environments and introduces the approach of the SOCIETIES project that integrates full scale pervasive functionality in social networking systems to develop the next generation of social media systems. Finally, it discusses the new research challenges that emerge in pervasive social media regarding community context-awareness and the respective benefits that the end users may experience.","","978-1-4673-5075-4","978-1-4673-5076-1","10.1109/PerComW.2013.6529466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529466","Cooperating Smart Space;community context management;innovations;pervasive computing;social networking","Cascading style sheets;Communities;Context;Context modeling;History;Pervasive computing;Social network services","social networking (online);ubiquitous computing","SOCIETIES project;community context management challenge;community context management research;community context-awareness;context information;digital resource sharing;pervasive computing environments;pervasive functionality;pervasive social media systems;social computing;social networking system;social relations","","0","","25","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Approximate computing: An integrated hardware approach","Chippa, V.K.; Venkataramani, S.; Chakradhar, S.T.; Roy, K.; Raghunathan, A.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

Instead, computing platforms are increasingly used to execute applications (such as search, analytics, sensor data processing, recognition, mining, and synthesis) for which “correctness” is defined as producing results that are good enough, or of sufficient quality. These applications are often intrinsically resilient to a large fraction of their computations being executed in an imprecise or approximate manner. However, the design of computing platforms continues to be guided by the principle that every computation must be executed with the same strict notion of correctness. Approximate computing departs from this long-held dogma, and exploits intrinsic application resilience to improve the efficiency (energy or speed) of computing platforms. We describe an integrated approach to approximate computing in hardware that consists of three key components. First, we present an automatic resilience characterization framework that allows the designer to quantitatively evaluate the intrinsic resilience of an application, and to quickly assess the potential of various approximate computing techniques. We then describe scalable effort hardware, an approach to approximate computing wherein hardware is designed with various scaling mechanisms, or knobs that modulate the effort expended towards correctly performing an application's computations. Scaling mechanisms are identified at the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels, and embodied in the hardware to provide a rich trade-off between computational accuracy and energy. Finally, dynamic effort scaling is proposed as a feedback control approach to modulate the scaling mechanisms at runtime in response to varying application requirements and data characteristics. To demonstrate the proposed concepts, we have designed and fabricated an energy-efficient Recognition and Mining (RM) processor in the TSMC 65nm process technology.- Our measurement results demonstrate that approximate computing leads to 2-20X energy savings with minimal impact on output quality across a range of applications.","","978-1-4799-2388-5","","10.1109/ACSSC.2013.6810241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810241","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Kernel;Resilience","data mining;feedback;microprocessor chips;pattern recognition","RM processor;application requirements;approximate computing;automatic resilience characterization framework;computing platforms;correctness notion;data characteristics;dynamic effort scaling;energy-efficient recognition-and-mining processor;feedback control approach;integrated hardware approach;intrinsic application resilience;scalable effort hardware;scaling mechanisms;size 65 nm","","1","","28","","","3-6 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rather than depending on a single technology, people progressed with several whose semantics-empowered convergence and integration will enable us to capture, understand, and reapply human knowledge and intellect. Such capabilities will consequently elevate our technological ability to deal with the abstractions, concepts, and actions that characterize human experiences. This will herald computing for human experience (CHE). The CHE vision is built on a suite of technologies that serves, assists, and cooperates with humans to nondestructively and unobtrusively complement and enrich normal activities, with minimal explicit concern or effort on the humans' part. CHE will anticipate when to gather and apply relevant knowledge and intelligence. It will enable human experiences that are intertwined with the physical, conceptual, and experiential worlds (emotions, sentiments, and so on), rather than immerse humans in cyber worlds for a specific task. Instead of focusing on humans interacting with a technology or system, CHE will feature technology-rich human surroundings that often initiate interactions. Interaction will be more sophisticated and seamless compared to today's precursors such as automotive accident-avoidance systems. Many components of and ideas associated with the CHE vision have been around for a while.

One of the biggest unsolved problems is the management of the reconfigurable hardware in a multi-threaded environment. Most research in reconfigurable computing has assumed a single-threaded model, but this is unrealistic for personal computing and many types of embedded computing. In these cases, there may be several different threads or processes running simultaneously, each wishing to use the reconfigurable hardware. The operating system must decide how to allocate the hardware at run-time based on the status of the system. The system status could also influence the choice of different implementations for each circuit based on area/speed tradeoffs. This paper examines reconfigurable computing as it could be used in mainstream systems, focusing on a proposed scheduling algorithm to allocate the reconfigurable hardware. Our initial tests indicate that reconfigurable computing with our scheduler can easily achieve at least a 20% system-level speedup.","","0-7695-2445-1","","10.1109/FCCM.2005.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508535","","Circuit testing;Embedded computing;Environmental management;Hardware;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Scheduling algorithm;System testing;Yarn","embedded systems;multi-threading;operating systems (computers);reconfigurable architectures;scheduling","embedded computing;multithreaded environment;operating system;personal computing;reconfigurable computing;reconfigurable hardware","","2","","23","","","18-20 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From a cultural standpoint history broadens one's perspective on the field and lets students and scholars explore the inner thinking of people and the events they produced. From a practical standpoint, history enables individuals and enterprises to learn from the events of the past and to improve on experiences. Both views are necessary to create an informed computing professional. Teachers often ignore history of computing when teaching their computing courses. The typical case is that educators mention some facts or important milestones usually related to hardware and the people responsible for these. The discussion then moves quickly to other topics. This is unfortunate, because we can learn much from history. History is the best teacher to assess the meaningful evolution of the computing profession. The IFIP Joint (TC3-TC9) Task Group has examined this concern and is producing a report entitled: History in the Computing Curriculum. The report addresses the need to include history in the curriculum and serves as a basis for this proposal. It also provides educators, whose formal study of computing history is minimal or nonexistent, ways in which to teach computing history in an educational environment.

It enables the bus to adapt more flexibly in response to fluctuation of the environments. Second, the bus model has two-layer meta-object protocols (MOP), which are the component layer MOP and binding layer MOP, for implementation of adaptation. The component MOP plays the roles of inspecting and manipulating each component in the function and resource aspect. The binding MOP plays the roles of inspecting and manipulating each binding in the topology, access and flow aspect. Its architecture makes possible adaptations in integrity. Third, the bus model makes adaptations based on profiles, which is some collected information from the user, host and networks.

We present the design and implementation of one such framework that can work on the Internet, with applications in manufacturing. The architecture, DPAC (distributed and parallel computing framework), has the goal of harnessing the Internet's vast, growing computational capacity for ultra-large, coarse-grained parallel applications. The idea is to bring together diverse, heterogeneous, geographically distributed computing environments in order to attack large-scale computing problems. We present a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture in DPAC and the results of running performance experiments.

Cloud delivers the next-generation computing paradigm that showcases the possibilities of apt resource sharing, true elasticity, and maximum resource utilization as compared to any of its early competitors. In addition to its technicality, corporates are also fascinated with its attractive tag of `pay-as-you-use' business model. After perceiving its advantages, many organizations fear in stepping into this modern computing technology, due to its severe security concerns. In today's world, whole business computing relies on the security of customers and their data. Consequently, due to the public and multi-tenancy nature of the cloud, security concerns and its velocity are huge in volume. eCloudIDS is a next-generation security system designed with innovative hybrid two-tier expert engines, namely uX-Engine and sX-Engine, which is considered as a most suitable security solution for cloud computing environments; precisely for public cloud.

Volunteer computing resources are suitable mainly to run High-Throughput Computing (HTC) applications due to their unavailability rate and frequent churn. Although they provide Peta-scale computing power for many scientific projects across the globe, efficient usage of this platform for different types of applications still has not been investigated in depth. So, characterizing, analyzing and modeling such resources availability in volunteer computing is becoming essential and important for efficient application scheduling. In this paper, we focus on statistical modeling of volunteer resources, which exhibit non-random pattern in their availability time. The proposed models take into account the autocorrelation structure in subset of hosts whose availability has short/long-range dependence. We apply our methodology on real traces from the SETI@home project with more than 230,000 hosts. We show that Markovian arrival process can model the availability and unavailability intervals of volunteer resources with a reasonable to excellent level of accuracy.","","978-1-4799-3213-9","","10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742787","Markov Model;Resource Availability;Statistical Modeling;Volunteer Computing","Availability;Computational modeling","Markov processes;resource allocation;scheduling;volunteer computing","HTC applications;Markovian arrival process;SETI@home project;application scheduling;autocorrelation structure;distributed systems;heterogeneous hosts;high-throughput computing application;peta-scale computing power;resources availability analysis;resources availability modeling;scientific projects;statistical modeling;unreliable Internet-connected hosts;volunteer computing systems","","1","","33","","","6-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, fault tolerance becomes a key property for parallel application running on parallel computing systems. The message passing interface (MPI) is currently the programming paradigm and communication library most commonly used on parallel computing platforms. MPI applications may be stopped at any time during their execution due to an unpredictable failure. In order to avoid complete restarts of an MPI application because of only one failure, a fault tolerant MPI implementation is essential. In this paper, we propose a fault tolerant approach in cluster computing system. Our approach is based on reassignment of tasks to the remaining system and message logging is used for message losses. This system consists of two main parts, failure diagnosis and failure recovery. Failure diagnosis is the detection of a failure and failure recovery is the action needed to take over the workload of a failed component. This fault tolerant approach is implemented as an extension of the message passing interface.","","978-1-4244-2101-5","978-1-4244-2102-2","10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600394","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Concurrent computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;High performance computing;Message passing;Parallel processing;Parallel programming","fault tolerant computing;message passing;parallel processing;probability;program diagnostics;software libraries;system recovery;workstation clusters","cluster computing system;communication library;failure diagnosis;failure probability;failure recovery;fault tolerant approach;high performance computing;message logging;message passing interface;parallel computing platforms","","1","","7","","","14-17 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe the manner in which we applied a text mining approach to analyze all articles of the 2002-2012 editions of a famous IT magazine; attributing to this analysis, we propose a new evolutionary model describing how technological concepts are transformed into services. We focus our analysis on cloud computing, and this analysis reveals that the technical concept of ""grid computing"" and other related concepts appeared together in the first phase. In the second phase, such a group of words integrate to form a new concept, SaaS, which later expands into PaaS and IaaS. Finally SaaS develops into ""cloud computing"", and gains recognition in each industry as a completely specialized service concept (i.e., ""x-cloud""). In addition, our analysis reveals that concept evolution has been affected by another evolution, namely from the organization-oriented world to the individual-oriented world by the advancement of social networking in our societies. This phenomenon provides further interpretation on concept evolution.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921242","","Business;Cloud computing;Correlation;Grid computing;Industries;Software as a service;Text mining","business data processing;cloud computing;evolutionary computation;social networking (online)","IT;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;business environment;cloud computing;cloud computing case study;core technologies;evolutionary model;evolutionary process;grid computing;individual oriented world;information technology;organization oriented world;service concept;social networking;software as a service;technology concept;text mining approach","","0","","21","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a multi-hop Cluster-based Architecture for Service Discovery (CASD) in ubiquitous computing environments is presented. Based on the Neighborhood Benchmark (NB) which quantifies the connectivity and link stability of mobile nodes, CASD organizes the network consisting of heterogeneous mobile computing devices to be multi-hop clusters, and constructs each cluster to be a local DHT-based p2p network for distributed storage of service indices. The clusterheads are connected together to form a virtual backbone, based on which service discovery messages are disseminated among clusters. It is shown that CASD can control the communication overhead of service discovery when the network scale increases, and that CASD can achieve robust service discovery by maintaining controllable redundancy of service indices in each cluster. The scalability and robustness of our approach in various types of network settings are shown by intensive simulations.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451021","","Communication system control;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Large-scale systems;Mobile computing;Niobium;Pervasive computing;Robustness;Stability;Ubiquitous computing","mobile computing;pattern clustering;peer-to-peer computing","Neighborhood Benchmark;cluster-based architecture for service discovery;clusterheads;communication overhead;heterogeneous mobile computing devices;local DHT-based p2p network;mobile nodes;multihop clustering;ubiquitous computing","","2","","19","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, such infrastructures are normally provided in large data centres and the applications are executed remotely from the users. One reason for this is that cloud computing requires a reasonably stable infrastructure and networking environment, largely due to management reasons. Networking of Information (NetInf) is an information centric networking paradigm that can support cloud computing by providing new possibilities for network transport and storage. It offers direct access to information objects through a simple API, independent of their location in the network. This abstraction can hide much of the complexity of storage and network transport systems that cloud computing today has to deal with. In this paper we analyze how cloud computing and NetInf can be combined to make cloud computing infrastructures easier to manage, and potentially enable deployment in smaller and more dynamic networking environments. NetInf should thus be understood as an enhancement to the infrastructure for cloud computing rather than a change to cloud computing technology as such. To illustrate the approach taken by NetInf, we also describe how it can be implemented by introducing a specific name resolution and routing mechanism.","1524-4547","978-0-7695-3683-5","","10.1109/WETICE.2009.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159218","Keywords-Cloud computing;Networking of Information (NetInf);name resolution;network architecture;routing","Application software;Cloud computing;Computer network management;Environmental management;Hardware;Internet;Network servers;Routing;Uniform resource locators;Web server","Internet;Web services","Netlnf;cloud computing infrastructures;end user services;information access;information centric networking;infrastructure enhancement;network transport;service provisioning","","4","","7","","","June 29 2009-July 1 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, due to the nature of autonomous clouds to form administrative boundaries, depend able collaboration becomes a much harder problem. Employing information proxies may help improve such collaboration in existence of administrative boundaries. Although a general proxy definition can refer to many contexts, we focus on such proxies for dependable collaboration for distributed resource scheduling. Our definition of information proxies, and the particular areas we make use of them mainly contribute to the self configuring and self-optimizing fundamentals of the autonomic computing paradigm in general.

As an example, many primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI's) do not have the facilities, time, or money to purchase hardware, maintain user accounts, configure software components, and keep ahead of the latest security advisories for a dedicated clustering environment. The BCCD project's primary goal is to support an instantaneous, drop-in distributed computing environment. A consequence of providing such an environment is the ability to promote the education of high performance computing issues at the undergraduate level through the ability to turn an ordinary lab of networked workstations temporarily into a non-invasive, fully-functional clustering classroom. The BCCD itself is a self-contained clustering environment in a bootable CD format. Using the BCCD, students, educators and researchers are able to gain insight into configuration, utilization, troubleshooting, debugging, and administration issues uniquely associated with parallel computing in a live, easy to use ""drop-in"" clustering environment. As the name implies, the BCCD provides a full, cohesive clustering environment running GNU/Linux when booted from the CDROM drives of networked workstations.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420189","PXE-boot clusters;Practical experiences with parallel and distributed systems;clustering environments;diskless clusters;high performance computing education;high performance computing environments","Chaos;Computer science;Computer science education;Distributed computing;Educational technology;High performance computing;Linux;Packaging;Parallel processing;Workstations","CD-ROMs;Linux;computer science education;parallel processing;workstation clusters","Bootable Cluster CD;CDROM drives;GNU;Linux;distributed computing environment;high performance computing education;parallel computing;primarily undergraduate institution;software component","","1","","16","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will smash protons together with such force that it could release showers of subatomic particles that haven't existed since the big bang. Sophisticated detectors will catch those particles and release a corresponding flood of data-some 15 Pbytes a year-which scientists will have to painstakingly compare to similar volumes of simulation data before they can make new discoveries. For five years, scientists and engineers have been building the computing grid that will make it possible.

Traditional security mechanisms used in centralized systems are not suited for P2P computing systems because there is no central point of authority. The working of a P2P computing system is highly dependent on collaboration of peers. To improve the collaboration between peers many trust management systems have been developed recently. This study proposed a Bayesian network based trust model with time window to measure the trustworthiness of task processor peer in pure P2P computing framework. The proposed model is compared with Bayesian network based trust model using JADE 4.3.0.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","11 pp.","","A standard notation, that unambiguously expresses different aspects of a system, is important to the process of software development. The expressiveness of a standard notation helps analysts and developers to describe a computing scenario or to formulate software architecture and then to communicate these decisions unambiguously to other team members. Much attention is already given to the software development methodologies and architectural descriptions. Specifically, statecharts and state transition diagrams have been used to show the state space of a system, the events that cause state transitions and the actions that result from a state change. The paradigm shift to object-oriented programming has changed the method of system analysis and design from traditional top-down approach to bottom-up object-oriented approach. This change in approach has motivated the development of objectcharts that depict the behaviour of objects used in a system. This paper extends the notational capabilities of objectcharts to specify the issues related to the mobile computing. We discuss the specialty and the limitations found in mobile computing to motivate the readers on the necessity of having methods for developing mobile computing applications. We have shown that while making use of all the niceties of Statecharts as well as objectcharts, the formalism can be extended for developing mobile computing applications. First, we discuss the need for an extension of objectchart notation by showing the limitations of objectcharts in specifying mobile computing applications. Second, we propose an extension to objectcharts, referred to as Mobicharts. The proposed Mobicharts can specify the important characteristics of mobile computing applications. We illustrate typical mobile computing characteristics such as migration, hoarding, cloning, synchronization, sharing and disconnected operations using Mobicharts.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174844","","Application software;Communication standards;Computer applications;Mobile computing;Object oriented programming;Software architecture;Software standards;Standards development;State-space methods;System analysis and design","formal specification;mobile computing;object-oriented programming","MOBICHARTS;Mobicharts;architectural descriptions;bottom-up object-oriented approach;cloning;container;disconnected operations;hoarding;inheritance;migration;mobile computing;notational specifications;object-oriented programming;objectchart notation;sharing;software architecture;software development;standard notation;state transition diagrams;statecharts;synchronization;system analysis;system design;system state space;top-down object-oriented approach","","2","","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent ambiguity in human thinking with the real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and genetic algorithms (GA) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and GA should not be viewed as competing with each other but synergistic and complementary instead, as emphasized by Dr. Zadeh . Considering the available literature, it is easy to conclude that the fusion of individual soft computing methodologies has been advantageous in numerous applications.

However, large computing power in itself is not sufficient for high performance computing (HPC). In this context, (application) partitioning and load balancing strategies play a critical role in meeting the high performance requirements and in achieving high processor utilization. In HPC applications such as molecular simulations, protein synthesis, drug design et cetera parallel loops constitute the greatest percentage of program parallelism. The degree to which parallelism can be exploited during parallel execution of a nested loop directly depends on partitioning and load balance, i.e., the number of iterations mapped onto each processor, between the different processors. Thus, partitioning of parallel loops is of key importance for grid-based high performance scientific computing. Although a significant amount of work has been done in partitioning of iteration spaces of nested loops, both rectangular and non-rectangular iteration spaces, for homogeneous multiprocessor systems, the problem of partitioning of iteration spaces for heterogeneous systems has not been given enough attention so far. In this paper, we present a geometric approach for partitioning N-dimensional non-rectangular iteration spaces for optimizing performance on heterogeneous parallel processor systems.

To satisfy the green computing, a tradeoff between user access (which locates in several locations) and backup (which stores the data at least in two data centers) were balanced to minimize the energy consumption. The objective of minimum energy consumption subjects to the required link and nodal capacity, service level, access proportion, delay, and CSs selection.

To make Condor seamlessly work across private networks and over firewalls, we designed and implemented Dynamic Port Forwarding (DPF) and Generic Connection Brokering (GCB). Both DPF and GCB satisfy the representative requirements. Furthermore DPF supports dedicated large clusters very well because it is simple, efficient, and highly scalable. On the other hand, GCB perfectly supports non-dedicated or personal clusters because it is independent to private network or firewall technologies and does not require airy administrative power to deploy it.

By using stereotypes and tag values, it is possible to define a meta-model which is suitable for modeling the system deployed in cloud computing. We show that by using the UML profile, it's possible to model the infrastructures and instances of the cloud. Also it's probable to cover all the requirements that the software designer needs to model the cloud computing. It is concluded that it is important to use a standard modeling language to model the cloud, which makes it possible to model and test the whole system with a unified language. The standard languages such as UML reduce the cost required for understanding and designing the cloud computing's model.

Reservoir computing (RC) is a new computing paradigm that allows to harness the intrinsic dynamics of a “reservoir” to perform useful computations. The reservoir, or compute core, must only provide sufficiently rich dynamics that are then mapped onto a low-dimensional space by an readout layer. One of the key advantages of this approach is that only the readout layer needs to be adapted to perform the desired computation. The reservoir itself remains unchanged. In this paper we use for the first time memristive components as reservoir building blocks that are assembled into device networks. Memristive components are particularly interesting for this purpose because of their non-linear and memory characteristics. In addition, they can be integrated very densely and provide rich dynamics with a few components only. We use pattern recognition and associative memory tasks to illustrate the memristive reservoir computing approach. For that purpose, we have built a software framework that allows to create valid memristor networks, to simulate and evaluate them in Ngspice, and to train the readout layer by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results show that we can efficiently and robustly classify temporal patterns. The approach presents a promising new computing paradigm that harnesses the non-linear, time-dependent, and highly-variable properties of current memristive components for solving computational tasks.","","978-1-4503-1671-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6464167","","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Genetic algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling;Memristors;Reservoirs;Training","content-addressable storage;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);memristors;neural nets;pattern recognition","Ngspice simulation;associative memory task;compute core;computing paradigm;feature size scaling;genetic algorithm;highly-variable properties;memristive components;memristive reservoir computing;memristor based reservoir computing;memristor network;nonBoolean computing model;nonlinear properties;nonvon Neumann computing model;pattern recognition task;readout layer;reservoir building blocks;temporal pattern classification;time-dependent properties","","2","","29","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we develop algorithms for computing batches of medium grained tasks with soft deadlines in pull- style volunteer computing environments. Using assumptions about worker availability intervals based on previous studies, we develop models of unreliable workers in volunteer computing environments. These models are used to develop algorithms for task distribution in volunteer computing systems with a high probability of meeting batch deadlines.

This bio-inspired computing platform has been conceived upon a tissue-topology configuration by introducing a novel two-dimensional on two-layer coarse-fine-grid network model (2D2L-CFG). By choosing a design strategy relying on a multi-cellular concept which outlines the versatility of biologically inspired technologies, task allocation, communication, or fault-tolerance problems are solved with high efficiency. Moreover, careful real-time simulations prove that by implementing methods that imitate biological processes, such architectures could be considered to be “intelligent” because of their capability to adapting in response to changes of their surrounding environment. The benefits of this approach are also confirmed by experiments performed on a laboratory-prototype VLSI hardware platform.

Ideally, we would like to accommodate a given Grid application using a set of computing resources (e.g., one server) that are not geographically distributed (e.g., in the same LAN); however, this is not always possible. Indeed, to increase the probability of accommodating grid applications, we may need to use computing resources scattered all over the network; in this case, bandwidth allocation is required to enable communication among these resources. In this paper, we propose an optimization model that enables the ""simultaneous"" allocation of computing resources and bandwidth for grid application while maximizing the number of grid applications being accommodated.

Strategies are derived for scheduling three common, significant families of such dags for IC: reduction-meshes, which represent (the intertask dependencies of) computations that can be performed by ""up-sweeps"" of meshes; reduction-trees, which represent ""accumulative"" computations that can be performed by ""up-sweeps"" of trees; and FFT (fast fourier transform) dags, which represent a large variety of convolutional computations. Two criteria are used to assess the quality of a schedule: its memory requirements and its rate of producing tasks that are eligible for allocation to remote clients. These criteria are important because of, respectively, the typically enormous sizes of IC computations and the typical temporal unpredictability of remote clients in IC. In particular, a high production rate of eligible tasks decreases a computation's vulnerability to the gridlock that can occur when a computation stalls pending the return of intermediate results by remote clients. Under idealized assumptions, the schedules derived are optimal in the rate of producing eligible tasks and are either exactly or approximately optimal in memory requirements.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2005.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401862","Index Terms- Internet-based computing;Web computing;convolutional computations;global computing;grid computing;mesh-structured computations;reduction computations;scheduling;tree-structured computations.","Collaboration;Fast Fourier transforms;Grid computing;Guidelines;Integrated circuit modeling;Internet;Processor scheduling;Production;Timing;Web server","Internet;fast Fourier transforms;grid computing;mesh generation;scheduling;tree data structures","Internet-based computing;Web computing;convolutional computation;fast fourier transform;global computing;grid computing;memory requirement;mesh-structured computation;reduction computation;tree-structured computation","","14","","30","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Trusted ILLIAC is a reliable and secure computing platform being built at the University of Illinois Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) and Information Trust Institute (ITI), involving faculty from Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science Departments. The end goal is a large, demonstrably trustworthy enterprise-class computing system to support, what is variously referred to as on-demand/utility computing or adaptive enterprise-computing Such systems require that a significant number of applications co-exist and share hardware/software resources using a variety of containment boundaries. Current solutions aim at providing hardware and software solutions that can only be described as one-size-fits-all approaches. Today's cyber-infrastructures are complex, expensive to implement, and nearly impossible to validate The challenge is to provide an application-specific level of reliability and security in a totally transparent manner, while delivering optimal performance. A promising approach lies in developing a new set of methods that provide customized levels of trust (specified by the application) enforced in hardware, using an integrated approach involving reprogrammable hardware, enhanced compiler methods to extract security and reliability properties;. Our approach is to demonstrate such a set of integrated techniques that span entire system hierarchy: processor hardware, operating system, and application. This talk will describe the current status, the prototype hardware and software and on-going plans.

However, for those applications that need to be finished before the given deadline, a fault in the system will lead to the failure of the application. Therefore, fault-tolerant policy is necessary to improve the performance of the system when faults could happen. In this paper, we address to the fault-tolerant problem for the optical network based distributed computing system. We first propose an overlay approach which applies the existing fault-tolerant policies for distributed computing and optical network. Then we present a joint fault-tolerant policy which takes into account the fault tolerance for computing resource and network resource in the same time. We compare the performances of different polices by simulation. The simulation results show that the joint fault-tolerant policy achieves much better performances compared to overlay approaches.","","978-0-7695-3156-4","978-0-7695-3156-4","10.1109/CCGRID.2008.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534291","Distributed Computing;Fault-tolerance;Optical Network","Computer networks;Distributed computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Grid computing;Middleware;Optical computing;Optical fiber networks;Real time systems;Sun","fault tolerance;middleware;optical communication;telecommunication computing","distributed computing system;fault-tolerant policy;heterogeneous resources;large-scale data-intensive distributed applications;middlewares;optical network","","2","","10","","","19-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Programmable hardware offers unique opportunities for flexible control and processing on board spacecrafts and satellites. Space missions dictate stringent requirements on size, weight, power, versatility and performance of the on-board data acquisition and computing resources. Reconfigurable FPGA-based devices, with the programmability of software and speed/size approaching application-specific integrated circuits, make it possible to control and communicate with sensors, as well as process scientific data right on the spacecraft, sending only relevant information back home over the low bandwidth communications link. Challenges to computing in harsh space environments abound: vibration, thermal cycling, heat dissipation, and radiation all take their toll on space electronics. In spite of these barriers, notable experiments in reconfigurable computing for space applications are being undertaken. These include NASA's reconfigurable scalable computing project, intended for planetary rovers, cameras, and other sensors; the Queensland University FedSat and its successors, using FPGAs for near real-time image processing, communications, and navigation; and the Cibola Flight Experiment, a Los Alamos National Laboratory experiment in on-orbit signal processing using radiation-tolerant FPGAs.

AIPR 2007. 36th IEEE","20080331","2007","","","80","86","Traditional computing uses transistors and binary logic in order to perform computing operations. This approach has proved successful as long as the number of transistors per integrated circuit can be scaled to accommodate increasing speed and heat requirements. Unfortunately, this approach does not allow speeds above the limit where the size of the transistors approaches the limit of the integrated circuit substrates' molecular size. In this condition, electrons cannot reliably be contained within the boundaries separating one transistor from the next and increasingly small circuits become impractical. The current solution to this dilemma is to increase the number of functional units on an integrated circuit and thereby eliminate the need for increasingly small transistors. However whether we increase the number of functional units or the speed, there are inherent limitations in the number of transistors we can put onto one chip. We therefore look to another functional approach to generate the next generation of integrated circuits. We therefore look to using the molecules and elementary particles themselves as a means of computation. In order to accomplish molecular computation we need to modify the model of traditional computation from a transistor based binary method to analog based arbitrary basis model. This approach is not unknown since optical computation among other has used analog processing for highly parallel computation. The issue with molecular and quantum computing methods has traditionally been that understanding the state the computing function itself is often subject to high degree uncertainty. This uncertainty is not unexpected since the number of possible states that can exist when electromagnetic energy interrogates a collection of molecules, atoms, or electrons is quite large. In order to develop a method of representing these states we use a partially observable Markov decision process. We will then develop a finite state machine approach to - computation based on a model for our molecular or quantum system.","1550-5219","978-0-7695-3066-6","","10.1109/AIPR.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476127","molecular computing","Analog computers;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Electrons;Logic;Molecular computing;Optical computing;Quantum computing;Transistors;Uncertainty","Markov processes;analogue processing circuits;biocomputing;biomolecular electronics;finite state machines;integrated circuit design","Markov decision process;analog based arbitrary basis model;binary logic;finite state machine;integrated circuit;mathematical architecture;molecular computing;quantum computing method","","1","","7","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But applying traditional access control model into the Cloud directly could not solve the uncertainty and vulnerability caused by the open conditions of cloud computing. In cloud computing environment, only when the security and reliability of both interaction parties are ensured, data security can be effectively guaranteed during interactions between users and the Cloud. Therefore, building a mutual trust relationship between users and cloud platform is the key to implement new kinds of access control method in cloud computing environment. Combining with Trust Management(TM), a mutual trust based access control (MTBAC) model is proposed in this paper. MTBAC model take both user's behavior trust and cloud services node's credibility into consideration. Trust relationships between users and cloud service nodes are established by mutual trust mechanism.

The fast growing rate of the usage of large-scale computing machines on cloud platform has resulted in increased consumption of energy and emission of carbon. Such negative effects should be curbed for a more environmental-friendly computing platform, e.g. a green cloud computing platform. Scheduling is one of the aspects that can be looked into in regards to the improvement of the whole cloud architecture, specifically in the scope of resource management. One of the important features that need to be optimized in regards to scheduling is the load balancing process that emphasizes on optimal resource utilization, maximum throughput, maximum response time and prevention of overload. One way to optimize the load balancing process is by implementing the migration of virtual machines across multiple hosts, in which utilization of CPU resources can be optimized. The appropriate use of two different classes of resources e.g. low-powered and high-powered machines based on their Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) metrics, will lead to minimal process execution time if both types of resources are being efficiently used and effectively mapped to suitable types of processing. According to different machine performance, the migration of virtual machines will be computed based on the current CPU utilization following three different conditions, i.e. when the CPU usage reaches its 90%, 10% and 0% marker. Based on this idea, a general algorithm in activating the virtual machine migration is proposed, in which the overall load balancing process could be improved.","","978-1-4799-4654-9","","10.1109/ICIAS.2014.6869540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6869540","CPU Utilization;Cloud Computing;Cloudsim;load balancing;virtual machine migration","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Load management;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;green computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","CPU resource utilization;MIPS metrics;carbon emission;cloud architecture;energy consumption;environmental-friendly computing platform;green cloud computing platform;high-powered machines;large-scale computing machines;load balancing process;low-powered machines;maximum response time;maximum throughput;million instructions per second metric;minimal process execution time;optimal resource utilization;resource management;scheduling;virtual machine migration","","0","","16","","","3-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The service-specific data modeling paradigms and SDKs increase the complexity of data sharing between consumer applications that interact with the different services of the cloud computing platform. To make matters more complicated, it's not uncommon in an enterprise to find different groups using different cloud computing platforms. In this paper, we will describe a set of abstractions that can be used to abstract different computing platforms. The abstractions not only abstract the computing platform, but also enable the data discovery and sharing between applications.

"Trust Ticket Deployment: A Notion of a Data Owner's Trust in Cloud Computing","Ahmed, M.; Yang Xiang","Sch. of Inf.

A data owner (DO) loses control over the data outsourced to a machine in the cloud controlled and operated by a cloud service provider (CSP). This machine is at a location unknown to a data owner. This loss of control over data is further intensified with the lack of managing users' access to the data from practical cloud computing perspectives. In this paper, we introduce a new mechanism of ensuring trust and security in Software as a Service (SaaS) CC. Trust Ticket, with the supporting protocols, is our mechanism that helps a data owner in establishing a link between a CSP and a registered user. In our mechanism, a user first gets registered with a DO before receiving a Trust Ticket and a secret key from that DO. Each Trust Ticket is unique and encrypted. On completing the registration of each user, the DO apprises the CSP of the Trust Ticket. Trust Ticket and secret key are respectively for the registered user's getting accepted to the CSP and having a view of the data owner's data upon a successful verification by the CSP. We have done our experiment in Java network programming by creating an emulated cloud computing framework under the VMware ESXi 4.1 hypervisor based platform. Using the framework, we have evaluated our algorithmic protocol for Trust Ticket. We have also compared our work with prior work. Overall performance of our work is better. We argue that our proposed algorithmic protocol for Trust Ticket deployment establishes a data owner's trust. This trust is established through a data owner's control over data and a registered user; because a registered user is linked with a CSP by a data owner through Trust Ticket.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120809","Cloud Computing;Control;Security;Trust;Trust Ticket","Authentication;Cloud computing;Databases;Protocols;Public key","Java;cloud computing;trusted computing","CC;CSP;DO;Java network programming;SaaS;VMware ESXi 4.1 hypervisor;algorithmic protocol;cloud computing;cloud service provider;data owners trust;ondemand computing;security mechanism;software as a service;transparent trust;trust ticket deployment","","1","","21","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a Mobile Cloud Resources Provisioning (MCRP) scheme, which is flexible enough to adapt to the various general MCC reference use cases being described. The main novelty feature of the employed MCC Service Admission Control algorithm lies in the fact that it jointly handles radio and computing resources rather than confronting the problem as two independent resource management sub-problems.

Unlike most existing solutions delivering service with various protocols based on image transmitting in PC dominating environment, we present a DaaS with cloud server technologies on FPGA to address the problem of high power consumption and heavy network traffic. With the booming of mobile cloud computing, users can access the service on demand with smart phones or other portable devices like iPad or Amazon kindle as well as PC. Our system provides virtual desktop web pages written in HTML/JavaScript to avoid frequent image transmissions and reduce network traffic.

Chiefly small and medium-size organizations can manage their projects by using cloud-based services and also able to achieve productivity enhancement with limited budgets. But, apart from all of these benefits, it may not be fully trustworthy. Cloud Computing do not keep data on the user's system, so there is a need of data security. The user pays progressively attention about data security due to this off-side storage of data on cloud computing. In order to retain confidentiality of data against un-trusted cloud service providers, There are so many approaches. All modern cloud service providers solve this problem by encryption and decryption techniques. They all have their merits and demerits. In present thesis, the basic dilemma of cloud computing security is inspected. We have also proposed a survey of various models for cloud security. To ensure the data security in the cloud, we suggest an efficient, accessible and adaptable cryptography based scheme.

Consequently, there is the persistent need to simplify the interface for the generic user. This need is particularly acute in the Signal/Image Processing (SIP), Integrated Modeling and Test Environments (IMT), and related DoD communities where typical users have heterogeneous unconsolidated needs. Typically, in these communities, most users work from a Windows PC and just the overhead involved in learning UNIX well enough to accomplish HPC tasks is itself a significant barrier. Virtualization is a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources from the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact with those resources. In this proof-of-concept study, we report on our experience with SIP applications running on top of a virtual Windows platform -guest OS- that itself runs on top of High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) HPC platforms running Linux -host OS-. Productivity is strongly influenced by the workflow of the user (e.g., time spent running vs. time spent programming). Therefore, we study performance and productivity aspects of this novel approach using the realistic and prototypical SIP algorithms embedded in the DARPApsilas High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) Challenge Scalable Synthetic Compact Application Benchmark # 3 (SSCA # 3). SSCA # 3 is also part of the High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC) benchmark challenge and contains sensor processing (SAR) and knowledge formation (ATR) algorithms. Our conclusion is that virtualization technology is a promising approach to preserve desktop PC user productivity while, transparently, allowing the exploitation of HPC systems. This may ease the migration of SIP and other non-traditional computation technology areas (CTAs) codes to HPC - - platforms fostering the utilization of HPCMP resources among these communities.","","978-1-4244-3323-0","","10.1109/DoD.HPCMP.UGC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755900","","Application virtualization;Embedded computing;High performance computing;Image processing;Linux;Physics computing;Productivity;Resource virtualization;Signal processing;Testing","parallel machines;productivity;virtual machines","ATR;SAR;SIP applications;computation technology areas;high performance computing modernization program;high performance embedded computing;high productivity computing;knowledge formation;sensor processing;user workflow;virtual Windows platform;virtualization","","1","","","","","14-17 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional utilities where a single provider scheme is a common practice, the ubiquitous access to cloud resources easily enables the simultaneous use of different clouds. In this paper, we explore this scenario to deploy a computing cluster on the top of a multicloud infrastructure, for solving loosely coupled Many-Task Computing (MTC) applications. In this way, the cluster nodes can be provisioned with resources from different clouds to improve the cost effectiveness of the deployment, or to implement high-availability strategies. We prove the viability of this kind of solutions by evaluating the scalability, performance, and cost of different configurations of a Sun Grid Engine cluster, deployed on a multicloud infrastructure spanning a local data center and three different cloud sites: Amazon EC2 Europe, Amazon EC2 US, and ElasticHosts. Although the testbed deployed in this work is limited to a reduced number of computing resources (due to hardware and budget limitations), we have complemented our analysis with a simulated infrastructure model, which includes a larger number of resources, and runs larger problem sizes. Data obtained by simulation show that performance and cost results can be extrapolated to large-scale problems and cluster infrastructures.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611500","Cloud computing;computing cluster;loosely coupled applications.;multicloud infrastructure","Analytical models;Clouds;Computational modeling;Europe;Hardware;Mathematical model;Throughput","cloud computing;computer centres;ubiquitous computing","Amazon EC2 Europe;Amazon EC2 US;ElasticHosts;IT organization;Sun Grid Engine cluster;cloud computing;computing cluster;coupled many task computing application;data center;high availability strategies implementation;loosely coupled MTC;multicloud deployment;multicloud infrastructure;service platform;ubiquitous access","","14","","19","","2010-10-28","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Adaptive trust evaluation is a fundamental component for secure computing in the cloud environment. Although several methods have been proposed recently for modeling and evaluating trust in distributed computing environments, there is no general accepted trust evaluation model for cloud computing. In this paper a new trust evaluation method has been proposed. In this scheme, each new customer of a cloud service can determine its trust level using the past experiences of previous customers of this cloud service. The proposed method introduces an adaptive method that helps distinguish between malicious and reliable customer feedbacks. The proposed scheme assigns a reliability weight to each customer feedback. Users who have shared any cloud service before and did rate it similarly are more likely to have the same opinion of a new service. Hence, their evaluation of a new service should be given a higher weight. In cases where no customer has shared a common service with us before, then existing customers who have had a feedback closer to the majority (in any service) may seem to be more reliable and hence their opinion is given a higher weight. The balance between the feedback of customers with shared service and those of majority consensus in the final decision is determined dynamically and based on the rate of malicious attacks. This way the method can respond better to changes in the rate and sources of malicious attacks. The proposed method has been compared with an existing trust evaluation method and proved its superiority in minimizing the effect of malicious feedbacks, and having a faster response time.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767353","Trust evaluation;cloud computing;direct trust;indirect trust","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Educational institutions;Robustness;Security","cloud computing;distributed processing;trusted computing","adaptive trust evaluation;cloud computing;cloud service;customer feedback reliability;distributed computing environment;malicious attack;reliability weight;secure computing","","0","","13","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This new technology not only offers tremendous computing power and storage to the mobile devices with limited processing and storage capabilities but also increases the affordability and reliability. Despite providing various benefits, MCC is still in its early stages in providing trust guarantees to a user. Location-Based Services (LBS), on the other hand, are those services which operate on a user's location to provide him/her services such as finding nearby restaurants, hospitals, bus terminal and ATMs, to name a few. While a user's location is mandatory for LBS to work, it imposes serious threats to the user's privacy. In this paper we propose a privacy preserving cloud-based computing architecture for using location-based services. On one hand, our architecture provides a secure mechanism for using LBS services anonymously while on the other hand it utilizes untrusted but fast and reliable cloud services for its implementation in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, we provide various attack scenarios and show that how our architecture preserves the privacy of the user and is difficult to compromise.","","","","10.1109/UCC.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6809340","location based services;location privacy;mobile cloud computing","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Databases;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Privacy;Servers","cloud computing;data privacy;mobile computing","location based services;mobile cloud computing;mobile devices;privacy preserving cloud-based computing platform;trust guarantees;user privacy","","0","","20","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit.

In general, cost of utilizing computing resources provisioned by reservation plan is cheaper than that provisioned by on-demand plan, since cloud consumer has to pay to provider in advance. With the reservation plan, the consumer can reduce the total resource provisioning cost. However, the best advance reservation of resources is difficult to be achieved due to uncertainty of consumer's future demand and providers' resource prices. To address this problem, an optimal cloud resource provisioning (OCRP) algorithm is proposed by formulating a stochastic programming model. The OCRP algorithm can provision computing resources for being used in multiple provisioning stages as well as a long-term plan, e.g., four stages in a quarter plan and twelve stages in a yearly plan. The demand and price uncertainty is considered in OCRP. In this paper, different approaches to obtain the solution of the OCRP algorithm are considered including deterministic equivalent formulation, sample-average approximation, and Benders decomposition. Numerical studies are extensively performed in which the results clearly show that with the OCRP algorithm, cloud consumer can successfully minimize total cost of resource provisioning in cloud computing environments.","1939-1374","","","10.1109/TSC.2011.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710870","Cloud computing;resource provisioning;stochastic programming.;virtual machine placement;virtualization","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Programming;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty;Virtual machining","cloud computing;pricing;stochastic programming","Benders decomposition;OCRP algorithm;cloud computing;computing resource utilization cost;consumer future demand uncertainty;deterministic equivalent formulation;on-demand plans;optimal cloud resource provisioning algorithm;provider resource price uncertainty;reservation plan;resource provisioning cost optimization;sample-average approximation;stochastic programming model","","61","1","28","","2011-02-10","April-June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A cloud is an aggregation of resources or services that are provided as service through network. In earlier version of cloud computing (grid computing) it was enough to find the subset of resources for the applications whereas cloud computing goes one step higher allocating resources to Virtual Machines (VM's) as well as scheduling tasks on the VM's. So resource scheduling is indispensable in cloud computing for load balancing and maximizing the utilization while minimizing the execution time and energy. Few approaches relating to energy salvation have certain disadvantages such as, time complexity and slow Convergence. Hence Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) is developed by bringing together the echo-localization and hibernation properties for scheduling resources as well as conserving energy. Promotion of energy salvation in cloud environment is achieved in a well delineated manner. By using the performance metrics such as total energy consumed by physical resources, SLA violation (CPU performance) and VM migration, we have manipulated our approach through real time implementation by setting up a private cloud employing VMware.","","","","10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922463","Bat Algorithm;Chiropteran;Echo-Localization;Energy Salvation;Hibernation","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Scheduling","cloud computing;energy conservation;grid computing;power aware computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","EAMOCA;SLA violation;VM migration;VMware;bio inspired energy-aware multiobjective Chiropteran algorithm;echo-localization;energy conservation;energy salvation;grid computing;hibernation properties;hybrid cloud computing environment;load balancing;private cloud;resource allocation;resource scheduling;task scheduling;virtual machines","","0","","40","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It mainly concerns with the load balancing of cloud data centers to improve efficiency of the host machine and minimize number of active host machine to support green computing concept. To balance the load of entire data center, we need to transfer the virtual machines of the overloaded host to the light weighted host using migration techniques. In this paper, we introduce a threshold based Dynamic compare and balance algorithm (DCABA) for cloud server optimization. Unlike the traditional server optimization strategies which consider only load balancing and scheduling of resources based on the usage of CPU, RAM and BW in physical servers, DCABA also minimizes the number of host machines to be powered on, for reducing the cost of cloud services.

Uncontrolled disclosure of information or unconstrained interaction among entities may have extremely grave consequences. Traditional security policies and mechanisms are inadequate for pervasive computing applications. Unlike traditional applications, pervasive computing applications have no definite security perimeters and are dynamic in nature. Pervasive computing applications may need to interact with entities that are not known a priori and therefore cannot be trusted. The traditional binary notion of trust where known entities are completely trusted and unknown entities are distrusted are not suitable for such applications. To fill this gap, we develop a trust model useful for pervasive computing applications and develop strategies for establishing trust between entities.

But is there an alternative option? To answer this question, this paper carries out total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis of a private resource system and dedicated large HPC system. In particular, we detail the specific costs of a private resource system from a LUNAR project, a large dedicated HPC system from the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and international EGEE grid project. With this data, we compare the performance and cost-benefits of a dedicated HPC system in contrast to a private resource system.

Third International Conference on","20030915","2003","","","12","","With the tremendous advances in hand-held computing and communication capabilities, rapid proliferation of mobile computing environments, and decreasing device costs, we are seeing a growth in mobile e-business in various consumer and business markets. The trend is also picking up in large enterprises where dependency on mobile e-business environments has become routine for thousands of employees conducting daily business activities. For such a large collection of users, new reliable methods of search-find-obtain-transact (SPOT) have to be devised that are decentralized and self-managing. We present the grand challenges involved in designing and implementing reliable and transparent e-business applications in a decentralized and autonomous fashion that can handle business-critical applications in enterprises and virtual organizations. We present a novel architecture and framework for end-to-end mobile e-business applications based on concepts from P2P, dynamic socio-economic networks (overlays) and resource allocation from grid computing. The architecture takes into consideration disconnection, application context, synchronization, transactions and self-managing failure recovery modes to provide mobile users with seamless and transparent access to data and resources when needed. In addition, the mechanisms designed consider decentralized resource management for providing data availability and fast access. In our architecture, we consider a business process design based on state-machines and failure event management to handle disconnection, resource limitations and failures in open dynamic networks. We consider simple cost-based P2P networks as the underlying framework for connecting millions of mobile devices to thousands computational servers. A first-version of this system was designed, implemented and deployed a network of mobile clients using open Web-services standards.","","0-7695-2023-5","","10.1109/PTP.2003.1231497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231497","","Availability;Business communication;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Costs;Grid computing;Handheld computers;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Resource management","business communication;electronic commerce;grid computing;mobile computing;resource allocation;system recovery;virtual enterprises","SPOT method;business process design;cost-based P2P networks;decentralized resource management;dynamic socio-economic networks;end-to-end mobile e-business;enterprise computing;failure event management;grid computing;mobile clients;mobile computing;search-find-obtain-transact method","","0","","","","","1-3 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model allows us to state and verify several properties of these environments such as ""anywhere anyhow services"", ""mobility of devices and applications"" and ""context-aware adaptation "". The model allows us to describe the resources present in an environment, the operations that can be performed in the environment, and how users can use the resources in th environment to perform different kinds of activities.

This paper analyses how cloud computing on the background of Web 2.0 is going to impact the software engineering process to develop quality software. As the cloud provider is an external entity or third party, how difficult will be the interaction with them? How to separate the roles of SW engineers and cloud providers?

Fault Tolerance (FT) for HPC in the cloud is increasingly a challenging issue, because any fault during the execution would result in re-running the application, which will cost time, money and energy. There has been a significant increase in energy consumption of HPC systems in cloud as a result of rerunning application and fault tolerance (e.g., redundant computing). In this paper we present energy efficient fault tolerance for HPC in the cloud. We develop a generic FT algorithm for HPC systems in the cloud. Our algorithm uses proactive processlevel migration approach, however it does not rely on a spare node or redundant computing prior to prediction of a failure.

Among these problems, e.g. interoperability and privacy, identity management and security are strong concerned. Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved in this paper. Since many researchers have done many detailed and fruitful studies in security, the security solution illustrated in this paper is specific in the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4673-3027-5","","10.1109/CGC.2012.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382904","cloud computing;grouping algorithm;identity management (IdM);security;service oriented architecture (SOA)","Authentication;Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Service oriented architecture","cloud computing;data privacy;open systems;service-oriented architecture","SOA;centralized component processing authentication requests;centralized component processing authorization requests;cloud computing;decentralized approach;federated solution;grouping algorithm;identity management deploying strategy;identity management optimization;identity management usability;interoperability problems;privacy problems;security improvement;service-oriented architecture","","0","","16","","","1-3 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resources in a cloud are virtualized as a collection of services using the virtualization technology. Efficient provisioning of resources is a lofty problem due to the lively nature and the need to support heterogeneous applications with diverse performance requirements. The performance guarantee from the cloud datacenter requires efficient utilization of the resources. The efficient resource utilization towards any specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) or constraint on Quality of Service (QoS) alone is not sufficient for the cloud computing environments. Thus, cloud computing requires to strike a balance between the performance based on the negotiated QoS as well as the energy consumption at the datacenter during the process of resource provisioning. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of cloud computing architectures and provisioning mechanisms for delivering the computing as a service. We classify the cloud computing architectures discussed in literature based on their significance in cloud services provisioning mechanism.

Instead of dispatching tasks to physical processors directly, the DH algorithm dispatches tasks to multiple queues. During runtime, the DH algorithm continues to dispatch the scheduled tasks to corresponding physical processor and predicts the transfer rate.

Indeed, unlike grid, elastic computing, such asAmazon's EC2, allows users to allocate and release compute resources on-demand and pay only for what they use. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of resources is infinite. This feature of Clouds has been called âillusion of infiniteresourcesâ. However, despite the proven benefits of using Cloud to run scientific workflows, users lack guidance for choosing between multiple offering while taking into account several objectives which are often conflicting. On the other side, the workflow tasks allocation and scheduling have been shown to be NP-complete problems. Thus, it is convenient to use heuristic rather than deterministic algorithm. The objective of this paper is to design an allocation strategy for Cloud computing platform. More precisely, we propose three complementary bi-criteria approaches for scheduling workflows on distributed Cloud resources, taking into account the overall execution time and the cost incurred by using a set of resources.","2159-6182","978-1-4673-2892-0","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253561","","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Schedules;Scheduling;Virtual machining","cloud computing;grid computing;optimisation;scheduling;workflow management software","NP-complete problems;allocation strategy;bi-criteria workflow tasks allocation;cloud computing environments;distributed Cloud resources;elastic computing;grid computing context;heterogeneous resources;workflow task scheduling","","7","","19","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach is based on several levels of process of parallel and distributed computing. The structured physical and mathematical description of a beam evolution behavior (including space charge forces) allows one to distribute calculations on several computing clusters with parallel computing inside each structural block. Computer algebra tools play the great role in such approach. Indeed, on the one hand, the used matrix formalism for Lie algebraic methods admits symbolic computation and storage of the results in corresponding databases. On the other hand, the possibilities of visual 2D- and 3D-presentation allows one to analyze the studied effects more carefully and intuitively.

Inappropriate capacity planning and related management mechanism applied, will lead HPC cluster into a rather large number of pending jobs which is considered as a critical factor to affect System's throughput against the goal of HPC cluster. Moreover it will result in inefficiency and wasted capacities cost. Thus an autonomic capacity management approach is therefore proposed in this paper, in order to overcome such issues as regards. Firstly we survey recent researches related in deep, and find that they all lack of consideration on computing node's personality which is crucial to solve job submission and is probable to lead submitted jobs into pending in case of there are insufficient computing nodes associated to this personality. Afterward we present our measures focused on autonomic capacity management by taking advantage of Cloud insight to provision capacities dynamically on demand. Such measures are capable of selfadaptively adjusting cluster capacities to form different personalities for varying job submission, by the repurposeability to coordinate capacities from the idle personality with lower running jobs to the other with higher demand on pending jobs. Finally we verify that, proposals in this paper are significantly in achieving optimized throughput by reducing the number of pending jobs in cost-efficiency, with a couple of simulations.","","978-1-4673-1538-8","","10.1109/CSNT.2012.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200733","Autonomic;Cloud Computing;High Performance Computing;High Throughput;Repurpose-ability","Adaptation models;Cloud computing;Conferences;IEEE Press;Organizations;Throughput;Virtual machine monitors","capacity management (computers);cloud computing;optimisation;parallel processing;pattern clustering","HPC cluster;autonomic capacity management;autonomic capacity management approach;capacity planning;cloud insight;computational capacities;cost-efficient throughput optimization;high performance computing;idle personality;job submission;pending jobs;scientific computing work;system throughput","","0","","20","","","11-13 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Questionnaires, based on the Technology Adoption Model version 3, were used and specifically targeted SMME's that have some form of ICT infrastructure. The relationships amongst the six TAM factors were tested. From the analysis it appears as if the primary reason respondents indicated for engaging with cloud computing services was to increase the flexibility and scalability of their IT resources. Reasons for not engaging with cloud services were unfamiliarity with the concept of cloud computing, unclear business models, risk of exposing corporate data, privacy concerns and high latency networks.","","978-1-905824-38-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701756","Adoption;Cloud Computing;Developing countries;Namibia;Small medium and micro enterprises (SMME's);Technology Acceptance Model","Cities and towns;Cloud computing;Companies;Computational modeling;Telecommunications","cloud computing;small-to-medium enterprises;trusted computing","ICT infrastructure;IT resources flexibility;IT resources scalability;Internet;Namibia;SMME;TAM factors;cloud computing adoption;cloud computing services;computing paradigm;customised data;data configuration;small medium and micro enterprises;technology adoption model version 3;trustworthy data","","0","","18","","","29-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques often employ execution offloading schemes that migrate a process between machines during its execution. In execution offloading, code regions to be executed on the server are decided statically or dynamically based on the complex analysis on execution time and process state transfer time of every region. Expectedly, the transfer time is a deciding factor for the success of execution offloading. According to our analysis, it is dominated by the total size of heap objects transferred over the network. But previous work did not try hard to minimize this size. Thus in this paper, we introduce novel techniques based on compiler code analysis that effectively reduce the transferred data size by transferring only the essential heap objects. The experiments exhibit that the reduced size positively influences not only the transfer time itself but also the overall effectiveness of execution offloading, and ultimately, improves the performance of our mobile cloud computing significantly in terms of execution time and power consumption.","","978-1-4673-4573-6","978-1-4673-4574-3","10.1109/PerCom.2013.6526710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526710","Cloud Computing;Code Analysis;Compiler;Execution Offloading;Mobile Computing;Smartphone","Cloud computing;Instruction sets;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Servers;Smart phones","cloud computing;mobile computing;power aware computing;program compilers;smart phones","cloud server;compiler code analysis;dynamic execution offloading;execution time;mobile cloud computing;power consumption;smartphone;transfer time","","6","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud Computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks, because most of Cloud Computing systems provide services to so many people who are not proven to be trustworthy. Therefore, a Cloud Computing system needs to contain some Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) for protecting each Virtual Machine(VM) against threats. In this case, there exists a tradeoff between the security level of the IDS and the system performance. If the IDS provide stronger security service using more rules or patterns, then it needs much more computing resources in proportion to the strength of security. So the amount of resources allocating for customers decreases. Another problem in Cloud Computing is that, huge amount of logs makes system administrators hard to analyse them. In this paper, we propose a method that enables Cloud Computing system to achieve both effectiveness of using the system resource and strength of the security service without trade-off between them.","1738-9445","978-1-4244-8830-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745874","Cloud Computing;Cooperative IDS;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Multilevel IDS","","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;cyber attacks;log management;multilevel intrusion detection system;virtual machine","","8","","","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researches have been done to establish and maintain the trust relationship in cloud. Remote attestation is one of the most important feature of trusted computing. But conventional ways of remote attestation can only attest to the presence of a particular binary. They cannot measure program behavior. Existing dynamic remote attestation technologies can solve some of these problems. But they are not suitable for cloud computing when users lose their control over their critical data and business processes. In our opinion, cloud should give controls back to the users at some extent. So we propose TBVMM, a novel mechanism for cloud computing to fill the trust gap between the infrastructure and upper software stacks.

The ASP market is largely driven by the increasing popularity of browser-based computing and the growing tendency for companies to outsource mission-critical functions. Advantages of the ASP model include reduced installation and support requirements, instant updates and synchronization, mass customization, and universal accessibility. Despite the obvious benefits, the ASP model has not yet gained momentum in power engineering, where most applications still conform to the traditional, standalone, three-tier architecture. The methodology featured in this article takes a traditional engineering application and Web-enables it for the ASP market.

HPC can improve todaypsilas key grid operation functions like state estimation and contingency analysis and reduce the solution time from minutes to seconds, comparable to SCADA measurement cycles. HPC also enables the integration of dynamic analysis into real-time grid operations. Dynamic state estimation, look-ahead dynamic simulation and real-time dynamic contingency analysis would be three crucial dynamic functions in future control centers. HPC provides opportunities for developing better decision support tools, which also need HPC support to handle large volume of data and large number of cases.

Most cloud providers offer two types of payment plans to the user, i.e., reservation and on-demand. The reservation plan is typically cheaper than the on-demand plan but reservation plan has to be provisioned in advance. Reserving the resources would be straightforward if the actual computing demand (e.g., job processing) is known in advance. However, in reality, the actual computing demand can be observed only at the point of actual usage. Therefore, it is difficult to reserve the correct amount of resources during the reservation to meet the computing demands of the users. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary optimal virtual machine placement (EOVMP) algorithm with a demand forecaster. First, a demand forecaster predicts the computing demand. Then, EOVMP uses this predicted demand to allocate the virtual machines using reservation and on-demand plans for job processing. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated by simulations and numerical studies. The evaluation result shows that the EOVMP algorithm can provide the solution close to the optimal solution of stochastic integer programming (SIP) and the prediction of the demand forecaster is of reasonable accuracy.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763426","Cloud Computing;demand forecasting;evolutionary algorithms","Cloud computing;History;Kalman filters;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Smoothing methods;Virtual machining","cloud computing;evolutionary computation;optimisation;resource allocation;virtual machines","cloud computing;computing demand;demand forecasting;evolutionary optimal virtual machine placement;ondemand payment plan;reservation payment plan;stochastic integer programming","","12","","23","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, unlike other alternative computing paradigms such as DNA computing and quantum computing, chaos computing presents a framework which one day might be appropriate for a general purpose machine.","0278-6648","","","10.1109/MP.2005.1462459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1462459","","Bifurcation;Brain modeling;Chaos;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Logistics;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Physics;Rhythm;Stochastic systems","chaos;logic gates","aperiodic long-term behavior;chaos computing paradigm;chaotic system dynamics;silicon-based computing architectures","","3","1","3","","","April-May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Along with this migration to web services has come a push for companies to adopt utility computing. Much like traditional infrastructure utilities, such as gas and electricity, utility or cloud computing seeks to abstract the supply of computing services from concerns of everyday users. Today, security and privacy concerns may represent the biggest hazards to moving services to external clouds. With cloud computing, data is stored and delivered over the Internet. The owner of the data does not control, and typically does not even know, the location of the data. There is a real chance that the owner's data could rest on the same resources as a competitor's application and data.

It is based on WIP, Web services session initiation protocol, for real-time service-oriented communication over IP. It integrates the emerging mobile endpoint platform, Android, from Google's initiative of open handset alliance (OHA). The WIP component of WIPdroid supports Web services based communication over IP. But most importantly, it transforms WIPdroid into a mobile SOA Web services endpoint. Applications developed on WIPdroid can be exposed and enabled by two-way Web services. This makes WIPdroid well suited for distributed computing and SOA based applications, such as communication enabled business process (CEBP) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). It also leads to a new type of dual-mode phone, with one communication mode from the binding with the physical mobile environment, e.g. GSM, CDMA, 3G, etc., and one fully web services enabled, service-oriented communication over IP mode from WIP. A prototype WIPdroid mobile computing platform is developed and tested. In order to support advance Web services capabilities on mobile endpoints, we developed an endpoint-edition of two-way Web services application proxy (2SAP) which has a small memory footprint (2-3 MB) and can be hosted on a mobile endpoint/handset, e.g. smart phone and PDA.","","978-0-7695-3283-7","","10.1109/SCC.2008.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578526","2SAP;Android;Open Handset Alliance;VoIP;WIP;WIPdroid;Web Services;service-oriented communication","Application software;Business communication;Distributed computing;GSM;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Service oriented architecture;Telephone sets;Web services","Web services;mobile computing;protocols;software architecture","WIP;WIPdroid;Web services application proxy;Web services session initiation protocol;communication enabled business process;distributed services computing;dual-mode phone;mobile distributed computing platform;open handset alliance;real-time communication;real-time service-oriented communication;service-oriented communication;software-as-a-service","","5","","21","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge in developing an application on computing environment like that becomes even greater. In this paper, we propose an approach to unify the programming paradigms in Grid computing and GPGPU computing as well as further our investigation on the performance of an application developed on such environment. To maximize its efficiency, the grid application is developed based on multi-level parallelism together with multi-level topology-aware techniques and the Global Arrays toolkit. We have successfully implemented the grid application with the proposed approach and the performance of the application depends directly on how the computing loads are distributed over those resources.

With the emergence of the cloud computing paradigm, there will be an increased reliance on wireless communication from portable computing devices to more powerful centralized servers. This paradigm shift to `thin-clients' presents an opportunity to make portable computing more sustainable by shifting more functionality to centralized servers. Reduced functionality needed on these devices could mean a slower rate of hardware replacement. This could significantly cut the electronic waste that is currently attributed to the frequent replacements of these devices. One of the challenges in such a paradigm shift to thin portable clients through reduced local computation would be the additional burden imposed on the wireless communication technologies used. Wireless communication technologies must be improved to handle the additional burden that will be imposed. Any proposed wireless technology must also be energy-efficient to maximize the operating life time of these battery operated, energy-constrained devices. Software approaches to achieve energy-efficient operation are preferable as they reduce the dumping of existing hardware due to upgrades or replacements, and help reduce electronic waste.

A QoS based middleware is needed to integrate the existing technologies to develop pervasive computing applications. The use of multiple agents (in patterns such as master-slave and embassy) are not suitable for such applications, since these patterns are based on point-to-point communication and the coordination among the agents about the context information will create a lot of network traffic resulting in wastage of bandwidth that is a precious resource for mobile computing applications. An architecture to simplify this task (known as AWMG - agentspace with multicast groups), based on IP multicast messaging, has been designed and implemented.

Processes running these applications may well demand unpredictable requirements and changes to system configuration and capabilities at runtime, thereby requiring fast system response without sacrificing the transparency and integrity of the reconfigured empowered system that is running on a heterogeneous platform. While a challenge in and of itself, platform heterogeneity is both useful and instrumental in the handling of unpredictable requests. The realization of such a dynamically reconfigurable and heterogeneous HPC cluster system for exascale computing requires a model to guide running processes to determine if they need empowerment of the current cluster, and if yes, by how much. To show the feasibility of empowerment of traditional HPC clusters for exascale computing, we have selected Beowulf as a noble candidate cluster and present a mathematical model for the empowerment of Beowulf clusters for exascale computing (EBEC). We have developed the model in line with Beowulf's cluster approach and by using vector space algebra. In contrast to traditional hardware-oriented approaches to improvise the performance of clusters, we use a software approach to the development of the proposed model by emphasizing processes, which act as the creators of the cluster and thus should decide on system (re)configuration, as the principal building blocks of the system.

We notice that recent literature in the field prioritizes the administration of resource provisioning and the allocation algorithms for an energy-efficient management of cloud computing environments. Security metrics can be seen as tools for providing information about the security status of a certain environment. With that in mind, we tackle the management of cloud computing security by using GQM methodology to develop a cloud computing security metrics hierarchy. The main goal of the proposed hierarchy is to produce a security index that describes the security level accomplished by an evaluated cloud computing environment. In a second step, this security index is used to compute an allocation index that helps in setting management priorities with a security bias. We also present a methodology for cloud computing management using security as a criterion.","","978-1-4673-5163-8","978-1-4673-5162-1","10.1109/LatinCloud.2012.6508157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508157","","","cloud computing;power aware computing;security of data;software metrics","GQM methodology;allocation algorithms;allocation index;cloud computing management;cloud computing security metrics hierarchy;energy-efficient management;resource provisioning algorithms;security bias;security criteria;security index;security status;underused resources","","1","","27","","","26-27 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As cloud computing becomes more widespread, the allocation of network and computing resources will be an issue. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention paid to the resource (CPU processing time and bandwidth) estimation in the cloud networks, which helps to connecting users to the cloud. This paper presents a formal analysis of modeling resource (CPU time) estimation in cloud computing, considering private cloud. The estimation model is based on Linear Least Square Regression (LLSR) method. The performance is measured for different applications in a cloud environment, which is setup and tested for resource estimation of user's frequent applications to be processed in the cloud. The estimation times given by LLSR are compared with other allocation algorithms like WFQ and SWFQ. Though the performances of WFQ and SWFQ are initially matching with the actual CPU time, they are not giving better estimates for the later applications. LLSR gives better estimates which match almost with the actual allocation for all applications.","","978-1-4799-3447-8","","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6921971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921971","Cloud Computing;Cloud Data storage;Resource Estimation and Scheduling Model for processing","Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation","cloud computing;data privacy;least squares approximations;regression analysis;resource allocation;scheduling","CPU time;LLSR method;SWFQ algorithm;WFQ algorithm;cloud computing;computing resource;data center energy use;linear least square regression;network resource;office based computing;private cloud;resource allocation;resource estimation;scheduling","","0","","20","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing of user's individual and diverse requirements, multi-tenancy has been the main delivery model for SaaS applications in future. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to the complex application development, application components had become modularization and fine-grained. Thus, new applications can be built through assembling those components quickly and agilely. So service composition for multi-tenant is the key to build application flexibly. This paper proposes a service granularity space for multi-tenant service composition based on granularity computing, which provides a semantic basis for multi-tenant service composition. The service granularity space supports the characteristic of hierarchy, inheritance, evolved correlation and versioning, effectively responding to the challenge of service composition for cloud computing SaaS applications. On the one hand, the service granularity space makes it possible to change disorder services into the hierarchy and ordered clustering services, and on the other hand, it makes it easy to develop multi-tenant SaaS applications by combining customization and evolution according to individual and diverse requirements. Our final experiments further demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of our proposed approaches.","","978-1-4799-5065-2","","10.1109/SCC.2014.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6930594","cloud computing;granularity computing;multi-tenant;service composition;service granularity space","Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Correlation;Quality of service;Semantics;Software as a service","cloud computing;configuration management;granular computing;inheritance;object-oriented programming;software maintenance;systems analysis","SaaS applications;application component modularization;cloud computing;complex application development;component assembly;customization;delivery model;evolution;evolved correlation;fine-grained application components;flexible application building;granularity computing;hierarchy;inheritance;multitenancy;multitenant service composition;ordered clustering services;semantic basis;service granularity space;user requirements;versioning","","0","","12","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each user requests cloud computing system for use of resources. If the system is busy, then user needs to wait until current user finishes the job. This may result in waiting time increase and drop of request Thus, cloud computing service provider needs tools to evaluate and reduce waiting and processing times. In the paper, each request is assumed to consist of several independent sub-requests according to the number of virtual cloud servers in the system. All sub-requests of the same request arrive simultaneously and each server receives exactly one sub-request in its queue. One of the main performance measures of cloud computing system is a maximum waiting and processing time of all sub-requests, which is called response time of the request. In order to evaluate this characteristic, we develop a model in terms of queuing system with multiple queues and batch arrivals.

A major problem of these applications is that users have to sacrifice performance requirements in order to satisfy storage capacity requirements in a conventional computing environment. Further performance improvement is impeded by the physical nature of these storage media, even if state-of-the-art I/O optimizations are employed. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-storage resource architecture that can satisfy both performance and capacity requirements by employing multiple storage resources. Compared to the traditional single-storage resource architecture, our architecture provides a more flexible and reliable computing environment. It can bring new opportunities for high-performance computing as well as inheriting state-of-the-art I/O optimization approaches that have already been developed. We also develop an application programming interface (API) that provides transparent management and access to various storage resources in our computing environment. As I/O usually dominates the performance in I/O-intensive applications, we establish an I/O performance prediction mechanism which consists of a performance database and a prediction algorithm to help users better evaluate and schedule their applications.

Therefore, it is a big challenge and pivotal issue to design an efficient job scheduling algorithm for implementation in the real grid system. Various works has been done by many researchers, still further analysis and research needs to be done to design new techniques and improve the performance of scheduling algorithm in grid computing. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient job scheduling algorithm to maximize the resource utilization and minimize processing time of the jobs. The proposed job scheduling is based on job grouping concept taking into account memory constraint together with other constraints such as processing power, Bandwidth, expected execution and transfer time requirements of each job. These very constraints are taken at job level rather than at group level.

The second problem in cloud computing is number of users can use the service but it makes the admin to analyze the log. In this paper ,we propose the multilevel intrusion detection system and log audit for detecting the attacks and maintain the security level and effectiveness of the system. The intrusion detection system is based on data mining techniques and anomaly detection method.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508322","Cloud Computing;Cooperative IDS;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Multi- level IDS","Cloud computing;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","cloud computing;data mining;pattern classification;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;Internet computing;anomaly detection method;cloud computing;data mining technique;log audit;multilevel intrusion detection system;network activity classification schema;virtual machine","","0","","9","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is proposed to overcome the limited resources of mobile systems. However, when users access MCC through wireless networks, cellular network is likely to be overloaded and Wi-Fi connectivity is intermittent. Therefore, device-to-device (D2D) communication is exploited as an alternative for MCC. An important issue in exploring D2D communication for MCC is how users can detect and utilize the computing resources on other mobile devices. In this paper, we propose two mobile cloud access schemes: optimal and periodic access schemes, and study the corresponding performance of mobile cloud computing (i.e., mobile cloud size, node's serviceable time percentage, and task success rate). We find that optimally, node's serviceable time percentage and task success rate approach 1. Using more practical periodic access scheme, node's serviceable time percentage and task success rate are determined by the ratio of contact and inter-contact time between two nodes.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883656","","Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Performance evaluation;Smart phones;Wireless communication","cloud computing;mobile computing;smart phones;telecommunication congestion control","cellular network;computing resources;device-to-device communication;mobile cloud computing;node serviceable time;periodic access method;smart phones","","0","","16","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Autonomic Computing Systems (ACS) is becoming more real and visible in present-day computing world, thus creating a context-aware-ubiquitous computing environment. Established IT Industry leaders have embraced this approach and a great deal of research and development is happening upon this area. Today, systems have grown large accommodating interconnecting complex technologies and practices. This has given rise to the demand of enormous human-skills in low-level-guidance area, engaged in IT support and system maintenance related tasks. Autonomic Systems have the capability of configuring, healing, optimizing and protecting themselves. These Self-managed systems have started becoming part of large enterprises, exhibiting autonomic behaviour and tendency for self-adaptability. Such systems could be part of a heterogenous - enterprise environment and capable of serving at any level ranging from a simple autonomic component to an enterprise-wide application. Autonomic systems, with the support of more open industry standards can change the way systems behave and respond today. This paper describes the basic concept of autonomic computing by relating autonomic nervous system characteristics. In addition to this, the paper describes a very general case of autonomic detection in computer networks, a self-protecting implementation using Intel Active Management Technology (AMT).","","978-1-4244-5401-3","978-1-4244-5402-0","10.1109/DeSE.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395120","AMT;Autonomic;Configuring;Detection;Healing;Optimizing;Protecting;Self;Self-Defence","Application software;Autonomic nervous system;Computer network management;Educational institutions;Humans;Neurons;Paper technology;Protection;Research and development;Technology management","fault tolerant computing;self-adjusting systems;ubiquitous computing","Intel active management technology;autonomic computing paradigm;autonomic computing systems;autonomic systems;context-aware-ubiquitous computing environment;self-managed systems;support system development","","4","","9","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea of using the concept of quantum computing for processing the big data is suggested. Quantum computing is the advanced computing technology where we think ahead of our conventional binary bits. This is based on the quantum physics which states that a material can be at more than one place at a time. This concept, when used in our conventional computing systems, will have the third bit called the superimposed bit that can be in two states at a time. The term big data is used to refer to the huge amounts of data collected. The data being collected is increasing exponentially. According to a study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, the data volume is growing 40% every year; and with the increasing number of users and research areas, one can expect much more growth in the data volume. With this kind of growing data, the need arises for faster processing and analysis methods giving better performance to the end users and the analytics. In this paper, a new algorithm, named as PQ-Key, is proposed for processing the big data using quantum computing.","","","978-1-84919-868-4","10.1049/cp.2013.2481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851528","Big data;File system;Hadoop;Map Reduce;Quantum Computing","","Big Data;quantum computing","Big Data processing;McKinsey Global Institute;PQ key algorithm;computing technology;data volume;key generation algorithm;quantum computing;quantum physics;superimposed bit","","0","","","","","27-28 Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This position paper advocates that gamification is potentially a means to increase people engagement and retention in volunteer cloud computing projects. As an initial step to reach a systematic application of gamification in such projects, we study the relationship between game mechanics and different categories of volunteers and propose a preliminary mapping that relates these two aspects.","","","","10.1109/UCC.2014.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027564","gamification mechanics;volunteer classes;volunteer cloud computing","Avatars;Cloud computing;Collaboration;Conferences;Educational institutions;Games;Planning","cloud computing;computer games;cost reduction","computing resources;gamification;operational cost reduction;volunteer cloud computing","","0","","8","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cloud computing, resources can be seen as a utility or commodity. Thus, cloud computing creates the possibility for a media content provider to increase its monetary profit by offering (renting out) the idle resources at its data-center to users of other communities. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. Firstly, we introduce our innovative system design that enables the media content provider to exploit the excessive resources available at its data-centre using cloud computing.

Considering that fundamental performance benchmarking is the strategy of early-stage evaluation of new Cloud services, we followed the Cloud Evaluation Experiment Methodology (CEEM) to benchmark GCE and also compare it with Amazon EC2, to help understand the elementary capability of GCE for dealing with scientific problems. The experimental results and analyses show both potential advantages of, and possible threats to applying GCE to scientific computing. For example, compared to Amazon's EC2 service, GCE may better suit applications that require frequent disk operations, while it may not be ready yet for single VM-based parallel computing. Following the same evaluation methodology, different evaluators can replicate and/or supplement this fundamental evaluation of GCE. Based on the fundamental evaluation results, suitable GCE environments can be further established for case studies of solving real science problems.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753771","Cloud Services Evaluation;Google Compute Engine;Public Cloud Service;Scientific Computing","Australia;Benchmark testing;Cloud computing;Google;Measurement;Standards;Throughput","benchmark testing;cloud computing;scientific information systems;software performance evaluation","CEEM;GCE scientific capabilities;Google compute engine performance;cloud computing;cloud evaluation experiment methodology;computationally intensive tasks;early-stage evaluation;fundamental performance benchmarking;high-performance tasks;public cloud services;scientific computing","","0","","29","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work represents the comprehensive evaluation of Nebula using NUTTCP, HPCC, NPB, I/O, and MPI function benchmarks as well as four applications representative of the NASA HPC workload. Specifically, we compare Nebula performance on some of these benchmarks and applications to that of NASA's Pleiades supercomputer, a traditional HPC system. We also investigate the impact of virtIO and jumbo frames on interconnect performance. Overall results indicate that on Nebula (i) virtIO and jumbo frames improve network bandwidth by a factor of 5x, (ii) there is a significant virtualization layer overhead of about 10% to 25%, (iii) write performance is lower by a factor of 25x, (iv) latency for short MPI messages is very high, and (v) overall performance is 15% to 48% lower than that on Pleiades for NASA HPC applications.

In this context, the convergence of grid computing and peer-to-peer (P2P) computing seems natural. However, grid infrastructures are generally available as a hierarchical federation of SAN-based clusters interconnected by high-bandwidth WANs. In contrast, P2P systems usually run on the Internet, on top of random, generally flat network topologies. This difference may lead to the legitimate question of how adequate are the P2P communication mechanisms on hierarchical grid infrastructures. Answering this question is important, since it is essential to efficiently exploit the particular features of grid networking topologies in order to meet the constraints of scientific applications. This paper evaluates the communication performance of the JXTA P2P platform over high-performance SANs and WANs, for both J2SE and C bindings. We discuss these results, then we propose and evaluate several techniques able to improve the JXTA's performance on such grid networking infrastructures.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-1693-6","978-1-4244-1694-3","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536338","","Bandwidth;Convergence;DSL;Delay;Grid computing;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Storage area networks;Wide area networks","grid computing;peer-to-peer computing","P2P computing;grid computing;grid networking infrastructures;peer-to-peer computing","","1","","28","","","14-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Grid takes advantage of Internet as an universal communication platform to carry messages. Basically, Internet doesn't guarantee loss-free and ordered transmission, hence, the Grid should keep the cause and effect of events by itself for the correct order of command invocation in the remote hosts. The ordering issue arises when the messages travel across the networks with unpredictable delay. Recent researches study the security and resource control issues but doesn't study the requirements of communication platform in the Grid. In this paper, we propose a Causal Ordered Grid (COG) architecture and implement it to study the performance issues when the Grid is built over worldwide networks. The COG provides a novel service model to the applications with time-sensitive and causal ordering transportation. From our experiments, the design of the Grid middleware should use a causal-ordered, time-sensitive transportation rather than TCP.

Even though it enables us to dynamically provide servers with the ability to address a wide range of needs, this paradigm brings forth many new challenges for the data security and access control as users outsource their sensitive data to clouds, which are beyond the same trusted domain as data owners. A fundamental problem is the existence of insecure information flows due to the fact that a service provider can access multiple virtual machines in clouds. Sensitive information may be leaked to unauthorized customers and such critical information flows could raise conflict-of-interest issues in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an approach to enforce the information flow policies at Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer in a cloud computing environment. Especially, we adopt Chinese Wall policies to address the problems of insecure information flow. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype system based on Eucalyptus open source packages to show the feasibility of our approach.

The increase in virtualization and usage of virtual machines (VM) in cloud computing environment has attracted a lot of attention from the computer security research community on the potential treats that could occurs from vast use of virtual machines in cloud computing. In this paper, methods for detecting VM using remote IP and ICMP packet timestamp detection methods and the timestamp behavior are studied, tested and investigated to determine either the problem still exist in high performance cloud computing infrastructure. The results from this study shows that there were distinguishable differences in the timestamp replies behaviors received from VM and nonVM machines even in a high performance private cloud computing environment. These results prove a significant potential that timestamp detection method could be exploited by malware as a VM detection method even in high performance cloud computing infrastructure.

This issue is especially difficult since cloud computing relies by nature on a complex splitting into many layers. From a technical point of view, most cloud computing platforms exploit virtualization, which implies that they are split into 3 layers: hosts, virtual machines and applications. From an administration point of view, they are split into 2 layers: the cloud provider who manages the hosting center and the customer who manages his application in the cloud. This paper analyses the implementation of fault tolerance in such a complex cloud computing environment with a focus on autonomic repair. We show that in most of current approaches, fault tolerance is exclusively handled by the provider or the customer which leads to partial or inefficient solutions, while collaborative solutions are much promising. We illustrate this discussion with experiments where exclusive and collaborative fault tolerance solutions are implemented in an autonomic cloud infrastructure that we prototyped.","","978-1-4673-1549-4","","10.1109/CITS.2012.6220386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220386","Cloud Computing;Fault tolerance;Virtualisation","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Maintenance engineering;Sensors","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;groupware;virtualisation","application layer;autonomic cloud infrastructure;autonomic repair;cloud computing environment;cloud computing fault tolerance;cloud provider;collaborative fault tolerance solutions;collaborative solutions;host layer;hosting center;virtual machine layer;virtualization","","3","","14","","","14-16 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have proposed a closed-loop affective computing system, which includes affect recognition, affect modeling, and affect control. Because emotions include both intra-personal uncertainty, which is the uncertainty a person has about an emotion, and inter-personal uncertainty, which results from the fact that different people have different perceptions and expressions of the same emotion, it is promising to use fuzzy sets and systems, especially type-2 fuzzy sets and systems, to handle these uncertainties in an affective computing system. This paper introduces four applications of affective computing, reviews some recent advances on the application of fuzzy sets and systems to affect recognition, modeling, and control, and points out some new research directions.

An important feature of the approach is that it schedules compute-intensive tasks so that the workload of Grid systems achieves balanced as soon as possible. From simulation results, the approach can scale to a large number of nodes and has a fast task convergence rate, maintaining high Grid utilization and good capability of balanced workload.","","978-1-4577-0885-5","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051735","Computing Field scheduling;Grid computing;decentralized;scalability;workload balance","Computational modeling;Convergence;Grid computing;Peer to peer computing;Processor scheduling;Scalability;Scheduling","grid computing;physics;scheduling","balanced workload;compute-intensive tasks;computing field scheduling;fast task convergence rate;fully decentralized scheduling approach;gravitational field;grid computing;grid utilization;local information;physics","","2","","13","","","22-23 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We wish to promote the use of the Cloud in order to facilitate energy savings and job creation opportunities.

In this paper we present a proactive Fault Tolerance (FT) approach to HPC systems in the cloud to reduce the wall clock execution time in the presence of faults. We develop a generic FT algorithm for HPC systems in the cloud. Our algorithm does not rely on a spare node prior to prediction of a failure. We analyze the dollar cost of provisioning spare nodes to assess the value of our approach. Our experimental results obtained from a real cloud execution environment show that the wall clock execution time of the computation-intensive applications in cloud can be reduced by as much as 30%.

High performance computing clusters scaling out fact indicates manageability will become more important than ever. Over time, a computer center tends facilitate multiple management frameworks from vendors to remote manage generations of heterogeneous HPC clusters to complete one task. The heterogeneous and scaling out computing info structure made HPCC/grid administration even more challenging and time consuming than before. Management interoperability is usually compromised or absent due to the heterogeneous environment. In order to solve this problem for the long run and further reduce the total cost of ownership, industry is defining the systems management architecture for server hardware (SMASH) initiative. The SMASH initiative is a suite of specifications, which standardize management interfaces and remote management architecture for heterogeneous computing environments. The suite of specifications includes unified command line protocol, resource discovery, and resource addressing and data model profiles. SMASH not only addresses complicated administration challenges as well as enables hardware independent remote manageability plus computing info structure status/performance aware job scheduling schemes and as a result, will bring HPC clusters/grid utilization rates to an even higher level.

Ubiquitous computing refers to making computers imperceptibly and pervasively available to the user in her environment. The notion of ubiquitous computing as a research issue itself dates back only to 1988 (Weiser, 1991), and the popular realization of this technology in the form of wireless mobile devices such as mobile telephones, personal digital assistants, Webpads, laptops, onboard automobile navigation systems, and other portable, networked computing technologies has only recently taken place. This paper begins from the premise that the emergent requirements of ubiquitous e-learning are very well suited to the flexibility and adaptability of a learning objects approach. The paper starts with a brief consideration of the characteristics and requirements of ubiquitous e-learning, and also explains the learning object approach and the standards and infrastructures used to support it. It then identifies challenges presented by the fact that these standards and infrastructures have not been developed with the requirements of ubiquitous e-learning in mind. The paper then suggests a number of adaptations or extensions to one specific and important e-learning standard - the standard for ""learning object metadata."" In discussing the application of this standard to ubiquitous e-learning, this paper makes significant reference to the CanCore guidelines for the implementation of learning object metadata in order to ensure maximum reusability and interoperability of data in this new context.","","0-7695-2300-5","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2005.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392857","","Best practices;Computer science education;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Portable computers;Telephony;Ubiquitous computing","computer aided instruction;distance learning;meta data;ubiquitous computing","Webpads;education;laptops;learning object metadata;mobile telephones;onboard automobile navigation systems;personal digital assistants;ubiquitous computing environments;ubiquitous e-learning;wireless mobile devices","","2","","20","","","8-12 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IEEE/ACS International Conference on","20041122","2004","","","91","","Summary form only given. Over the past few years the popularity of the Internet has been growing by leaps and bounds. However, there comes a time in the life of a technology, as it matures, where questions about its future need to be answered. The Internet is no exception to this case. Often called the ""next big thing"" in global Internet technology, grid computing is viewed as one of the top candidates that can shape the future of the Internet. Grid computing takes collective advantage of the vast improvements in microprocessor speeds, optical communications, raw storage capacity, World Wide Web and the Internet that have occurred over the last five years. Grid technology leverages existing resources and delays the need to purchase new infrastructure. With demand for computer power in industries like the life sciences and health informatics almost unlimited. Grid's ability to deliver greater power at less cost gives the technology tremendous potential. Ultimately the grid must be evaluated in terms of the applications, business value, and scientific results that it delivers, not its architecture. Biology provides some of the most important, as well as most complex, scientific challenges of our times. These problems include understanding the human genome, discovering the structure and functions of the proteins that the genes encode, and using this information efficiently for drug design. Most of these problems are extremely intensive from a computational perspective. One of the principal design goals for the grid framework is the effective logical separation of the complexities of programming a massively parallel machine from the complexities of bioinformatics computations through the definition of appropriate interfaces. Encapsulation of the semantics of the bioinformatics computations methodologies means that the application can track the evolution of the machine architecture and explorations of various parallel decomposition schemes can take place with minimal intervention from the domain experts or the end users. For example, understanding the physical basis of protein function is a central objective of molecular biology. Proteins function through internal motion and interaction with their environment. An understanding of protein motion at the atomic leve- l has been pursued since the earliest simulations of their dynamics. When simulations can connect to experimental results, the microscopic examinations of the different processes (via simulation) acquire more credibility and the simulation results can then help interpret the experimental data. Improvements in computational power and simulation methods facilitated by the grid framework could to lead to important progress in studies of protein structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics. This talk overviews the state of play and show how the grid can change the competitive landscape and, thus, become a potential ""disruptive"" technology.","","0-7803-8577-2","","10.1109/PERSER.2004.1356772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356772","","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Evolution (biology);Grid computing;Internet;Proteins","Internet;biology computing;grid computing;medical computing","Internet;World Wide Web;bioinformatics;biology computing;disruptive technology;grid computing;health-informatics;human genome;massively parallel machine","","0","","","","","19-23 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve both task execution and resource utilization efficiency, we present a task scheduling algorithm with resource attribute selection, which can select the optimal node to execute a task according to its resource requirements and the fitness between the resource node and the task. Experiment results show that there is significant improvement in execution throughput and resource utilization compared with the other three algorithms and four scheduling frameworks. In the scheduling algorithm comparison, the throughput is 77% higher than Min-Min algorithm and the resource utilization can reach 91%. In the scheduling framework comparison, the throughput (with work-stealing) is at least 30% higher than the other frameworks and the resource utilization reaches 94%.

Recent proposals for spin-based computing schemes may be differentiated as `all-spin' vs. hybrid, programmable vs. fixed, and, Boolean vs. non-Boolean. Allspin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small form-factor of nano-magnetic devices. However, circuit and system-level design techniques need to be explored that leaverage the specific spin-device characterisitcs to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nano-magnets can be exploited in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic. In such logic-styles, spin-devices may play the dual-role of computing as well as memory-elements that provide field-programmability. Spin-based threshold logic design is presented as an example. Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultra-low-voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing. Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing hardware for applicatons like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing, image-processing and data-conversion. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using coupled spin-torque nano oscillators for low-power non-Boolean computing.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800446","analog;coupled spin torque nano oscillators;logic;low power;neural networks;non-Boolean;programmable logic array;spin;threshold logic","CMOS integrated circuits;Logic gates;Magnetic domain walls;Magnetic domains;Magnetic tunneling;Neurons;Transistors","logic design;oscillators;programmable logic devices","CMOS;allspin logic-styles;brain-inspired computing;charge-based devices;circuit-level design techniques;complimentary metal oxide semiconductors;coupled spin-torque nano-oscillators;data conversion;energy efficiency;image processing;low-power nonBoolean computing;nanomagnetic devices;neuromorphic-computing;pattern matching;programmable logic;resistive memory;spin torque devices;spin-based computing schemes;spintronic phenomenon;system-level design techniques","","1","","38","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, investigation on the present cloud computing is mainly focused on the service side, while the security side has not been sufficiently looked at. Especially, the security perception from the social viewpoint of the unease of users toward cloud security has especially been insufficiently investigated. In this paper, we look into the various risks that can occur when a company uses cloud computing. That is, security from the viewpoint of the user in cloud computing is investigated. Concretely, the risk factors from this viewpoint in such cloud computing are comprehensively extracted with the risk breakdown structure (RBS) method. Furthermore, the risk factors that were extracted are analyzed and evaluated quantitatively.

But a few issues such as intermittent network connectivity, node's heterogeneity and resource constraints, must be addressed carefully. For them, a mobile agent approach is proposed in this paper. It delegates computation jobs to mobile agent, drives it to migrate on MANET and find nodes that have the resources. On each node, agent negotiates to use it resources and does its best to accomplish the jobs. This approach enables flexible handling of various resource sharing policies, and considers each node's resource capabilities. Moreover, it shields the dynamical network connectivity to mobile agent, thus enables logical mobility of grid applications over MANET","","0-7695-2695-0","","10.1109/GCCW.2006.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031569","","Ad hoc networks;Computer networks;Costs;Grid computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Portable computers;Resource management;Time factors","ad hoc networks;grid computing;mobile agents;resource allocation","flexible handling;grid computing;intermittent network connectivity;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobile agent;nontrivial computing capability;portable devices;resource constraints;resource sharing policy;wireless chip-set;wireless computing environment","","3","","14","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current approaches used in this systems consider QoS-requirements as quality, speed or costs in the resource allocation process and just select the resources that satisfy these requirements. However, the selection of a resource should not be based solely on whether a resource meets the QoS-requirements or not, because it does not imply that a task is processed satisfactory by the selected resource according to its content. To evaluate resources regarding this aspect, trust models can be used. But current trust models are not specifically designed to model trust in distributed computing environments, hence handling the dynamics of business or scientific workflows that constantly change their requirements and conditions. In this paper, we present approaches which improve current trust models according to the problems mentioned. Thereby, the degree of automation in the trust evaluation process will be increased as well.

The pay as you use nature of cloud computing services such as EC2 provided by Amazon wherein you pay only for the servers, server or part thereof that you use also makes it economically attractive. This paper is targeted at researchers in the field of genetics and biotechnology who wish to understand how cloud computing can contribute to their area of research. Bio-informatics tools are extensively used in biological research today. These tools can be utilized more efficiently and in a possibly more cost and time effective manner using cloud technology. High-throughput genomics leads to reams of data that cannot be processed by local research facility computers at the speed it is generated. This bottleneck has been overcome by the use of cloud computing to store and to process data in real time. Large datasets and applications for image analysis, data mining, protein folding, and gene sequencing can also be shared for collaborative research between facilities using clouds. This is a simpler approach than transferring such data. Clouds also provide applications such as Apache's Hadoop and Google's MapReduce for parallel computing (particularly useful for making services such as BLAST easier to deploy in a shorter time). Cloud computing with characteristics like multi-tenacity, scalability, low cost, virtualization, agility and empowerment of end users has made it possible to share the results of studies at much finer granularity, along with sharing scientific investigations at the level of individual data points. Cloud technology can contribute significantly in areas such as biodiversity informatics and the study of human genetic variation and disease. We discuss these possibilities, the challenges in realizing the potential for application of cloud technology - n biological sciences, and the work being done to overcome these challenges.","","978-1-4673-4415-9","","10.1109/ICCCTAM.2012.6488081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488081","bioinformatics;biological research;biotechnology;cloud computing","","bioinformatics;biotechnology;cloud computing;data mining;genetics;proteins","Amazon;BLAST;EC2;biodiversity informatics;bioinformatics tools;biological research;biotechnology;cloud computing services;cloud technology;collaborative research;data mining;gene sequencing;genetics;high-throughput genomics;image analysis;information processing;information sharing;information storage;protein folding;virtualization","","0","","42","","","8-10 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It minimizes the response time and improves the resource utilization rate. Resource utilization is a common basement to achieve the overall efficiency in the Grid environment. Rejection Rate is one of the important factors in identifying the performance of resource in the Grid environment. Static and dynamic load balancing also discussed in this paper. Both balancing methods are having pros and cons. For the discussion, two important factors have been considered here, Utilization and Rejection Rate.

As it is difficult to test new mechanism in real cloud computing environment and researchers often cannot reach the real cloud environment, simulation to model the mechanism and evaluate the results is necessary. Simulating a data center avoids spending time and effort to configure a real testing environment. Moreover, as real machines are not used for testing purposes, their computational power can be allocated to profit-making applications.

This phenomenon is exacerbated when, as in global grid computing, the grid computing sites are not connected by dedicated network resources but share the same network infrastructure with other Internet services. This paper aims at showing the advantages of integrating grid computing fault tolerance schemes with next generation networks (NGNs) resilient schemes. Indeed, by combining the utilization of generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) resilient schemes, such as path restoration, and application or middleware layer fault tolerant schemes, such as service migration or replication, it is possible to guarantee the necessary QoS to the connections between grid computing sites while limiting the required network and computational resources.","","0-7803-9236-1","","10.1109/ICTON.2005.1505834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1505834","","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Fault tolerance;Grid computing;Hardware;Middleware;Next generation networking;Resilience;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;fault tolerant computing;grid computing;middleware;multiprotocol label switching;quality of service;routing protocols;system recovery","GMPLS;IP dynamic rerouting;Internet service;NGN;QoS;fault tolerance scheme;generalized multiprotocol label switching;grid computing;interservice connectivity;middleware;network resource;next generation network;quality of service;resilient scheme;software failure","","0","","18","","","3-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Mathematics and Computing","","","Aesthetic Computing","20120924","2006","","","227","227","In Aesthetic Computing, key scholars and practitioners from art, design, computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to the formal, abstract qualities of such structures--a beautiful proof, or an elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of aesthetics--from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative expression and pleasure--in the context of computer science. The assumption behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will benefit--""usability,"" for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional state--and new models of learning will emerge.Aesthetic Computing approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives. After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book looks at art and design, mathematics and computing, and interface and interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and ""the poesy of programming"" to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design.Contributors:James Alty, Olav W.

PARDISC is a parallel programming environment, which provides the needed transparency as a scalable OpenFrame Computing Model. PARDISC stands for PARallel and DIStributed Computing on a homogeneous network. It supports three models of computing by providing the functionalities required to view any homogeneous network as a Loosely Coupled Parallel Computer, Processor Pool Architecture, or Cluster of Workstations. PARDISC aims at providing a cost effective parallel and distributed programming environment to the academic and R&D institutions, since it employs the existing well established Local Area Network (LAN) and models it to support both the paradigms. This paper presents an overview of PARDISC along with its architecture and design. It discusses how PARDISC can be used to configure the network as a loosely coupled parallel machine, processor pool architecture, and distributed computing environment with Logical Network Connectivity.

This situation implies a novel local cloud computing paradigm in which mobile device can leverage nearby resources to facilitate task execution. In this paper, we implement a mobile local computing system based on indoor virtual cloud. This system mainly contains three key components: 1) As to application, we create a parser to generate the “method call and cost tree” and analyze it to identify resource-intensive methods. 2) As to mobile device, we design a self-learning execution controller to make offloading decision at runtime. 3) As to cloud, we construct a social scheduling based application-isolation virtual cloud model. The evaluation results demonstrate that our system is effective and efficient by evaluating CPU-intensive calculation application, Memoryintensive image translation application and I/O-intensive image downloading application.","1673-5447","","","10.1109/CC.2014.6827567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827567","application partition;dynamic offloading strategy;mobile local computing system;social scheduling;virtual cloud model","Androids;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Servers;XML","cloud computing;input-output programs;mobile computing;scheduling;virtual machines;virtualisation","CPU-intensive calculation application evaluation;bandwidth resources;computing resources;cost tree generation;indoor virtual cloud;input-output-intensive image downloading application;local cloud computing paradigm;memory-intensive image translation application;method call generation;mobile device;mobile local computing system;network development;network virtualization;parser creation;resource-intensive method identification;self-learning execution controller;smart cafe;social scheduling based application-isolation virtual cloud model;task execution","","0","","","","","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the most important aspect refers to security: while some cloud computing security issues are inherited from the solutions adopted to create such services, many new security questions that are particular to these solutions also arise, including those related to how the services are organized and which kind of service/data can be placed in the cloud.

However, there are challenges about effective load balancing for grid computing, because of the highly heterogeneous and complex computing environments, even though agents and agent-based grid computing approach are used. To solve the problems, in this paper, a concurrent negotiations model is presented, in which an auction is mapped into a one-to-many negotiation between one seller agent and many buyer agents in service-oriented contexts. Thus, the mechanism and process of concurrent negotiations are studied. An agent negotiates with many other agents and coordinates balance in grid computing resources. The results of exploratory evaluation show that this concurrent negotiations model has a advantage in achieving more and higher utility agreements than other models to optimize computing resources allocation","","1-4244-0475-4","","10.1109/COGINF.2006.365673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216388","agent;agent-based Grid Computing;concurrent negotiation","Centralized control;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Grid computing;Internet;Load management;Multiagent systems;Problem-solving;Protocols;Resource management","distributed processing;grid computing;multi-agent systems;resource allocation","agent-based grid computing;concurrent negotiation;load balancing;open distributed system","","0","","14","","","17-19 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The size of on-chip cache memory has also been consistently increasing to keep up with developments in implementation technology. However, some applications may not utilize full cache capacity and, on the contrary, require more computing resources. To efficiently utilize silicon real-estate on the chip, we exploit the possibility of using a part of cache memory for computational purposes to strike a balance in the usage of memory and computing resources for various applications. In an earlier part of our work, the idea of adaptive balanced computing (ABC) architecture was evolved, where a module of an L1 data cache is used as a coprocessor controlled by main processor. A part of an L1 data cache is designed as a reconfigurable functional cache (RFC) that can be configured to perform a selective core function in the media application whenever such computing capability is required. ABC architecture provides speedups ranging from 1.04x to 5.0x for various media applications. We show that a reduced number of cache accesses and lesser utilization of other on-chip resources, due to a significant reduction in execution time of application, will result in power savings. For this purpose, we first develops a model to compute the power consumed by the RFC while accelerating the computation of multimedia applications. The results show that up to a 60 percent reduction in power consumption is achieved for MPEG decoding and a reduction in the range of 10 to 20 percent for various other multimedia applications. Besides, beyond the discussions in earlier work on ABC architecture, we present a detailed circuit level implementation of the core functions in the RFC modules. Further, we go much further and study the impact of converting the conventional cache into RFC on both access time and energy consumption. The analysis is performed on a wide spectrum of cache organizations with size varying from 8KB to 256KB for varying set associativity.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2004.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327578","65;Index Terms- On-chip data cache;adaptive computing;cache access time;cache energy dissipation.;multimedia processing","Acceleration;Adaptive control;Cache memory;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Coprocessors;Energy consumption;Process control;Programmable control;Silicon","cache storage;multimedia computing;reconfigurable architectures;system-on-chip","MPEG decoding;adaptive balanced computing architecture;circuit level implementation;data cache;implementation technology;multimedia application;on-chip cache memory;on-chip computing resources;power consumption;reconfigurable functional cache;silicon real-estate","","4","","17","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So there is a need for a robust Fault Tolerant (FT) system in Cloud Computing. To better understand FT in Cloud Computing, it is essential to understand the different types of faults. In this paper, we highlight the basic concepts of fault tolerance by understanding the different FT policies like Reactive FT policy and Proactive FT policy and the associated FT techniques used on different types of faults.

DSs within USDM-PerComp autonomously form a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay. We present a Gnutella inspired distributed algorithm to support service discovery over the resulted P2P overlay, and further implement a service crawler using mobile agent techniques to perform the discovery and invocation. With the service crawler, service composition could be done automatically and spontaneously without any user concern. Besides, we develop a distributed JPEG encoding application to verify the practicability of our proposal. Our experience confirms the scalability and flexibility of USDM-PerComp.

This is the reason that people now think about cloud computing as a solution of the problem instead of implementing their own data warehouse system. This paper is about, how cloud computing environment can be established as an alternative of data warehouse system. It will also throw some light about better environment choice for the organizational need. Organizational data warehouse and EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) are discussed with different parameters like ROI, security, scalability, robustness of data, maintenance of system etc. Paper will help in comparative analysis of both the systems.","","978-93-80544-10-6","","10.1109/IndiaCom.2014.6828113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828113","Elastic Cloud Computing;IaaS;In-house data warehouse;SaaS and PaaS;cloud computing;data warehouse","Cloud computing;Data warehouses;Decision support systems;Hardware;Organizations;Standards organizations","cloud computing;data warehouses;decision support systems;organisational aspects;virtualisation","EC2;cost reduction;data warehouse deployment;data warehouse systems;elastic cloud computing;organizational data warehouse;organizational decision support system;organizational need;organizational systems;virtualization","","0","","14","","","5-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This P2P technology is started from file sharing, video streaming and P2P computing. Basically in this P2P computing, those who are in on-line all will act likes as a server or client. If they are having data segments then it will act as server otherwise clients. Generally the data segments are preserving at the peers in different levels such as hard cache and soft cache. Based on the popularity the video contents can be downloaded. Normally the most popular data segments are placed on the cache which is downloaded either from video server of from neighboring peers. There are so many of cache replacement algorithms have been introduced to replace the old data segments with newly arrived data segments. While arriving new data segments the old data segments removed from the queue i.e. cache, so the availability of the data content is presented very low. To overcome this problem multilevel cache is protecting the old segments in order to increase the speed. Generally P2P system the request will go at the neighbouring peer that particular neighbouring peer having is less connectivity then the client can receive the data segments slowly. Therefore overcoming this category of connectivity problem, we recommended bandwidth based cluster. After client registration, the video server build cluster based on bandwidth size. Once the request from client / server received immediately the video server finds highest bandwidth and LFU peer in their cluster and then service is redirected.","","","","10.1109/ICHCI-IEEE.2013.6887818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887818","Clustering;P2P computing;bandwidth based cluster;distributed computing;multilevel cache","Availability;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Educational institutions;Peer-to-peer computing;Servers;Streaming media","cache storage;distributed processing;pattern clustering;peer-to-peer computing","P2P computing;bandwidth based cluster;data segments;distributed computing;multilevel cache;peer-to-peer computing;video content managing","","0","","8","","","23-24 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, cloud computing has become one of the major trends in information technology. Built on top of virtualization technology, cloud computing systems can expand dynamically, contributed to the fact that the services deployed on clouds have remarkable differences with the traditional or distributed deployed ones. As a result, the state of art tools and methods used for dependability testing are not suitable for cloud computing systems. We design and implement a test bed, CloudTB, for testing the dependability of cloud computing systems. First, based on a highly efficient and extremely fast communication mechanism, CloudTB can guarantee a minimal time spent on dispatching the test commands. Second, CloudTB is able to target testing nodes in the dynamically expanding cloud computing systems with an accuracy of 100%, by taking advantages of SSH based authentication methods and HASH mapping mechanisms. Furthermore, CloudTB provides universal fault injection and stresses testing modules to test how the services and clouds perform when the environment and facilities are dynamically changing under massive requests. Finally, CloudTB is scalable enough to test thousands of nodes simultaneously and supports testing with test cases wrote by third parties. The evaluation results show that CloudTB is able to send more than 100 thousand and receive more than 40 thousand pieces of 1k-length message per second while testing million nodes simultaneously, with an accuracy of 100% for targeting. Thus we believe CloudTB is the perfect test bed with efficient, scalable, accurate, and viable support for testing the dependability of cloud computing systems.","","","","10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2015.7086956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086956","ZeroMQ;cloud computing;fault injection;software testing;stress testing","Circuit faults;Cloud computing;Protocols;Servers;Stress;Testing","cloud computing;program testing;virtual machines","CloudTB;HASH mapping mechanisms;SSH based authentication methods;communication mechanism;dependability testing;fault injection;information technology;software development cycle;virtual machine based cloud computing systems;virtualization technology","","0","","","","","25-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important tasks of the resource management is to achieve high system throughput. It can be done by finding the best match between the application needs and the available computing resources. Guaranteeing QoS in a non-deterministically shared heterogeneous environment is the main challenge of the matching task. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution to guarantee the quality of service in grid computing environment by using Active Database.

Three approaches have been proposed for mobile cloud applications: 1) extending the access to cloud services to mobile devices; 2) enabling mobile devices to work collaboratively as cloud resource providers; 3) augmenting the execution of mobile applications on portable devices using cloud resources. In this paper, we focus on the third approach in supporting mobile data stream applications. More specifically, we study the computation partitioning, which aims at optimizing the partition of a data stream application between mobile and cloud such that the application has maximum speed/throughput in processing the streaming data. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to study the partitioning problem for mobile data stream applications, where the optimization is placed on achieving high throughput of processing the streaming data rather than minimizing the make span of executions in other applications. We first propose a framework to provide runtime support for the dynamic partitioning and execution of the application. Different from existing works, the framework not only allows the dynamic partitioning for a single user but also supports the sharing of computation instances among multiple users in the cloud to achieve efficient utilization of the underlying cloud resources. Meanwhile, the framework has better scalability because it is designed on the elastic cloud fabrics. Based on the framework, we design a genetic algorithm to perform the optimal partition. We have conducted extensive simulations. The results show that our method can achieve more than 2X better performance over the execution without partitioning.","2159-6182","978-1-4673-2892-0","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253581","application partitioning;genetic algorithm;mobile cloud computing","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Throughput","cloud computing;genetic algorithms;mobile computing","cloud resource providers;cloud services;data stream applications;genetic algorithm;mobile cloud applications;mobile cloud computing;mobile data stream applications;portable devices","","8","","21","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Service composition mechanisms are being employed to deliver support to complex user tasks within service-oriented environments. The mechanism of combining two or more services together to form a complex service is known as service composition. Most of complex applications need the support of the transaction. This paper proposes a pervasive computing transaction service (Per_Comp_TS) for service composition in pervasive computing environment. The Per_Comp_TS can discover pervasive services dynamically to perform sub-transactions, execute coordination algorithms of the atomic or cohesion transaction for these services to achieve expected consistency, according to the type of a transaction. An ASM-based approach is proposed to model the coordination algorithms, and validates their correctness. The Per_Comp_TS can provide powerful ability to manage transaction and hide users from the complex process, and provide effective supports for pervasive applications.","","978-0-7695-3641-5","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223101","ASM;Pervasive Computing;Service Composition;Transaction","Application software;Assembly;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Computer science;Distributed computing;Energy management;Information analysis;Information science;Pervasive computing","finite state machines;transaction processing;ubiquitous computing","abstract state machine;atomic transaction;cohesion transaction;coordination algorithm;pervasive computing transaction service;service composition;service-oriented computing","","0","","19","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although centralized baseband pools are already investigated for the radio access network (RAN) to allow for efficient resource usage and advanced multicell algorithms, these technologies still require dedicated hardware and do not offer the same characteristics as cloud-computing platforms, i.e., on-demand provisioning, virtualization, resource pooling, elasticity, service metering, and multitenancy. However, these properties of cloud computing are key enablers for future mobile communication systems characterized by an ultradense deployment of radio access points (RAPs) leading to severe multicell interference in combination with a significant increase of the number of access nodes and huge fluctuations of the rate requirements over time.

These techniques often employ execution offloading schemes that migrate a process between machines during its execution. In execution offloading, code regions to be executed on the server are decided statically or dynamically based on the complex analysis on execution time and process state transfer costs of every region. Expectedly, the transfer cost is a deciding factor for the success of execution offloading. According to our analysis, it is dominated by the total size of heap objects transferred over the network. But previous work did not try hard to minimize this size. Thus in this paper, we introduce novel techniques based on compiler code analysis that effectively reduce the transferred data size by transferring only the essential heap objects and the stack frames actually referenced in the server. The experiments exhibit that the reduced size positively influences not only the transfer time itself but also the overall effectiveness of execution offloading, and ultimately, improves the performance of our mobile cloud computing significantly in terms of execution time and energy consumption.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2307293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746190","Mobile computing;cloud computing;code analysis;compilers;execution offloading;smartphone","Cloud computing;Instruction sets;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Servers;Smart phones","cloud computing;cost reduction;energy consumption;file servers;mobile computing;program compilers;smart phones","cloud servers;code regions;compiler code analysis;dynamic execution offloading;energy consumption;execution time;heap objects;mobile cloud computing;process state transfer cost;smartphones;stack frames;state transfer cost minimization","","1","","21","","2014-02-20","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software faults and environmental factors. Autonomic anomaly detection is crucial for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect anomalous cloud behaviors, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime cloud performance data. For different types of failures, the data display different correlations with the performance metrics. In this paper, we present a wavelet-based multi-scale anomaly identification mechanism, that can analyze profiled cloud performance metrics in both time and frequency domains and identify anomalous cloud behaviors. Learning technologies are exploited to adapt the selection of mother wavelets and a sliding detection window is employed to handle cloud dynamicity and improve anomaly detection accuracy. We have implemented a prototype of the anomaly identification system and conducted experiments on an on-campus cloud computing environment. Experimental results show the proposed mechanism can achieve 93.3% detection sensitivity while keeping the false positive rate as low as 6.1% while outperforming other tested anomaly detection schemes.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820866","Anomaly detection;Autonomic management;Cloud computing;Dependable systems;Wavelet analysis","Cloud computing;Detectors;Frequency-domain analysis;Hardware;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines;wavelet transforms","anomalous cloud behavior detection;automated anomaly detection;cloud computing systems;cloud dynamicity;cloud execution monitoring;frequency domains;learning technologies;mother wavelet selection;on-campus cloud computing environment;profiled cloud performance metrics analysis;runtime cloud performance data collection;self-managing cloud resources;sliding detection window;time domains;wavelet-based multiscale anomaly identification mechanism","","0","","62","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns.

In ubiquitous computing, compact devices embedded in environments provide various services. Their computational resources, such as their memory capacity and processing speed, are limited because of their compactness. Devices in ubiquitous environments have to accomplish various services under such severe restrictions. However, since the functions of conventional devices are fixed, they cannot be applied to providing various services. In this paper, we propose a device with alterable functions for ubiquitous computing. By changing the proposed device's functions according to the purpose of the system, it can be applied to many services. In addition, we used a rule-based programming language to make the device sufficiently flexible to describe the usage of its functions. Novelties of the proposed device are its alterable functions and flexible programming of these functions.","","978-0-7695-3427-5","","10.1109/UMC.2008.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4656550","Alterable-Function device;Ubiquitous Computing;rule-based processing","Acoustic sensors;Computer languages;Design engineering;Engines;Functional programming;Microprogramming;Multimedia computing;Pervasive computing;Temperature sensors;Ubiquitous computing","logic programming languages;ubiquitous computing","compact devices;flexible programming;memory capacity;rule-based programming language;ubiquitous computing","","1","","7","","","13-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we propose a novel service model: Flowable Service Model (FSM),which aims to provide appropriate services (as a flow) for users in any time and any place, and let them to enjoy ambient life empowered by cloud computing.

Running applications in virtualized environment incur performance overheads regarding to the virtualization functionalities like initialization virtual machine image, the booting time of virtual machine, starting, pausing and turning off the virtual machine. Virtualization functionality has implication on the host performance and when it is mixed with volunteer computing in order to undertake the execution of jobs, it becomes a serious challenge as volunteer computing aims to use public dedicated resources in an efficient manner to maximize the work done. In order to adopt virtualization technology in volunteer computing, the performance impact of virtualization on volunteer computing middleware needs to be distinguished. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the virtualization functionalities overhead by comparing the job application execution in two scenarios: 1) executing job application in a virtualized environment by using vboxwrapper (The latest BOINC virtualization approach) and 2) executing job application directly on the host OS. Based on the result, virtualization fashion imposed up to 5 minutes pre-execution overhead when three jobs performed in parallel. The storage overhead ranged from 13% to 26%, depending on the number of jobs that are executing in parallel. This amount of overhead for memory ranged from 6.5% to 20%.","","978-1-4799-4556-6","","10.1109/I4CT.2014.6914205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914205","BOINC;Overhead;Virtualization;Volunteer Computing","Central Processing Unit;Cloud computing;Computers;Grid computing;Servers;Virtual machining;Virtualization","operating systems (computers);parallel processing;virtual machines;virtualisation;volunteer computing","BOINC virtualization;Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing;OS;job application execution;operating system;parallel execution;storage overhead;vboxwrapper;virtual machine;virtualization implementation cost;volunteer computing","","0","","21","","","2-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Space services and grid nodes all are regarded as computing resources. Task assignment is implemented by two procedures with QoS-based scheduling algorithms. The above ideas have been applied in a group company for the simulation of third generation (3G) wireless systems, and it is found that a lightweight grid computing platform can be realized via GCFS.

In this paper, generalized trust negotiation (GTN) to establish trust relationship between strangers is presented, in which credential is exchanged only once, and then two parties exchanges secret key iteratively until trust negotiation succeeds or fails. GTN can avoid the heavy computational demands arising from the public key cryptography operations and needs less memory space to save credentials than those in traditional trust negotiation. In addition, GTN can prevent the vulnerability of man-in-the-middle attacks which the traditional trust negotiation has.","","978-0-7695-3290-5","","10.1109/CCCM.2008.375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609600","generalized trust negotiation;pervasive computing","Communication system control;Computer science;Control systems;Embedded computing;Information security;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Physics computing;Public key cryptography;Sensor systems","mobile computing;sensors;user interfaces","centralized trust certification;generalized trust negotiation;mobile users;pervasive computing;sensors;system resources;system services","","0","","9","","","3-4 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To realize such an attractive and feasible solution with the two features, we advocate a “participating fine-granular cloud computing platform” that a large number of personal or small company level resource suppliers participates in, configures and provides cloud computing. In particular, to efficiently search nearby resources among many and various ones in the platform, we propose Resource Breadcrumbs(RBC) as a key technology to provide in-network guidance capability autonomously for users' requests. This enables to supply users a smaller unit of resources: computing resource, memory resource, content, application etc. in comparison to traditional IaaS service. In the proposal, supplier-nodes distribute, around them, guidance information directed to themselves with dedicated control message, and additionally, the information may be logged along the trail of ACK message from central database server or supplier to user. The distributed information enables user to autonomously locate nearby resources. In addition, distributed management reduces computational load on central database and enables to build participating fine-granular cloud platform with lower cost.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883950","IaaS;Resource Breadcrumbs;cloud computing;fine-granular cloud;participating cloud","Cloud computing;Computers;Delays;Indexes;Resource management;Servers","cloud computing;computer networks;granular computing;resource allocation","ACK message;computational load;computing resource;dedicated control message;distributed information;distributed management;fine granular cloud computing platform;guidance information;in-network guidance;memory resource;resource breadcrumbs","","0","","17","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Breakthrough-quality scientific discoveries in the new millennium (such as those expected in computation biology and others), along with optimal engineering designs, have created a demand for High-End Computing (HEC) systems with sustained performance requirements at a petaflop scale and beyond. Despite the very pessimistic (if not negative) views on parallel computing systems that have prevailed in 1990s, there seems to be no other viable alternatives for such HEC systems. In this talk, we present a fresh look at the problems facing the design of petascale parallel computing systems. We review several fundamental issues that such HEC parallel computing systems must resolve. These issues include: execution models that support dynamic and adaptive multithreading, fine-grain synchronization, and global name-space and memory consistency. Related issues in parallel programming, dynamic compilation models, and system software design will also be discussed. Present solutions and future direction will be discussed based on (1) application demand (e.g. computation biology and others), (2) the recent trend as demonstrated by the HTMT, HPCS, and the Blue-Gene Cyclops (e.g. Cyclops-64) architectures, and (3) a historical perspective on influential models such as dataflow, along with concepts learned from these models.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419900","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computer architecture;Computer science;Concurrent computing;High performance computing;Parallel processing;System software","natural sciences computing;parallel processing;program compilers;storage management;synchronisation","High-End Computing system;dynamic compilation model;memory consistency;multithreading;parallel programming;petascale parallel computing system;synchronization;system software design","","0","","","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore the design of ubiquitous systems requires the mastering of many, often separated, engineering disciplines that span from advanced probability to logic, from human factors to cryptology and information security and to management of large projects. From an educational point of view, very few, if any, Universities are offering a comprehensive and methodical track that is able to provi- de students with a sufficient preparation that makes them able to cope with the challenges posed by the design of ubiquitous systems. In Europe an activity has started towards the identification of a MSc curriculum in Resilient Computing as properly providing a timely and necessary answer to requirements posed by the design of ubiquitous systems. To this aim, a Network of Excellence ReSIST - Resilience for Survivability in IST-was run from January 2006 to March 2009 (see http://www.resist-noe.org). In this presentation the results of ReSIST will be presented as well as the identified MSc curriculum in Resilient Computing, to share its experience and to involve a much larger, open and qualified community in the discussion of the proposed curriculum.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-3751-1","978-1-4244-3750-4","10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160867","","Computer networks;Embedded computing;Environmental factors;Fault tolerant systems;Mobile computing;Network servers;Pervasive computing;Psychology;Resilience;Resists","computer science education;software fault tolerance","ambient intelligence;complex information infrastructure;cryptology;dependable computing systems;embedded devices;engineering discipline;environmental disturbance;environmental perturbation;fault tolerant computing;information security;mobile computers;resilient computing;service delivery;ubiquitous systems","","2","","","","","23-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, a machine could be trained to acquire knowledge so that it would do the work (i.e. calculation and decision making) itself and leaves human do something else that is more important. In a ubiquitous multimodal multimedia (MM) computing system, the selection of appropriate media and modalities (i.e. devices) is based on user's context, user profile, and user's environment (a.k.a. pre-condition scenario). There are numerous possibilities of a pre-condition scenario and the available devices also changes depending on user's computing environment. Indeed, a machine learning (ML) component could be trained to ""remember"" all pre-condition scenarios, and each one's device selection (a.k.a. post-condition scenario). This ML component could also be trained to find a replacement to every missing or defective selected device. The ML component is integrated into a ubiquitous system making it available anytime, anywhere.

In this paper, we study the topology configuration and rate allocation problem in C-RAN with the objective of optimizing the end-to-end performance of MCC users in next generation wireless networks. An intrinsic issue related to such system is that only sub-optimal decisions can be made due to the fact that the channel state information is outdated. We employ a decision-theoretic framework to tackle this issue, and maximize the system throughput with constraints on the response latency experienced by each MCC user. Using simulation results, we show that, with the emergence of MCC and C-RAN technologies, the design and operation of future mobile wireless networks can be significantly affected by cloud computing, and the proposed scheme is capable of achieving substantial performance gains over existing schemes.","","","","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849260","Cloud radio access networks;mobile cloud computing systems","Cloud computing;Delays;Mobile communication;Physical layer;Radio access networks;Throughput;Wireless networks","cloud computing;decision theory;mobile computing;next generation networks;radio access networks;telecommunication network topology","C-RAN;MCC systems;channel state information;cloud radio access networks;decision-theoretic framework;mobile cloud computing systems;next generation wireless networks;rate allocation problem;response latency;system throughput maximization;topology configuration","","0","","19","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grids and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have emerged as popular platforms for the next generation parallel and distributed computing. In these environments, resources are geographically distributed, managed and owned by various organizations with different policies, and interconnected by wide-area networks or the Internet. This introduces a number of resource management and application scheduling challenges in the domain of security, resource and policy heterogeneity, fault tolerance, and dynamic resource conditions. In these dynamic distributed computing environments, it is hard and challenging to carry out resource management design studies in a repeatable and controlled manner as resources and users are autonomous and distributed across multiple organizations with their own policies. Therefore, simulations have emerged as the most feasible technique for analyzing policies for resource allocation.

The major concern in a grid computing system is the reliability, as a single node failure fails all running applications on the node. We proposed a fault-tolerance framework to improve the reliablity of a grid system. The proposed framework is novel in the sense that it uses the peer-to-peer replication model instead of a traditional client-server replication model, which reduces the replication time overhead and provides better degree of resiliency. Essentially, the checkpoint data file is split into chunks and distributed among a number of backup peers in parallel such that each chunk is replicated at two backup nodes. Moreover, the survival of the backup with the backup data redundancy in case of any one of the backup nodes in the group fails is also maintained. Detailed algorithms of modules of the complete framework are provided including group-forming, fault detection, replication, and fault recovery. Comparative performance evaluation of the replication time between the proposed peer-to-peer model and the client-server model has been conducted by using simulation over a wide range of chunk sizes and checkpoint data size. Our results show that, for a large enough chunk size, the replication time of the peer-to-peer replication model is reduced by half compared to that of the client-server model.","","978-1-4673-1920-1","","10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261983","Fault tolerance;Grid reliability;P2P backup","Computational modeling;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Peer to peer computing;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;fault tolerant computing;grid computing;peer-to-peer computing","P2P computing;backup nodes;backup peers;checkpoint data file size;chunk sizes;communication bandwidth;fault detection;fault recovery;grid computing system;grid system reliability improvement;group-forming;high-performance computing;node failure;peer-to-peer fault tolerance framework;peer-to-peer replication model;replication time overhead;replication time performance evaluation;resiliency degree;storage space","","0","","17","","","May 30 2012-June 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In grid environment resources are heterogeneous and geographically distributed. By receiving a resource request the resource discovery mechanism should return an appropriate resource if there exist one. Resource discovery is a challenging problem because of the heterogeneity and distribution of resources. The centralized and hierarchical resource discovery mechanisms are not suitable for large scale and dynamic resources. On the other hand peer to peer systems are successful in distributed computing because of their scalability and robustness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive peer to peer resource discovery algorithm using reinforcement learning for grid computing that can be used for multi resource requests. The algorithm achieves the most suitable node that can satisfy the requested resource by using the past experience of agents. We compare our model with random walk resource discovery through simulation and the results show that the proposed algorithm provides higher success rate, less message passing and shorter response time. Also the algorithm leads to load balancing in whole grid. According to results our algorithm has a higher performance in large scale grids.","","978-1-4577-0896-1","","10.1109/SNPD.2011.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063564","Adaptive;Grid Resource Discovery;Multi Resource Requests;Reinforcement Learning;peer to peer","Algorithm design and analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Load modeling;Peer to peer computing;Time factors","distributed processing;grid computing;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","adaptive peer-to-peer resource discovery;distributed computing;grid computing;large scale grids;load balancing;message passing;random walk resource discovery;reinforcement learning","","0","","11","","","6-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this very same line, this paper also addresses mechanisms that potentially can be used to meet a given quality of service or satisfy peak demands this service may have. These mechanisms imply the elastic growth of the grid infrastructure making use of cloud providers, regardless of whether they are commercial, like Amazon EC2 and GoGrid, or scientific, like Globus Nimbus.

However, cloud computing also presents many challenges, one of which is the difficulty in allowing users to freely obtain desired services, such as heterogeneous OSes and applications, via different light-weight devices. We have proposed a new paradigm by spatio-temporally extending the von Neumann architecture, called transparent computing, to centrally store and manage the commodity programs including OS codes, while streaming them to be run in non-state clients. This leads to a service-centric computing environment, in which users can select the desired services on demand, without concern for these services' administration, such as their installation, maintenance, management, and upgrade. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, namely Meta OS, to support such program streaming through a distributed 4VP<sup>+</sup> platform. Based on this platform, a pilot system has been implemented, which supports Windows and Linux environments. We verify the effectiveness of the platform through both real deployments and testbed experiments. The evaluation results suggest that the 4VP<sup>+</sup> platform is a feasible and promising solution for the future computing infrastructure for cloud services.","","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449403","Meta OS;cloud computing;cloud services;extended von Neumann architecture;transparent computing","Central Processing Unit;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Maintenance engineering;Transparent computing","","","","5","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Maintaining the paradigm of deterministic Boolean computing therefore becomes increasingly challenging. Stochastic computing (SC) processes digital data in the form of long pseudo-random bit-streams denoting probabilities and is therefore less vulnerable to uncertainty. When transient circuit variations are present, SC greatly outperforms classical binary implementations. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for binary systems to achieve arbitrarily low error rates, while SC can still trade-off precision for energy by using longer bit-streams. This makes the technique a valuable alternative to binary logic in emerging technologies with high inherent transient uncertainty. This paper assesses the feasibility of multi-stage SC and discusses energy and accuracy considerations in SC design. First, the basics of SC-circuit design are discussed. Second, we investigate three different sources of noise or uncertainty and assess their impact on SC accuracy. Third, we propose a methodological design strategy to evaluate the accuracy of general, multi-stage SC systems. The validity of this new approach is illustrated through the design of a 1D-DCT stochastic circuit, as part of a JPEG compression accelerator. Our analysis shows multi-stage stochastic computing requires very long word lengths to achieve high accuracy, resulting in low energy efficiency. Exploiting stochastic computing's transient error tolerance in emerging technologies will thus have a high energy cost.","2156-3357","","","10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2361070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924798","Accuracy;energy;modelling;multi-stage;stochastic computing (SC)","Accuracy;Energy efficiency;Integrated circuit modeling;Noise;Stochastic processes","discrete cosine transforms;electronic engineering computing;image coding;stochastic processes","1D-DCT stochastic circuit design;JPEG compression accelerator;binary logic;bit-streams;circuit behavior uncertainty;circuit behavior unreliability;deterministic Boolean computing;digital data processing;error rates;feature size scaling;integrated circuit technology;long-pseudorandom bit-streams;multistage SC circuit design;multistage stochastic computing;noise sources;probabilities;stochastic computing circuit accuracy;stochastic computing circuit energy-efficiency;transient circuit variations;transient error tolerance;transient uncertainty;uncertainty sources;uncertainty vulnerability","","0","","34","","2014-10-15","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such conventional model has demonstrated drawbacks and limitations primarily in preserving the stochastic and nondeterministic behaviors of biological processes by characterizing them as continuous and deterministic processes. Membrane computing has been considered as an alternative to address these limitations by providing modeling capabilities in representing the structure and processes of biological systems essential for biological applications. This study was carried out to investigate the modeling of hormone-induced calcium oscillations in liver cell with membrane computing. Simulation strategy of Gillespie algorithm and the method of model checking with Probabilistic Symbolic Model Checker were used to verify and validate the membrane computing model. The results produced by membrane computing model were compared with the results from ordinary differential equation model. The simulation and model checking of membrane computing model of the hormone-induced calcium oscillations showed that the fundamental properties of the biological process were preserved. Membrane computing model has provided a better approach in accommodating the structure and processes of hormone-induced calcium oscillations system by sustaining the basic properties of the system compared with ordinary differential equation model. However there were some other issues such as the selection of kinetic constants according to the behavior of biological processes has to be addressed to strengthen membrane computing capability in modeling biological processes.","","978-1-4577-1092-6","","10.1109/BIC-TA.2011.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046913","Gillespie algorithm;PRISM model checking;calcium oscillation;membrane computing","Biochemistry;Biological system modeling;Biomembranes;Calcium;Computational modeling;Erbium;Mathematical model","biocomputing;biological techniques;calcium;differential equations;formal verification;liver;stochastic processes","Gillespie algorithm;biological process modeling;biological system modelling;deterministic processes;hormone-induced calcium oscillation system;liver cell;membrane computing;nondeterministic behaviors;ordinary differential equation;probabilistic symbolic model checking;stochastic behaviors","","0","","13","","","27-29 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new multi-cores MCU architecture, named DFF (Data Flow driven on Function-level), which possesses the characteristics of function-level parallelism and data driven. It efficiently synthesizes the middle grain parallelism of data flow computing and the sequential computing commonly used in von Neumann structure. The main process of the design is explained by an example of data-driven computation implementing where the custom function stored in the single core (NIOSII), in the initialization phase, will begin to run only when all its operands are available, and the system will be in the sleep state when no effective data can be used to drive and the power will be saved significantly. Moreover, the multi-cores can carry out parallel operation under the data-independent.

Data stream applications must have low latency even when the incoming data rate fluctuates wildly. This is almost impossible with a local stream computing environment because its computational resources are finite. To address this kind of problem, we have devised a method and an architecture that transfers data stream processing to a Cloud environment as required in response to the changes of the data rate in the input data stream. Since a trade-off exists between application's latency and the economic costs when using the Cloud environment, we treat it as an optimization problem that minimizes the economic cost of using the Cloud. We implemented a prototype system using Amazon EC2 and an IBM System S stream computing system to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experimental results show that our approach reduces the costs by 80% while keeping the application's response latency low.","2159-6182","978-1-4577-0836-7","978-0-7695-4460-1","10.1109/CLOUD.2011.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008710","Amazon EC2;Cloud;DSMS;DSPS;Data Stream Processing;Dynamic Load Balancing;SPADE;System S","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Economics;Optimization;Pricing;Real time systems;Sensors","cloud computing;data handling","Amazon EC2 stream computing system;IBM System S stream computing system;application latency;cloud environment;computational resources;data stream processing;economic costs minimization;elastic stream computing;local stream computing environment;optimization problem","","8","","22","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, there are restrictions such as storage or power consumption. The use of reconfigurable logic allows to design low power yet potent architectures. Storage restrictions of small devices can be solved by using external servers to store and manage data. We have developed and tested a novel versatile digital architecture (VDA) to design inexpensive, but very flexible devices for mobile ubiquitous computing. A single VDA compliant device can be used as a mobile phone, video player, database, etc. In contrast to state of the art architectures, our approach offers new key facilities such as application download on demand and on-the-fly update of hardware acceleration components. These updates can be controlled by an external server or by the client itself. Furthermore we are able to monitor any internal signal of hardware components remotely for error detection and performance optimization.

With increasing number of users, Job scheduling becomes a strenuous task. Ordering the jobs by scheduler while maintaining the balance between quality of services (QoS), efficiency and fairness of jobs is quite challenging. Scheduling algorithms are implemented considering parameters such as throughput, resource utilization, latency, cost, priority, computational time, physical distances, performance, bandwidth, resource availability.

It provides a pool of shared resources to the users available on the basis of pay as you go service, means users pay only for those services which are used by him according to their access times. The data processing and storage amount is increasing quickly day by day in cloud environment. This leads to an uneven distribution of overall work on cloud resources. So a proper balance of overall load over the available resources is a major issue in cloud computing paradigm. Load balancing ensures that no single node will be overloaded and used to distribute workload among multiple nodes. It helps to improve system performance and proper utilization of resources. It also minimizes the time and cost involved in such big computing models. Load balancing and better resource utilization is provided by many existing algorithms.

Thus a big challenge has emerged to design applications on the heterogeneous devices and operating systems (OSes). This paper proposes a completely cross platform mobile transparent computing (CPMTC) method to make it possible for mobile devices to support various operating systems and application programs from underlying platform to application perspective based on the concept of transparent computing on PC. On the underlying platform of mobile device, a mobile pre-boot firmware (MPBF) is designed to initialize the mobile device and stream the OS image data to device through network. Within the firmware program, multiple OSes image data are able to be loaded on demand at runtime. In order to provide the cross platform support on the application layer, we develop an application design method based on HTML5 using the transparent server to manage the application and user data, and apply it to the e-Learning system. We deploy the MPBF on the experimental tablet, and then load different OSes into the tablet using the MPBF. After that, we run and evaluate the e-learning system over every loaded OS. The practical experiment results confirm that the CPMTC can be taken as the effective method to decouple not only OSes from hardware but also application programs from OS in mobile devices.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832146","HTML5;cross-platform;mobile device;transparent computing","Computer architecture;Hardware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Operating systems;Servers","firmware;hypermedia markup languages;mobile computing;notebook computers;operating systems (computers);software portability","CPMTC method;HTML5;MPBF;OS image data;cross platform mobile transparent computing method;e-learning system;firmware program;hardware platforms;mobile device platform;mobile preboot firmware;operating systems;software platforms;transparent computing","","0","","14","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grid computing (or the use of a computational grid) is applying the resources of many computers in a network to a single problem at the same time - usually to solve a scientific or technical problem that requires a great number of computer processing cycles or access to large amounts of data. One of the main strategies of Grid computing is to use middleware to divide and apportion pieces of a program among several computers, sometimes up to many thousands. Grid computing involves computation in a distributed fashion, which may also involve the aggregation of large-scale cluster computing based systems. The size of a Grid may vary from small - confined to a network of computer workstations within a corporation, for example - to being large, public collaboration across many companies and networks. ""The notion of a confined grid may also be known as intra-nodes cooperation whilst the notion of a larger, wider grid may thus refer to inter-nodes cooperation"". Since the spectrum of grid computing is too much broad it is very much important to balance the load among the various nodes of the network. Various load balancing algorithms were developed assuming homogenous set of nodes linked with homogenous and fast networks. In this paper we studies the various load balancing strategies that control the load of the entire system.","","978-1-4244-8678-6","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941745","Dynamic Load Balancing;Static Load Balancing","Computational modeling;Computers;Grid computing;Load management;Load modeling;Processor scheduling;Program processors","grid computing;middleware;resource allocation","computational grid;computer processing cycle;computer resource;computer workstation;data access;grid computing;internode cooperation;intranode cooperation;large-scale cluster computing;load balancing;middleware","","1","","11","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile computing provides a new paradigm for organizing and implementing computation over the Internet. There are two computational phenomena that involve mobility: code mobility and computation mobility. The former happens when pieces of code (such as Applets) move between computing devices, while the later concerns computation carried out in computing device (such as laptops) which change locations. Mobile computing has posed serious challenges to the safety and security of Internet-based systems. Theories and techniques are needed to decide if code coming from outside can be trusted, or to determine if a computation movement is safe, and so on. This work first reviews some formal methods that have recently been proposed for such purposes. These methods are based on either theorem proving or model checking, and each emphasizes on certain aspects of trustworthy computing. Then it focuses on a model checking approach to mobile computing. Traditionally model checking is based on modal logics which are appropriate for describing the temporal behaviors of systems. Since in mobile computing processes may evolve not only in time but also in space, efforts have recently been made to extend these logics with spatial modalities (to describe location changes), and to design model checking algorithms for them. However, so far there still lacks a satisfactory approach to introducing recursion into such spatial logics, due to subtle interplay between recursion and first-order quantification. We take the challenging task to extend a spatial ambient logic with fixpoints, yielding a predicate-based mu-calculus in which fixpoint formulas are formed using predicate variables. We also develop an algorithm for model checking finite-control mobile ambients against formulas of the logic, providing the first decidability result for an ambient logic with recursion.","0730-3157","0-7695-2209-2","","10.1109/CMPSAC.2004.1342885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342885","","Algorithm design and analysis;Calculus;Internet;Logic design;Mobile computing;Portable computers;Safety;Security","Internet;formal specification;mobile computing","Applets;Internet;Internet-based systems;code mobility;computation mobility;formal methods;modal logics;model checking;spatial ambient logic;trustworthy mobile computing","","0","","","","","28-30 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a main issue for cloud computing is to build a new layer to support a negotiation phase between service providers and consumers to establish SLAs between them.

First, this paper presents cloud resource allocation guidelines in the case where there is a limit to electric power capacity available in each area, assuming a cloud computing environment in which both processing ability and network bandwidth are allocated simultaneously. Next, it proposes a method for optimally allocating both processing ability and bandwidth as well as electric power capacity. Optimal allocation means that the number of requests that can be processed is maximized, and the power consumed by a request is minimized.

They must deal with their primary application goal as well as network related issues, such as quality of service demands, varying network density or energy conservation requirements. To simplify system development, traditional communication software design separates these concerns into several layers. When dealing with small, energy and computational constrained devices, this layered approach hides valuable information which can be used to adapt to the changing requirements of embedded and ubiquitous computing applications. By exposing cross-layer information and enabling interaction between the layers, cross-layer design can offer substantial benefits to the application. In this paper, we propose a method for coupling multiple simulators and emulators to allow easy development and testing of solutions which span multiple layers, enabling application and communication software to be designed and tested in a realistic unified environment. To illustrate our approach to cross-layer application development, we present an application example which utilize cross-layer communication to adapt to its current surrounding.","","0-7695-2512-1","","10.1109/ICESS.2005.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609901","","Application software;Computational modeling;Emulation;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Quality of service;Software design;Software testing;Ubiquitous computing;Wireless communication","digital simulation;embedded systems;mobile computing;object-oriented programming;telecommunication computing","communication software design;coupled simulation/emulation;cross-layer application development;cross-layer design;cross-layer enabled mobile wireless computing;cross-layer information;embedded computing application;energy conservation requirements;mobile nodes;quality of service;ubiquitous computing application;varying network density;wireless communication","","4","1","22","","","16-18 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many projects have successfully leveraged voluntary computing infrastructures by developing and distributing ""@home"" applications using the BOINC framework. Through generous contributions from the general public, these systems now have a computing backbone on which to have their data processed or simulations run. A shortcoming of such systems is that most users are often limited to contributing resources and few users are capable of developing or porting their own applications in order to use these resources. While many users are satisfied with receiving points (an intangible good) in return for their contribution, the need to port applications presents a barrier to entry to many other users who can potentially benefit from using the voluntary resources. In this paper, we describe enhancements made to the ""grid appliance"", a virtual machine based system which enables an execution environment in which users are given the opportunity to voluntarily share (providing and using) resources and run unmodified x86/Linux applications. Voluntary grids introduce a host of issues to tackle, most importantly getting users involved quickly. With that in mind, the grid appliance provides many tools for making a user-friendly environment for users, developers, and administrators.

Broker based Resource Management (BRM) have a lot of intelligent techniques like Request Deployment, Job Handle, Grid Resource Discovery, Match making, Optimization, Job Migration, Job scheduling, Middleware supports, Meta brokers, Resource brokers, Dispatcher. In BRM, Broker keeps track of information about all the Resource in its resource pool, including their availability, load, network accessibility, usage models, capabilities, and pricing information and the range of computational tasks that they can perform. The resource broker provides pairing services between the service requester (Buyer) and the service provider (supplier). The resource broker selects the best scheduler for the resource execution job, and collaborates with the scheduler to execute the multi tasks. Agents are only responsible for the timely and accurate processing of forms.

How to make appropriatedecisions when allocating resources to the tasks and dispatchingthe computing tasks to resource pool has become the main issuein cloud computing. The amount of allocated resources affects theexecution time of the applications and the cost incurred by the user. In fact, resource under-provisioning will necessarily affectthe performance. In contrast, over-provisioning can result in idleinstances and cause additional costs. Then, efficient scheduling algorithms are required for selection of best suitable resources for task execution. This paper focuses on some of the important workflow scheduling strategies. It brings out an exhaustive survey of such strategies in cloud computing and includes a detailed classification of them.

The grid, a distributed computing paradigm, seeks to exploit the synergies of technology and social collaboration to solve data or computation-intensive problems. The risk to a user's data and results is dramatically increased when using workflows, because the entire dataset is exposed to the grid. The use of reputation and provenance information has been proposed to avoid selecting 'untrusted' nodes when provisioning grid jobs. However, this information may be unreliable or open to manipulation. We propose a scheme that uses trusted platforms that are compliant with the trusted computing group specifications. We make use of integrity measurement, sealing and platform attestation to provide the following security services to grid workflows: trusted resource provider selection, confidentiality of job information, integrity of job information, and audit data for process provenance.","","978-0-7695-3156-4","978-0-7695-3156-4","10.1109/CCGRID.2008.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534287","Attestation;Grid;Sealing;Trusted Computing;Workflow","Collaborative work;Councils;Data security;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Information security;International collaboration;Laboratories;Military computing;Protection","data integrity;formal specification;formal verification;grid computing;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","data integrity;data security;distributed computing;formal specification;grid workflow;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;resource broker verification service;trusted computing","","0","","3","","","19-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the cloud systems, the main goal of the task scheduling algorithms is to balance the workload among the computing nodes and maximize the utilization while meeting the bound of the total execution time. Concerning the delay of the associated tasks scheduling in cloud computing, a hierarchical task model was discussed and the associated task scheduling algorithm based on delay-bound constraint (ATS-DB) was proposed. The associated tasks and the task execution order were represented by one directed acyclic graph (DAG). The proposed hierarchical task model can improve the task execution concurrency. The independent tasks in each layer was grouped into the corresponding task set belonging to the task layer. Through the calculation of the total tasks execution time bound in each task layer, the associated task was dispatched to the resources with the minimum execution time. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed ATS-DB algorithm can achieve better performance than HEFT algorithm in the terms of the total execution time and resource utilization.","","978-1-4799-4170-4","","10.1109/DCABES.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999064","Cloud computing;associated task scheduling;delay-bound constraint;hierarchical task model","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Delays;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","cloud computing;directed graphs;resource allocation","DAG;associate task scheduling algorithm;associated task scheduling algorithm;cloud computing environments;cloud systems;computing nodes;delay-bound constraint;directed acyclic graph;hierarchical task model;resource utilization;task execution concurrency;tasks scheduling;workload balancing","","0","","11","","","24-27 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main aim of this paper is to propose a strategic plan for the enhancement of computing degree programs in Iraqi universities and higher institutions. The paper begins by providing an overview of computing curriculum development. Then, computing education programs in Iraq are presented from a historic standpoint. The current situation in Iraq for computing education programs is also described in the paper. This current status provides the basis for the description of the proposed strategic plan.","","978-1-61284-642-2","","10.1109/EDUCON.2011.5773120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5773120","Iraq;computing degree programs;curricula;education programs;strategic plan","Computers;Cultural differences;Educational institutions;Engineering education;Materials;Proposals","computer science education;educational institutions;further education;strategic planning","Iraq;computing curriculum development;computing education program;higher education computing degree program;strategic plan;university","","0","","13","","","4-6 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, codes need be modified when constraints on system behavior have changed. Based on their production, this paper presents one type of rule, expresses fuzzy fact using operator predicate logic and presents a developing approach based on this type of rule. Therefore, the context-aware pervasive computing system developed using this approach need not modify codes when constraints on system behavior have changed. Such system can be more adaptive to dynamic changes and proactively provide information. In addition, requirements of context-aware pervasive computing application system can be expressed more accurately.

Our goal is to mine human activities and routines from this socio-geographic data in order to catch user's behaviour. To this aim, we introduce a methodology for trajectory pattern mining consisting in (a) finding frequent regions, more densely passed through ones, and (b) extracting trajectory patterns from those regions.

Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) allows multiple parties to perform computation on their private data to evaluate some function of their common interest. In this paradigm the individual data should be kept secret from other parties and the result of the computation should be available to all the parties. This subject of information security has created enormous interest among researchers. Many SMC models were devised and analyzed. The subject is becoming more relevant in this scenario of huge online transactions on the Internet. Many solutions, from earlier Millionaires Problem to recent Anonymity based computation on encrypted data are available in the literature. Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift from the distributed computing where an organization uses resources as service. This is a sort of ""utility computing"" where you pay-as-you-go like electricity bill. Cloud providers are the companies which manage large datacenters and have expertise of operating these datacenters. Cloud users are the organizations which use services from providers. Cloud users need not to deploy computing resources at their site. These resources are available from the cloud providers on utility basis and charged on usage basis. Thus an organization can improve efficiency while minimizing the expenditure and the operation overhead. They can focus on their core competencies. In this paradigm users send their data to the provider for computation and the result is provided by the provider. Many companies like Amazon, Google, IBM etc. are already in the market working as the cloud provider. As the services are gaining more popularity, concerns regarding the privacy of these data are also arising. They users of the cloud are worrying about the privacy of their data that has been supplied to the cloud provider. The solutions to these problems can be provided by the protocols of the SMC. In this tutorial, we propose SMC solution techniques that can be embedded while - esigning architecture of cloud computing especially when multiple cloud providers or multiple cloud users jointly compute some function of their private data inputs. Each of the users or providers of the cloud is worried about the privacy of the individual data but due to the mutual interest all of them want to know the value of the common function. With our experience of developing protocols and devising algorithms for various SMC problems we anticipate a crucial role of SMC in cloud computing. For example consider a case where multiple cloud users jointly work on a project and utilize the services of the same cloud provider. All of them want to simultaneously evaluate their equations without revealing individual equations to one another. In such scenarios the SMC solutions can be highly useful to provide privacy. In this tutorial, we explore such scenarios while discussing various protocols of SMC and their applicability in cloud computing.","","978-1-4244-8652-6","","10.1109/CIMSiM.2010.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701921","","","cloud computing;security of data","Internet;anonymity based computation;cloud computing;information security;millionaires problem;secure multiparty computation;utility computing","","0","","","","","28-30 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental features that are used in this computing model are a membrane structure where objects evolve discretely according to specified evolution rules. The evolution rules are applied in a non-deterministic and maximally parallel way, which means all the objects that can evolve, must evolve. Implementing a membrane system on an existing electronic computer cannot be a real implementation, it is merely a simulation. Metabolic and Gillespie algorithms have been used as simulation strategies for membrane computing models. Both algorithms implement discrete evolution approach but Metabolic algorithm is deterministic and Gillespie algorithm is stochastic in its evolution procedures. The Lotka-Volterra population is frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two objects interact, one is a predator and another is its prey. The objects, reactions and parameters extracted from the system of Ordinary Differential Equation of Lotka-Volterra population are used in defining membrane computing model. This paper compares the two simulation strategies by using membrane computing model of Lotka Voltera Population. The experiments show that number of objects, initial multisets, rules, volume of the system, reactivity rates, and numbers of simulation steps are essential elements in differentiating the simulation strategies. These elements are also being characterized according to the features offered by the simulation strategies. The results show that membrane computing simulation strategy of Gillespie Algorithm is an approach to preserve the stochastic behaviours of biological systems that absent in the deterministic approach of Metabolic Algorithm.","2155-6822","978-1-4577-0753-7","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021840","Gillespie algorithm;Lotka Voltera Population;Metabolic algorithm;membrane computing","Biological system modeling;Biomembranes;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Kinetic theory;Mathematical model;Oscillators","Monte Carlo methods;biocomputing;differential equations;predator-prey systems;stochastic processes","Gillespie algorithm;Lotka-Voltera population;biological system dynamics;deterministic evolution procesure;discrete evolution approach;evolution rule;membrane computing simulation;metabolic algorithm;molecular computing;ordinary differential equation;stochastic evolution procesure","","0","","11","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Time redundancy implies a re-execution of the failed computation after the failure has been detected, although this can further be optimized by the use of checkpoints these solutions still impose a significant delay. In many mission critical systems hardware redundancy has traditionally deployed in the form of process replication to provide fault tolerance, avoiding delay and maintaining tight deadlines. Both approaches have drawbacks, re-execution requiring additional time and replication requiring additional resources, especially energy. This forces the systems engineer to choose between time or hardware redundancy, cloud computing environments have largely chosen replication because response time is often critical. In this paper we propose a new computational model called shadow computing, which provides goal-based adaptive resilience through the use of dynamic execution. Using this general model we develop shadow replication which enables a parameterized tradeoff between time and hardware redundancy to provide fault tolerance. Then we build an analytical model to predict the expected energy savings and provide an analysis using that model.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785308","fault tolerance;resiliency;scheduling;shadow computing","Computational modeling","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;redundancy","cloud computing environments;dynamic execution;energy-aware fault tolerant computing;expected energy savings;failure detection;goal-based adaptive resilience;hardware redundancy;mission critical systems;parameterized tradeoff;process replication;shadow computing;shadow replication;systems engineer;time redundancy","","0","","8","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It involves large amounts of data and computing which require secure and reliable resource sharing across organisational domains. Despite its high computing performance orientation, communication delays between grid computing nodes is a big hurdle due to geographical separation in a realistic grid computing environment. Communication schemes such as broadcasting, multicasting and routing should, therefore, take communication delay into consideration. Such communication schemes in a grid computing environment pose a great challenge due to the arbitrary nature of its topology. In this context, a heuristic algorithm for multicast communication is proposed for grid computing networks with finite capacity and bursty background traffic. The scheme facilitates inter-node communication for grid computing networks and it is applicable to a single-port mode of message passing communication. The scheme utilises a queue-by-queue decomposition algorithm for arbitrary open queueing network models, based on the principle of maximum entropy, in conjunction with an information theoretic decomposition criterion and graph theoretic concepts. Evidence based on empirical studies indicates the suitability of the scheme for achieving an optimal multicast communication cost, subject to system decomposition constraints.","1462-5970","","","10.1049/ip-sen:20030810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240224","","","Internet;graph theory;message passing;multicast communication;performance evaluation;telecommunication traffic","broadcasting;bursty background traffic;communication delay;communication delays;databases;graph theory;grid computing networks;heuristic algorithm;high computing performance;high end computers;information theoretic decomposition criterion;maximum entropy;message passing;multicast communication;multicasting;queue-by-queue decomposition algorithm;resource sharing;routing;scientific instruments;system decomposition constraints;topology","","3","","","","","26 Aug. 2003","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

However, the HA system may work on incorrect status when a fault exists in heartbeat links in the HA architecture. This paper presents a HA system with an independent monitor-based mechanism which monitors the leader nodes and manage the system to avoid the fault operation resulting from failures of heartbeat links. Its architecture is discussed, and the dependability of the system is analyzed by a continuous time Markov chain model; the dependability of a HA system and the HA system with an independent monitor module are compared.

Despite such promises, cloud computing has not been adopted at a pace that was expected. Among various reasons that prevent its widespread adoption, the most serious issue that Cloud Computing faces concerns its inability to insure data privacy and confidentiality. The fact that the security challenges faced by the Cloud depend on its deployment model as well as delivery model has further aggravated this problem. Hence we need to develop unique solutions to address security risks at various levels in Cloud Computing.

Although not within the scope of these reports, there is also a need for students in computing related general education courses to be aware of the role that parallel and distributed computing technologies play in the computing landscape. One approach to integrating these topics into existing curricula is to spread them across several courses. However, this approach requires development of multiple instructional modules targeted to introduce PDC concepts at specific points in the curriculum. Such modules need to mesh with the goals of the courses for which they are designed in such a way that minimal material has to be removed from existing topics. At the same time the modules should provide students with an understanding of and experience employing fundamental PDC concepts.

The systems have to handle an amount of data eventually corresponding to 50 times the level of its predecessor experiment, Belle, by the end of 2022. The data size is comparable to the ones of LHC experiments. For the Belle II experiment we employed the distributed computing system based on DIRAC. DIRAC provides many features that we would have to develop and an interface with grid and cloud resources. Furthermore, we need a reliable and efficient metadata service that translates selection queries into a set of files. We design our metadata service based on AMGA. First, this year, the Belle II computing group realized a test bed based on DIRAC and entered a new phase of testing the feasibility of our system. Second, in order to identify the right files that should be used as input for a project, we set up an AMGA metadata server which allows getting a list of files, in the form of GUIDs. The metadata is extracted from the data files written to storage resources and used to fill the AMGA metadata catalog. Using the catalog a user query is translated into a file list and a list of sites retaining available data. This information is used to submit jobs that process the requested data. In conclusion, we have designed and constructed a Belle II distributed computing system and data handling system. It is essential for us to do practical tests for the operation of DIRAC, scalability of metadata service, scheme of job submission, and other involved components. The status of the Belle II computing system and Monte Carlo production campaign are presented.","","978-1-4799-0533-1","","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829577","AMGA;B factory;Belle II;CVMFS;DIRAC;HEP;KEK;data handling;distributed computing;grid;large scale data;metadata","Collaboration;Data handling;Physics;Production;Servers;Software","Monte Carlo methods;cloud computing;data handling;grid computing;high energy physics instrumentation computing","AMGA metadata server;Belle II experiment;GUID;LHC experiment;Monte Carlo production campaign;cloud resources;data handling system;distributed computing system;grid resources;metadata service;next-generation B factory experiment","","0","","22","","","Oct. 27 2013-Nov. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, if DVRs are extended to the cloud-based infrastructure, conversion of content and sharing it among multiple devices can be made possible through the cloud's computing power. To provide secure cloud computing service, appropriate measures are necessary to protect the computing processes performed on the content from inside and outside attackers. A content encryption scheme is a simple and effective way to protect content from attackers; however, if an encryption scheme is used, the user cannot use computing resources that can be used for media computation. This paper proposes a secure cloud DVR framework based on personal virtualization to securely provide various functions through cloud resources. The proposed scheme uses an input/output management unit (IOMMU), which serves as direct memory access (DMA) remapping for constructing secure personal virtualization. Using IOMMU, it is difficult for inside attackers to know which memory area is the actual memory of the target user. Therefore, secure computation in the cloud computing is possible through IOMMU. The proposed scheme uses an IOMMU based cloud computing to hide media computation from inside attacker, and a public cloud to increase efficiency.","0098-3063","","","10.1109/TCE.2014.6937320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6937320","Cloud-DVR (C-DVR);Digital Video Recorder (DVR);Network-DVR (N-DVR);Security Framework","Authentication;Cloud computing;Encryption;Media;Virtualization","cloud computing;cryptography;video recording","IOMMU based cloud computing;SC-DVR;cloud-based infrastructure;content encryption scheme;digital video recorder;direct memory access;input-output management unit;personal virtualization;public cloud;secure cloud DVR service;secure cloud computing service","","0","","","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this talk I survey recent research in developing software architectures to support these new capabilities. Key features of these architectures are the ability to interface with legacy applications, but still add considerable support for user tasks; the ability to incorporate machine learning so that the system adapts to the user over time; and the ability to cope with resource variability and user mobility.

The development of new low-thrust mission concepts requires efficient methods to rapidly determine feasibility and thoroughly explore trade spaces. This paper presents parallel, evolutionary computing methods to assess a trade-off between delivered payload mass and required flight time. The developed methods utilize a distributed computing environment in order to speed up computation, and use evolutionary algorithms to approximate optimal solutions. The methods are coupled with the Primer Vector theory, where a thrust control problem is transformed into a co-state control problem and the initial values of the co-state vector are optimized. The developed methods are applied to two mission scenarios: i) an orbit transfer around Earth and ii) a transfer between two distant retrograde orbits around Europa. The solutions found with the present methods are comparable to those obtained by other state-of-the-art trajectory optimizers. The required computational time can be up to several orders of magnitude shorter than that of other optimizers thanks to the utilization of the distributed computing environment, the significant reduction of the search space dimension with the primer vector theory, and the efficient and synergistic exploration of the remaining search space with evolutionary computing","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1656038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656038","","Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Earth;Evolutionary computation;Navigation;Optimization methods;Payloads;Propulsion;Space exploration;Space missions","aerospace computing;aerospace control;aerospace propulsion;evolutionary computation;ion engines;navigation;parallel processing;position control;space research","Primer Vector theory;costate control problem;costate vector optimization;deep space;distributed computing;evolutionary computing;flight time;fuel-efficient navigation;ion propulsion;low-thrust mission;orbit transfer;parallel computing;payload mass;search space dimension reduction;thrust control;trajectory optimization","","0","","27","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with grid computing, the focus of resource management problem is transformed to resource virtualization and allocation rather than job decomposition and scheduling. It is more urgent to find better solutions for cloud resource allocation than ever before. Although there have been some research efforts in grid computing, most of them aim at maximizing utility of system and lack of analysis for competition between different users. Some researches consider competition analysis, but they assume that common knowledge is certain and known for every user, which is difficult to be applied in a global distributed cloud environment. In this paper, we hereby propose a new resource pricing and allocation policy where users can predict the future resource price as well as satisfy budget and deadline constraints. Experimental results prove that resource price can gradually converge to an equilibrium state by dynamic games and that cloud users can receive Nash equilibrium allocation proportion without other competitors' bidding information.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578214","Nash equilibrium;cloud computing;dynamic games;resource allocation;resource pricing","Cloud computing;Clouds;Equations;Games;Mathematical model;Pricing;Resource management","Internet;game theory;grid computing;resource allocation;scheduling","Nash equilibrium allocation proportion;cloud computing;competition analysis;computing paradigm;equilibrium allocation policy;global distributed cloud environment;grid computing;job decomposition;job scheduling;resource allocation policy;resource management problem;resource pricing;resource virtualization","","15","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, previous researches mainly focused on deploying a service adaption module on mobile terminals or local central server to support the adaptive execution of mobile services, which brings huge overhead to mobile terminals or can hardly meet user's personalized requirements. Therefore, we propose a cloud based framework, called CAMSPF, which includes three parts: RMC (resource management cloud), AMSPC (adaptive mobile service provision cloud), and MSM (mobile service middleware). The CAMSPF deploys the service resources in RMC for realizing efficient resource management and provision, and constructs a PMSAA (private mobile service adaption agent) for each mobile user in AMSPC in order to efficiently support personalized adaptive execution of mobile service. In addition, the MCM is a lightweight software installed on mobile terminals by which CAMSPF can collect user's realtime context and monitor service request from mobile user. Our prototype implementation of CAMSPF verifies that the adaptive execution of mobile services can be performed more efficiently than other traditional approaches, with lower energy consumption on mobile terminals.","","978-1-4673-2479-3","","10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583634","cloud computing;mobile service adaption;pervasive computing;resource management and provision","Cloud computing;Context;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Resource management;Semantics","cloud computing;data privacy;middleware;mobile computing;power aware computing;resource allocation","AMSPC;CAMSPF;MSM;PMSAA;RMC;adaptive mobile service provision cloud;cloud-assisted mobile service provision framework;energy consumption;local central server;mobile service middleware;mobile terminals;mobility feature;personalized user demands;pervasive computing environment;private mobile service adaption agent;resource management cloud;service adaption module","","0","","8","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware.

The enormous growth in the use of mobile and embedded devices in ubiquitous computing environment and their interaction with human beings produces a huge amount of data that need to be processed efficiently anytime anywhere. However, such devices often have limited resources in terms of CPU, storage, battery power, and communication bandwidth. Thus, there is a need to transfer ubiquitous computing application services to more powerful computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the use of the grid as a candidate for provisioning computational services to applications in ubiquitous computing environments. In particular, we present a competitive model that describes the possible interaction between the competing resources in the grid infrastructure as service providers and ubiquitous applications as subscribers. The competition takes place in terms of quality of service (QoS) and cost offered by different grid service providers (GSPs). We also investigate the job allocation of different GSPs by exploiting the noncooperativeness among the strategies. We present the equilibrium behavior of our model facing global competition under stochastic demand and estimate guaranteed QoS assurance level by efficiently satisfying the requirement of ubiquitous application. We have also performed extensive experiments over distributed parallel computing cluster (DPCC) and studied overall job execution performance of different GSPs under a wide range of QoS parameters using different strategies.

In general, a VI submitted by a user to the FCS provider is unmapped at the time of the submission in that the user does not specify which computing clusters to use. The primary challenge to the FCS provider in supporting these novel applications is to establish a VI optimally over the substrate network such as a WDM network connecting many computing clusters. In this paper, we study the optimization problems of jointly allocating computing and wavelength resources for establishing Vis. First, we devise a branch and bound algorithm based on the decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation techniques to obtain the exact optimal solution with the objective being the minimization of the resource leasing cost of a VI. Second, we propose efficient heuristics to deal with a large number of online requests for Vis and compare their performance with the optimal solution.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062206","","Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Cost function;Distributed computing;Joining processes;Lagrangian functions;Minimization methods;Resource management;WDM networks","minimisation;relaxation theory;resource allocation;tree searching;wavelength division multiplexing;workstation clusters","Lagrangian relaxation technique;WDM networks;agile platform;application-specific platform;branch and bound algorithm;decomposition technique;distributed computing application;federated computing services;geographically distributed computing clusters;heuristics;joint allocation;optimization problems;private platform;resource leasing cost minimization;virtual infrastructures","","4","","13","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the inherent risks can be managed, in the near term significant investment in skills, processes, tools and technology is a prerequisite for doing so efficiently. For many organisations that use ICT services, the level of investment needed will often be prohibitive. This has created the opportunity for the emergence of trusted cloud brokerage services that can invest strategically to assist organisations with the use of Cloud Computing services and management of the associated risks, developing service portfolios that reduce upfront costs, so that use of Cloud Computing services becomes the best choice on a project by project basis.

Therefore, dynamic execution properties of volunteer node should be considered in scheduling schemes, in order to design a stable and reliable volunteer computing system.

In order to utilize the power of cloud computing completely, we need an efficient task scheduling algorithm. The traditional Min-Min algorithm is a simple, efficient algorithm that produces a better schedule that minimizes the total completion time of tasks than other algorithms in the literature [7]. However the biggest drawback of it is load imbalanced, which is one of the central issues for cloud providers. In this paper, an improved load balanced algorithm is introduced on the ground of Min-Min algorithm in order to reduce the makespan and increase the resource utilization (LBIMM). At the same time, Cloud providers offer computer resources to users on a pay-per-use base. In order to accommodate the demands of different users, they may offer different levels of quality for services. Then the cost per resource unit depends on the services selected by the user. In return, the user receives guarantees regarding the provided resources. To observe the promised guarantees, user-priority was considered in our proposed PA-LBIMM so that user's demand could be satisfied more completely. At last, the introduced algorithm is simulated using Matlab toolbox. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm can lead to significant performance gain and achieve over 20% improvement on both VIP user satisfaction and resource utilization ratio.","","978-1-4799-1589-7","","10.1109/ParCompTech.2013.6621389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621389","Cloud Computing;Cloud Task Scheduling;Load Balance;Makespan;Min-Min Algorithm;User-priority Aware","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Load management;Schedules;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","cloud computing;mathematics computing;quality of service;resource allocation;scheduling","Matlab toolbox;PA-LBIMM;VIP user satisfaction;cloud computing;computer resources;large-scale distributed computing;load balancing;quality for services;resource utilization ratio;task scheduling algorithm;user-priority guided min-min scheduling algorithm","","1","","15","","","21-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users expect to run computational intensive applications on Smart Mobile Devices (SMDs) in the same way as powerful stationary computers. However in spite of all the advancements in recent years, SMDs are still low potential computing devices, which are constrained by CPU potentials, memory capacity and battery life time. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the latest practical solution for alleviating this incapacitation by extending the services and resources of computational clouds to SMDs on demand basis. In MCC, application offloading is ascertained as a software level solution for augmenting application processing capabilities of SMDs. The current offloading algorithms offload computational intensive applications to remote servers by employing different cloud models. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the establishment of distributed application processing platform at runtime which requires additional computing resources on SMDs. This paper reviews existing Distributed Application Processing Frameworks (DAPFs) for SMDs in MCC domain. The objective is to highlight issues and challenges to existing DAPFs in developing, implementing, and executing computational intensive mobile applications within MCC domain. It proposes thematic taxonomy of current DAPFs, reviews current offloading frameworks by using thematic taxonomy and analyzes the implications and critical aspects of current offloading frameworks. Further, it investigates commonalities and deviations in such frameworks on the basis significant parameters such as offloading scope, migration granularity, partitioning approach, and migration pattern.

Parallel computing for high performance scientific applications gained widespread adoption and deployment about two decades ago. Computer systems based on shared memory and message passing parallel architectures were soon followed by clusters and loosely coupled workstations, that afforded flexibility and good performance for many applications at a fractional cost of MPP. Such platforms, referred to as parallel distributed computing systems, have evolved considerably and are currently manifested as very sophisticated metacomputing and Grid systems. This paper traces the evolution of loosely coupled systems and highlights specific functional, as well as fundamental, differences between clusters and NOW of yesteryear versus metacomputing Grids of today. In particular, semantic differences between Grids and systems such as PVM and MPICH are explored. In addition, the recent trend in Grid frameworks to move away from conventional parallel programming models to a more service-oriented architecture is discussed. Exemplified by toolkits that follow the OGSA specification, these efforts attempt to unify aspects of Web-service technologies, high performance computing, and distributed systems in order to enable large scale, cross-domain sharing of compute, data, and service resources. The paper also presents specific examples of current metacomputing and Grid systems with respect to the above characteristics, and discusses the relative merits of different approaches.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926-1","","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213452","","Application software;Concurrent computing;Costs;Distributed computing;High performance computing;Message passing;Metacomputing;Parallel architectures;Parallel processing;Workstations","Internet;message passing;natural sciences computing;parallel architectures;parallel programming;performance evaluation;shared memory systems;workstation clusters","MPICH;NOW;OGSA specification;PVM;Web-service technologies;clusters;cross-domain sharing;distributed computing;high performance computing;loosely coupled workstations;message passing;metacomputing;parallel architectures;parallel computing;parallel programming;scientific applications;semantic differences;service-oriented architecture;shared memory;toolkits","","0","","","","","22-26 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile Cloud Computing refers to an infrastructure where data processing and storage can happen away from mobile device. Portio research estimates that mobile subscribers worldwide will reach 6.9 billion by the end of 2013 and 8 billion by the end of 2016. Ericsson also forecasts that mobile subscriptions will reach 9 billion by 2017. Due to increasing use of mobile devices the requirement of cloud computing in mobile devices arise, which gave birth to Mobile Cloud Computing. Mobile devices do not need to have large storage capacity and powerful CPU speed. Due to storing data on cloud there is an issue of data security. Because of the risk associated with data storage many IT professionals are not showing their interest towards Mobile Cloud Computing. To ensure the correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose an effective mechanism with salient feature of data integrity and confidentiality. This paper proposed a mechanism which uses the concept of RSA algorithm, Hash function along with several cryptography tools to provide better security to the data stored on the mobile cloud.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781303","Cloud;confidentiality;data security;data storage;integrity;mobile cloud computing;mobile user","Atmospheric measurements;Encryption;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Terminology","cloud computing;data integrity;mobile computing;public key cryptography;storage management","RSA;cryptography tools;data confidentiality;data integrity;data processing;data security;hash function;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;secure data storage","","0","","23","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It offers a concentration of resources but also poses risks for data privacy. A single breach can cause significant loss. The heterogeneity of “users” represents a danger of multiple, collaborative threats. In cloud computing, entities may have multiple accounts associated with a single or multiple service providers (SPs). Sharing sensitive identity information (that is, Personally Identifiable information or PII) along with associated attributes of the same entity across services can lead to mapping of the identities to the entity, tantamount to privacy loss. Identity management (IDM) is one of the core components in cloud privacy and security and can help alleviate some of the problems associated with cloud computing. Available solutions use trusted third party (TTP) in identifying entities to SPs. The solution providers do not recommend the usage of their solutions on untrusted hosts. We propose an approach for IDM, which is independent of TTP and has the ability to use identity data on untrusted hosts. The approach is based on the use of predicates over encrypted data and multi-party computing for negotiating a use of a cloud service. It uses active bundle-which is a middleware agent that includes PII data, privacy policies, a virtual machine that enforces the policies, and has a set of protection mechanisms to protect itself. An active bundle interacts on behalf of a user to authenticate to cloud services using user's privacy policies.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-4250-8","","10.1109/SRDS.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623416","active bundle;cloud computing;computing predicates;identity management system;multi-party computing;privacy;security","Authentication;Cloud computing;Clouds;Cryptography;Data privacy;Privacy","Internet;cryptography;data privacy;middleware","IT services;Internet based services;business processes support;cloud computing;cloud security;data encryption;data privacy;identity information protection;identity management;middleware;multiparty computing;multiple service providers;personally identifiable information;sensitive identity information sharing;trusted third party","","7","","17","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By a simulation the interval-valued computing device can compute everything that the classical computing devices can compute using bits in a byte. Moreover, theoretically, this device is more effective than the traditional computers, because of the possibility of infinite parallelism. A method is presented to solve the Q-SAT problem in linear time using the interval-valued approach. Our device uses the usual concept of intervals to make the computations in a very effective way.

As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.","","978-1-4244-9276-3","","10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026885","TrustCloud framework;accountability;cloud computing;cloud computing security;data-centric logging;trust","Business;Cloud computing;Google;History;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data;system monitoring","IT systems;TrustCloud;cloud computing security;cloud computing trust;cloud security;computing services;data access;data accountability;data ownership;data retention;data transfer;data-centric logging-accountability;data-centric thinking;security of data;system-centric logging-accountability","","4","","13","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, constrained resources, especially CPU and battery hinder their successful adoption. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) aims to augment computational capabilities of resource-constraint mobile devices and conserve their native resources by remotely performing intensive tasks. In typical MCC solutions, intensive tasks are offloaded to distant VM-based cloud data centers or cloudlets whose exploitation originates long WAN latency and/or virtualization overhead degrading RiMA execution efficiency. In this paper, a lightweight Resource-oriented MCC (RMCC) architecture is proposed that exploits resources of plethora of Adjacent Service-based Mobile Cloudlets (ASMobiC) as fine-grained mobile service providers. In RMCC, ASMobiCs host prefabricated Restful services to be asynchronously called by mobile service consumers at runtime. RMCC is a Restful cross-platform architecture functional on major mobile OSs (e.g., Android and iOS) and realizes utilization of the computing resources of off-the-shelve outdated or damaged-yet-functioning mobile devices towards green MCC. Results of benchmarking advocate significant mean time- and energy-saving of 87% and 71.45%, respectively when intensive tasks are executed in ASMobiCs.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037763","Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation;Computing Offloading;Distributed and Parallel Mobile Computing;Mobile Cloud Computing","Cloud computing;Context;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Smart phones","cloud computing;mobile computing","ASMobiC;CPU;RMCC;RMCC architecture;RiMA;VM based cloud data centers;WAN latency;adjacent service based mobile cloudlets;fine grained mobile service providers;lightweight Resource-oriented MCC;mobile cloud computing framework;mobile devices;mobile service consumers;resource constraint mobile devices;resource intensive mobile applications;smartphones","","0","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security has remained a constant issue for Open Systems and internet, when we are talking about security, cloud really suffers. Lack of security is the only hurdle in wide adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing is surrounded by many security issues like securing data and examining the utilization of cloud by the cloud computing vendors. This paper proposes a scheme to securely store and access of data via internet. We have used ECC based PKI for certificate procedure because the use of ECC significantly reduces the computation cost, message size and transmission overhead over RSA based PKI as 160-bit key size in ECC provides comparable security with 1024-bit key in RSA. We have designed Secured Cloud Storage Framework (SCSF). In this framework, users not only can securely store and access data in cloud but also can share data with multiple users through the unsecure internet in a secured way.

However, unlike typical commercial applications that often just requires a moderate amount of ordinary resources, large-scale scientific applications often need to process enormous amount of data in the terabyte or even petabyte range and require special high performance hardware with low latency connections to complete computation in a reasonable amount of time. To address these challenges, we build an infrastructure that can dynamically select high performance computing hardware across institutions and dynamically adapt the computation to the selected resources to achieve high performance.

Thus the virtualization technique allows various systems to become a computing platform in virtualized computing environment. However, some virtualized systems create critical utilization by computation power during creation of virtual machine. In our research, we analyze creation characteristics of virtual machine on various dimensions like virtual machine, virtualized system, and storage server. To perform our study, we implement an automated measurement method and test bed which employs Xen as hypervisor on top of the cluster systems with storage server for distributing virtual disk images. Our experiments indicate that computational power of virtualized system affects the boot time of virtual machine in our test bed even the heterogeneity is relatively row. Also, the creation of virtual machine creates significant overhead (100%) at initial phase on virtualized system in worst case. Additionally, we provide overhead analysis on storage server through generating workloads by scaling virtual machines.","","978-1-4577-0185-6","978-89-88678-37-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967507","Cloud Computing;Performance Analysis;Virtual Machine;Virtualization;Virtualized Computing Environment","Hardware;Servers;Software;Time frequency analysis;Time measurement;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","automated measurement method;cloud computing;distributing virtual disk images;hardware level virtualization;power computation;scaling virtual machines;virtual machine creation characteristics;virtualization software stacks;virtualization technology;virtualized computing environment","","0","","25","","","21-23 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important property of a virtualized utility computing platform is how quickly it can react to changing demand. We refer to the capability of a utility computing platform to quickly reassign resources as the agility of the platform. We are targeting hosting utility provider environments where the entire platform is under the control of a single administrative domain and application instances often form application-level clusters. In this work, we examine resource reassignment mechanisms in these environments from the agility perspective and outline a new mechanism that exploits properties of a virtualized utility computing platform. This new mechanism employs ghost virtual machines (VMs), which participate in application clusters, but do not handle client requests until activated by the resource management system. We evaluate this, as well as other, mechanisms on a utility computing testbed. The results show that this ghost VM approach is superior to other approaches in its agility, and allows a new VM to be added to an existing application cluster in a few seconds with negligible overhead. This is a promising result as we develop resource management algorithms for a globally distributed utility computing platform.","","978-0-7695-2915-8","","10.1145/1408654.1408663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483376","agility;utility computing;virtualization","Computer applications;Mechanical factors;Physics computing;Platform virtualization;Resource management;Resource virtualization;Testing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","distributed processing;resource allocation;virtual machines","application level clusters;ghost virtual machines;resource management system;resource reassignment mechanisms;single administrative domain;virtualized utility computing","","4","","20","","","12-12 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A location-transparent scheduled grid demand specifies only an amount of computing resources needed in a specified time interval to process input data. The network node generating a demand is called a client node. There are several network nodes which have sufficient resources for a demand. These nodes are called resource nodes. An algorithm is used to choose a resource node to reserve a specified amount of computing resources and provision a lightpath between the resource node and the client node. Given a set of location-transparent scheduled grid demands, it is required to provision the best lightpath (i.e. wavelength resources) as well as computing resources available during the specified time interval for each demand so as to optimize a certain objective function. In our work, we develop integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for 2 objective functions: 1) Given a network capacity, maximize the number of demands accepted; 2) Minimize the total number of wavelength-links to honor a given set of demands. Because the ILP algorithms are computationally expensive, we also develop heuristics to deal with large networks. The simulation results show that our heuristics achieve good performance.","","978-3-901882-27-2","978-3-901882-26-5","10.1109/ONDM.2008.4578408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578408","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Optical computing;Optical fiber networks;Optical wavelength conversion;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Switching circuits","grid computing;integer programming;linear programming;optical computing;optical fibre networks;scheduling","client node;computing resources;integer linear programming formulations;lightpath provision;location-transparent scheduled grid demands;network capacity;network node;optical grid networks;resource nodes","","1","","8","","","12-14 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among various properties the applications may specify, the concurrency property, i.e., property delineating concurrency among contextual activities, is of great importance. It is because the concurrency property is one of the most frequently specified properties by context-aware applications. Moreover, the concurrency property serves as the basis for specification of many other properties. Existing schemes implicitly assume that context collecting devices share the same notion of time. Thus, the concurrency property can be easily detected. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in pervasive computing environments, which are characterized by the asynchronous coordination among heterogeneous computing entities. To cope with this challenge, we identify and address three essential issues. First, we introduce logical time to model behavior of the asynchronous pervasive computing environment. Second, we propose the logic for specification of the concurrency property. Third, we propose the Concurrent contextual Activity Detection in Asynchronous environments (CADA) algorithm, which achieves runtime detection of the concurrency property. Performance analysis and experimental evaluation show that CADA effectively detects the concurrency property in asynchronous pervasive computing scenarios.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5887320","Concurrency property;asynchronous environment.;context-awareness","Algorithm design and analysis;Concurrent computing;Context;Lattices;Pervasive computing;Runtime;Semantics","concurrency control;formal specification;ubiquitous computing","CADA algorithm;asynchronous coordination;asynchronous pervasive computing environment;concurrency property;concurrent contextual activity detection;context-awareness;contextual properties;heterogeneous computing entities;logical time;runtime detection;specification","","4","","23","","2011-06-16","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, the possibility to provide high performance computing (HPC) as a service has been investigated in conjunction with the cloud computing paradigm. While this is a viable solution for applications that do not require HPC in the truest sense -- with supercomputers which offer paramount performance regarding computation, network interconnect and storage -- there are HPC applications which cannot be realized in this way. HPC as a service can be offered for these applications as well, but it requires a different approach than the usage of cloud computing. The enhancement of mostly best effort based HPC with long-term service level agreements (SLAs) is a potential solution. HPC providers then need not only to decide on which service levels to offer but need to closely investigate the framework conditions for these service levels. The scheduling of these service levels is a difficult task and we simulate a proposed algorithm for providing guarantees on waiting times and the implications on other jobs. We investigate the influence of setting a maximum allowed job size on prioritized jobs and conclude that it makes sense to restrict this size for both clients and provider.","","978-1-4673-3049-7","","10.1109/SCC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274193","Discrete event simulation;Distributed computing;Simulation","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Contracts;Load modeling;Quality of service;Scheduling;Silver","cloud computing;contracts;mainframes","HPC;SLA;cloud computing paradigm;computation;high performance computing;network interconnect;service level agreements;storage;supercomputers","","0","","14","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an improved time-based checkpointing protocol is proposed, which is suitable for mobile computing systems based on Mobile IP. The main improvement over a traditional time-based protocol is that our protocol reduces the number of checkpoints per checkpointing process to nearly minimum, so that fewer checkpoints need to be transmitted through the bandwidth-limited wireless links. The proposed protocol also performs very well in the aspects of minimizing the number and the size of messages transmitted in the wireless network. Therefore, the protocol brings very little overhead to a mobile host which has limited resource.

While this separation has advantages, it poses significant challenges when technical staff, and leadership wish to view, and evaluate historical, current, and future state of the fleet, rather than a single spacecraft. To overcome this disadvantage of this approach it was determined necessary to develop a secure rich web application, which integrates disparate data sets, into a unified situational awareness dashboard. To facilitate the rapid design, development, integration, testing, and deployment of this dashboard, an existing cloud computing platform was utilized. In addition, an open source operating system, computing languages, and version control system were used, to control cost. Five virtual machine instances were deployed on a government certified public cloud computing provider. One instance securely receives disparate data, from spacecraft operation centers, then extracts, transforms, normalizes, and loads them onto data stores. Other instances play the roles of an administrative server, an application server, and a web server that securely provides the data visually, and as a Restful web service API, only to specific IP addresses, and to authenticated and authorized users.","","","","10.1109/SMC-IT.2014.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979141","AWS;GSFC;Gov Cloud;NASA;RESTful web service API;SSMO;cloud computing;cloud services;dashboard;html 5;node.js;open source;situational awareness;timeline","Authentication;Cloud computing;Servers;Space missions;Space vehicles;Telemetry","Web services;aerospace computing;application program interfaces;authorisation;cloud computing;operating systems (computers);program testing;public domain software;space vehicles","IP addresses;RESTful Web service API;Web server;administrative server;authenticated users;authorized users;computing languages;government certified public cloud computing provider;integrated fleet-centric cloud computing based solution;mission-specific operations centers;open source operating system;secure rich Web application;spacecraft operation centers;unified situational awareness dashboard;version control system;virtual machine instances","","0","","2","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reconfigurable computing technology can make use of system resources sufficiently and exert the efficiency of the applications. Reconfigurable programming environment is the key to popularize reconfigurable computing technology. Software engineers can program FPGA by using reconfigurable programming language, and moreover, the reconfigurable compiler can provide an architecture-independent developing platform for high-level language programmers in order that they can use the reconfigurable computing system flexibly. Three typical reconfigurable computing systems are analyzed in this paper, including SGI RASC RC100, Cray XD1 and SRC-6E. Some typical reconfigurable programming environments are introduced, such as the Mitrion-C platform, the Impulse-C platform, etc. However, neither of them is convenient enough for software engineers to program FPGA. In this paper, a more useful reconfigurable programming language called RCC (Reconfigurable Computing C) is proposed. It is based on the subset of ANSI-C and extends some data types and functions. A RCC compiler is built to translate the RCC applications into VHDL description. Users can program FPGA easily by using the RCC language if they are familiar with ANSI-C. On FPGA simulator, we test 3 applications and get about 19X speedup. Furthermore, it is easier to use than some typical reconfigurable programming languages.","","978-1-4244-4600-1","978-0-7695-3738-2","10.1109/HPCC.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167065","","Application software;Application specific integrated circuits;Computational modeling;Computer languages;Field programmable gate arrays;High level languages;Program processors;Programming environments;Programming profession;Testing","field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;program compilers;programming languages;reconfigurable architectures","FPGA simulator;RCC compiler;RCC language;Reconfigurable Computing C;VHDL description;data types;field programmable gate arrays;reconfigurable computing;reconfigurable programming language","","1","","22","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ubiquitous computing environment supports a busy and mobile user's need of being able to work on his task anytime and anywhere he wants. Along with user's data (his profile, task, and application registry) the machine-acquired intelligence needs to be transported as well in order that the user could continue working on an intelligent environment. Machine intelligence is acquired through incremental learning. In a context-sensitive environment that has a rich selection of modalities and media for data input and output, an intelligent computing system could determine the I/O devices appropriate for the user's setting after considering the user's location, the noise level in the environment, and the presence or absence of other people in the vicinity. Every new setting (pre-condition scenario) produces a new I/O devices configuration (post-condition scenario) suited for the setting; each new scenario knowledge gets stored onto knowledge database.

In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trustworthiness, quantitative trustworthiness metrics, unified scale of trust factors, trust factors categorization, trust coordinate and multi-criteria analysis for trustworthiness decision making. Our comprehensive framework of trustworthiness evaluation contains five basic building blocks. The preprocessing block query and calculate the existent trustworthiness record. Then the trust factors are collected, if there was no match record found. The trust factor management block categorize the trust factors and convert them by using unified scale. The trust factor processing block is for weighting and positioning of trust factors. The trustworthiness decision making block provide calculation of cloud service trustworthiness, and the results are recorded in our trustworthiness record block. The proposed trustworthiness measurement framework is employed in several experiments by using existing trust dataset.

Hence, these deception schemes are not very suitable for the practical applications.

Designing platforms for specific applications using the reconfigurable logic such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or highly parallel processors such as Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) will dramatically increase power efficiency. This is the concept of domain specific computing. Combining the advantages of different platforms to build a heterogeneous computing platform is the trend of domain specific computing. On the other hand, the research on brain networks plays a vital role in understanding the connectivity patterns of the human brain and disease-related alterations. Recent studies have suggested a noninvasive way of modeling and analyzing the human cortical networks with MRI by graph theory based approaches. However, both the construction and analysis of brain networks require tremendous computation. Currently, only hundreds of nodes can be analyzed due to lack of computing power. By increasing the number of nodes, the resolution of cortical networks will be greatly enhanced, thus hopefully helps the early diagnosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. A well-designed computing platform is the key to this problem. In this work, we inject the power of heterogeneous hardware computing into the brain network research, to help the research on the connectivity patterns of both normal and diseased brains. Besides, one important outcome is an accelerated BLAS and Graph algorithms package, which will provide insights into domain specific computing to boarder audience in both biomedical and computer science domains.","","978-1-4244-7809-5","","10.1109/ASQED.2010.5548242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548242","","Alzheimer's disease;Application software;Biomedical computing;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Humans;Programmable logic arrays;Supercomputers","biomedical MRI;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;field programmable gate arrays;medical image processing","BLAS algorithms package;Graph algorithms package;brain disease diagnosis;brain network analysis;cortical networks;domain specific computing;field programmable gate arrays;graphic processing units;hardware computing;magnetic resonance imaging","","2","","28","","","3-4 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TRECC's work in virtualization is in step with one of the hottest trends in cluster computing. Virtualization works by effectively splitting one or more cluster nodes into a greater number of virtual nodes. To do this, the scheduler needs additional information that lets it decide whether a given job can even run effectively under a virtual environment.

The native support for concurrency makes Erlang an efficient language for multi-core and even many-core programming. The support for large number of light-weight processes in distributed computing environment makes Erlang a good choice for cloud computing. Building more cores on a single chip is a trend in processor design. Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor , which is equipped with at least 60 cores, is the first commercial many-core product released by Intel. Xeon Phi coprocessor is encapsulated in a PCIe card and communicates with host operating system through a specialized interface library called SCIF. This paper introduces the architecture of Xeon Phi coprocessor and analyses the internals of SCIF programming interface first. Then this paper proposes a solution that integrates the computing power of multi-core host machine and Xeon Phi many-core coprocessor transparently. The solutions implements a high efficient SCIF-based Erlang distribution carrier as a plugin into Erlang virtual machine, and extends Erlang VM itself to support remote port access in order to support process location policy defined in this solution. In the end, this paper shows a practical use case of the proposed solution in cloud service environment: improve web server capacity without modifying user program.

With the advancing of computing model, from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing, researchers have focused their attention from mobile learning (ML) to ubiquitous learning (UL) in today's e-learning. Through convenient and flexible ubiquitous devices and wired/wireless network, researchers and developers strive to provide learners with teaching and learning materials, services, together with collaborator that can be accessible anytime, anywhere, with appropriate interfaces. Traditional researches suppose to develop a generic system. They rarely take the handicapped into account. But in ubiquitous computing environment the handicapped should be offered the same services as others. This paper describes the design of a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) framework which takes care of requirements of the disabled. Because learners may have very different skills and profiles the system will find most relevant learning materials and best interface to deliver to them. The system will also find helpers around the learner and makes them communication with each other via feasible interfaces.","","978-1-4244-1685-1","978-1-4244-1686-8","10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4525491","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Education;Electronic learning;Engines;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing;Wireless networks","computer aided instruction;groupware;handicapped aids;ubiquitous computing","computer supported collaborative learning framework;desktop computing;e-learning;handicapped;mobile learning;ubiquitous computing environment;wired network;wireless network","","1","","15","","","6-8 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It shows how history can improve teaching of computing courses, particularly introductory courses. The approach uses computing history as a thread throughout a course by adapting relevant historical materials to enhance course delivery. The expectation is that computing history can make a positive change in a course from one of only factual content to one containing dynamic interludes involving people, places, and events. The result is that computing courses become more interesting and can stimulate more students, particularly non-specialists, to engage in computing as their major field of study.

The invisibility of embedded computing devices has made it easier to collect and use information about individuals without their knowledge. Sensitive and private information might be stored for long periods of time and appear anywhere at anytime. Thus, a cost, in the form of privacy, might need to be paid to benefit from ubicomp. In this paper, we introduce the concept of quality of privacy (QoP) which allows balancing the trade-off between the amount of privacy a user is willing to concede and the value of the services that can be provided by a ubicomp application, in a similar way as that of quality of service (QoS). We propose an agent-based architecture that adapts the behavior of the ubicomp application to the users' context, in order to satisfy the level of QoP, that both, the application and the user have agreed upon. To illustrate this architecture, we extend a handheld-based mobile hospital information system in order to preserve privacy in ubicomp hospitals environment.","1550-4069","0-7695-2454-0","","10.1109/ENC.2005.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592201","","Computer architecture;Costs;Embedded computing;Hospitals;Pervasive computing;Physics computing;Privacy;Quality of service;Space technology;Ubiquitous computing","data privacy;medical information systems;quality of service;ubiquitous computing","agent-based architecture;embedded computing device;handheld-based mobile hospital information system;pervasive computing;private information;quality of privacy;quality of service;ubicomp application;ubiquitous computing","","2","","14","","","26-30 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It incorporates data parallelism at the base level, so that programmers do not have to specify low-level sequential tasks such as sorting, looping and parallelization. Our paradigm supports all of the standard data-parallel and massively parallel computing algorithms. It combines numerical computation (such as convolution, matrix multiplication, and graphics) with nonnumerical computing (such as compilation, graph algorithms, rule-based systems, and language interpreters).

An auto-adaptive overlay is a fault tolerant one, creating a reliable system. When network resources are unreliable and sometime untrusted, trust management becomes an important issue for resource selection and allocation. This paper describes a new model for resource trust management in Mobile Cloud systems. It uses a bio-inspired structure for constructing the overlay in a honeycomb structure. Then we introduce a model for resource trust management based on feedback, which is very similar to peer-to-peer trust management systems like Eigen Trust, R2Trust, Super Trust or Trust Me. Based on overlay construction and trust value computation, we propose a general flow for a resource request in Mobile Cloud systems logically organized as a honeycomb structure. We evaluate the proposed solution using simulation and the obtained results highlights the performance of proposed auto-adaptive overlay that can be use as a content distribution platform in Mobile Cloud systems.","","978-1-4799-5918-1","","10.1109/ISPDC.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900215","Mobile Cloud Computing;Overlay Network;Peer-to-Peer Systems;Resource Management;Trust Management","Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Overlay networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing","cloud computing;computer network security;mobile computing;overlay networks;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;trusted computing","Eigen Trust;R2Trust;Super Trust;Trust Me;auto-adaptive overlay network;heterogeneous resource management;high-heterogeneous mobile devices;honeycomb structure;joining protocol;mobile cloud computing;mobile cloud systems;peer-to-peer trust management systems;resource allocation;resource selection;resource trust management;routing protocol","","0","","23","","","24-27 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when the data to be accessed remotely is somewhat sensitive, as implied by many applications of personal computing, users may prefer to warehouse the data in their residences rather than in some public places. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed to realize personal computing ubiquitously by satisfying such demand. The proposed scheme employs home-automation techniques to grant properly authenticated users remote access to the data stored somewhere off the infrastructure (e.g., their personal workstations) while avoiding the expense of deploying high-availability servers at home. It also provides three kinds of authentication mechanisms and hence allows users to choose among different levels of the tradeoff between security and ubiquity, providing a complete solution for ubiquitous personal computing.","1810-7869","0-7803-8193-9","","10.1109/ICNSC.2004.1297087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297087","","Authentication;Automatic control;Energy management;GSM;Home automation;Home computing;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing;Web services;Workstations","home automation;home computing;network servers;security of data;ubiquitous computing","always-on-line servers;authentication mechanisms;home-automation techniques;remote control scheme;ubiquitous personal computing","","1","2","10","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its great for organizations that can accept the “people-time” required to keep clusters up and running, but for the commercial side of technical computing, the software solutions available today just are not up to the task. We believe that the best way to solve our HPC software problems is to work together. Intel has worked to create cross-industry groups dedicated to solving HPC software problems. On the shared memory front, we are active in the OpenMP Architecture Review Board. Working with this group, we have helped standardize API's for shared memory programming. For clusters, we have helped found the Open Cluster Group. The Open Cluster Group is an informal consortium of commercial and research organizations interested in cluster-computing. Our mission is to make clusters a realistic option for organizations that use high performance computing to accomplish their goals. The first project from the Open Cluster Group is OSCAR: a fully integrated easy to install bundle of software designed to make it easy to build and use a cluster for high performance computing.

In this paper, we propose a Cloud computing framework, which is responsible to distribute and schedule a Cluster-Based data mining application and its data set. The main goal of our proposed framework for scheduling of Big Data Mining (FSBD) is to decrease the overall execution time of the application with minimum loss in mining quality. We consider the Cluster-based data mining technique as a pilot application for our framework. The results show an important speedup with a minimum loss in quality of mining. We obtained a ratio of 2 of the normalized actual makespan vis-a-vis the ideal makespan. The quality of mining scales well with the number of clusters and the increasing size of the dataset. The results are promising, encouraging the adoption of the framework by Cloud providers.","","978-1-4799-5056-0","","10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906823","Autonomous Computing;Cloud Computing;Data Mining;Distributed Systems;Divisible Load Application;High Performance Computing;Scheduling","Big data;Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data mining;Scheduling algorithms","Big Data;cloud computing;data mining;pattern clustering;scheduling","FSBD;cloud computing;cluster-based data mining application;framework for scheduling of big data mining;mining quality;normalized actual makespan","","0","","22","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two mechanisms for BBS construction, dubbed RAD_Expansion and G_Search, have been developed and evaluated empirically, and RAD_Expansion is found to be more desirable. Our transport-layer barrier primitive is then implemented on the BBS constructed using RAD_Expansion, with AODV as its underlying network protocol, for evaluation using NS-2.

Honoring SLAs is a multi-faceted problem that may involve optimal use of the available resources, optimization of the system's performance and availability or maximization of the provider's revenue and it poses a significant challenge for researchers and system administrators due to the volatile, huge and unpredictable Web environments where these computing systems reside. The use of algorithms possessing run-time adaptation features, such as dynamic resource allocation, admission control and optimization becomes an absolute must. As a continuation of the recent successful application of control theory concepts and methods to the computing systems area, our survey indicates that the problem of honoring SLAs on cloud computing services is a new interesting application for control theory and that researchers can benefit significantly from a number of well-known modern control methodologies, such as hybrid, supervisory, hierarchical and model predictive control.","","978-3-9524173-9-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7074401","","Cloud computing;Decision support systems;Europe;Handheld computers","Internet;cloud computing;contracts;control engineering computing;quality of service","QoS guaranteed computing dynamic environments;SLAs;Web environments;cloud computing services;control theory concepts;run-time adaptation features;service level agreements","","0","","38","","","23-26 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first workshop on Enabling Technologies for Peta(FL)ops Computing in February, 1996 provided a first examination of the potential opportunities and challenges to the future achievement of petaflops computing systems. Subsequent workshops have addressed hardware, architecture, and software issues. The Petaflops Architecture WorkShop (PAWS) in April, 1996 concentrated on alternative architecture approaches to petaflops computer systems development. The Petaflops System Software Summer Study (PetaSoft) in June, 1996 focused on the fundamental problem of system software, its requirements, and approaches to supporting petaflops computing. An important element in both workshops was a set of sponsored studies in near-petaflops architecture initiated by NSF in cooperation with NASA and DARPA. The eight studies proposed a number of approaches to petaflops systems architecture including software.

In pervasive computing systems, the users are frequently hopping from one computing space to another, which makes user profile management an essential component of the system. Because such a dynamic-populated computing system has to be new corner-friendly, malicious users with bad reputation to a system may take advantage of the system by claiming themselves as new users. In addition, user identity can also be compromised by controlling the victim node via normal invasions or even by inside identity thefts. A valid user identity is the foundation and prerequisite of trust. Failures to correctly identify a user are catastrophic to trust management system. Traditional intrusion detection systems can only detect an attack when it already happens. But before the intrusion the attackers may have some specific behavioral signatures indicating of their suspicious identities.

We first point out that today's traditional ldquointelligentrdquo computing is built on strong and hard-coded logical assumptions and computational procedures which are pre-defined by developers, that is, what we call as simulated intelligence within the course of this paper. Such assumptions and procedures are based on enumerations of possible contexts of use which is predefined mappings between situations in contextual space to rational behaviors in behavior space. However pervasive computing applications extend the scope of application's context space and behavior space towards infinity which hardens development of ldquointelligentrdquo systems having a certain degree of rationality. Therefore, approaches merging human intelligence and computing ldquointelligencerdquo are required to be employed. We further advocate that pervasive computing era increases the complexity of application development because of the extended context space, hence software development approaches based on higher abstractions need to be employed where model driven approaches and ontology driven approaches are promising. We propose a basic methodology which merges model driven and ontology driven development approaches. Resulting methodology employs use of formalized conceptual models to be employed both at run-time and development time in terms of reasoning and automatic code generation respectively. We finally point out that such application development paradigm based on pervasive computing perspective will enable users to program their own environment (i.e. smart spaces) in the future.","","978-1-4244-5021-3","978-1-4244-5023-7","10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291915","Environment Programming;Model Driven Development;Ontology Driven Development;Pervasive Computing;Simulated Intelligence;Smart Spaces;Software Development;Web of Things;component","Application software;Computational intelligence;Computational modeling;Context modeling;H infinity control;Humans;Merging;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Programming","ontologies (artificial intelligence);software engineering;ubiquitous computing","application behavior space;application context space;automatic code generation;intelligent application development;model driven system development;ontology driven system development;pervasive computing environments;simulated intelligence;software development approaches","","1","","33","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, new phenomena continue to emerge in many industries' evolution processes, thereby limiting the effectiveness of conventional systems approaches as a basis for intelligent computing applications. Therefore, it becomes critical to recognize the nature and manifestation of a system of systems (SoS) environment, and to develop a corresponding pathway to holistic intelligent computing methodology. This paper discusses the intelligence computing process and suggests that the key application fields in challenging system of systems environment include SoS complexity, indistinction of component boundaries, hidden systems processes, holistic emergent behaviors, uncertainty and unpredictability. Furthermore, taking tourism as an example of typical complex industrial SoS, a technical system of systems engineering framework is presented as a basis for industrial analysis and policy making process. The framework focuses: 1) SoS virtualization through geographical intelligent computing; 2) SoS process simulation using network algorithms; 3) SoS evaluation though progressive analysis approach. This integrated methodology is to be tested in empirical study. Though SoS engineering remains full of challenges and opportunities, exploration of its role and its coupling with intelligent computing in complex task of managing industrial systems will have tremendous influence to management discipline.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514195","industrial analysis;intelligent computing;policy making;system of systems (SoS);tourism","Artificial intelligence;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Industries","artificial intelligence;digital simulation;geography;travel industry","SoS complexity;SoS environment;SoS evaluation;SoS process simulation;SoS virtualization;artificial intelligence system;component boundary indistinction;geographical intelligent computing;hidden system process;holistic emergent behavior;industrial management;industry evolution process;intelligent computing methodology;network algorithms;policy making;progressive analysis approach;system of systems environment;technical system of systems engineering framework;tourism industrial analysis;uncertainty;unpredictability","","0","","15","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However with own premises and investment in IT infrastructure scaling process can be slow and costly. Moreover, even if organizations scale up their IT infrastructure, these are hardly able to achieve the optimal utilization of the same. This has been a major hurdle in organizations decision to invest huge capital and resources for scaling up its operations. All this has forced companies to continuously look for innovative solutions in the form of new technological solutions that are easy as well as cost effective. One such technology that has come as a boon today is cloud computing. “Cloud computing” is a paradigm shift to provide computing over the internet. It implements Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) resulting in less investment on IT infrastructure, rapid elasticity and finally reduced total cost of ownership. However, implementing Cloud Computing is not so easy and there are lot of issues that may need to be taken care of before it can deliver intended benefits. Unfortunately, there is not enough of research available which has researched various implementations issues in a structured way. In this paper, we have made an attempt to understand the concept of cloud computing in detail and tried to structure major issues that may arise while implementing cloud computing after reviewing the literature thoroughly. Further, apart from identifications of these key issues, possible solutions as suggested by the practitioners have been also been discussed.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100266","Cloud computing;Implementation issues;rapid elasticity;scaling process","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Licenses;NIST","business data processing;cloud computing;organisational aspects;service-oriented architecture","IT infrastructure scaling process;Internet;SOA;business needs;cloud computing implementation;service oriented architecture;total ownership cost reduction","","0","","","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is particularly suitable for systems that are based on a centralized arbiter for making control decisions. Many applications in LAN-based computing, online transactions, and telecommunication systems fall into this category. The method exploits the inherent physical separation of distributed computing systems to achieve high reliability in the face of decentralized arbiter failures. A significant feature of the method is that the fault-tolerance mechanisms are imbedded in the normal control signal flow so that the overhead is practically negligible in the absence of faults. The principles behind the method, its internal structure, and its operations are explained. Also, the experience gained through its application is discussed.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-2051-X","","10.1109/FTCS.1990.89343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=89343","","Centralized control;Concurrent computing;Control systems;Distributed computing;Distributed control;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Telecommunication computing;Telecommunication control;Topology","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;hierarchical systems","LAN-based computing;centralized arbiter;decentralized arbiter failures;distributed computing systems;fault-tolerant strategy;hierarchical control;online transactions;physical separation;telecommunication systems","","0","1","14","","","26-28 June 1990","26 Jun 1990-28 Jun 1990","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a framework of mobile transparent computing (MTC) by efficient integration of transparent computing and mobile computing. The MTC environment is a kind of decentralized networks that consist of mobile terminals and wireless links with the conspicuous characteristics: i.e., heterogeneous hardware architecture, diversified operating system (OS), closely coupling between hardware and software and unreliable network. However, these characters make it difficult to manage and allocate the resources and services in MTC. Therefore, we put forward a kind of shared resources and services management (SRSM) strategy for MTC with the ability of compatibility to multiple hardware architectures and mobile OSes. It is designed in a three layered architecture, i.e., the user layer, manage layer and resource layer. In the user layer, the virtualization technology is used to monitor heterogeneous mobile devices and decouple between hardware and software. After that, we run a user agent in each mobile device to collect resources information and requirements on it. The resource layer located in the server is responsible for central storage of resources and services including mobile OSes. The manage layer with several mobile agents on it acts as the core manager in SRSM. Through the interaction of user agent and mobile agents, the resources and services are scheduled and accounted dynamically on demand. Practical experiments on several development boards have testified that the proposed strategy is effective and stable under MTC circumstances.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832147","mobile transparent computing;service management;shared resource","Hardware;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Resource management;Servers","mobile agents;mobile computing;operating systems (computers);resource allocation;virtualisation","MTC environment;SRSM strategy;decentralized networks;hardware architectures;heterogeneous mobile device monitoring;manage layer;mobile OS;mobile agents;mobile terminals;mobile transparent computing;resource allocation;resource layer;shared resources and services management;three layered architecture;user agent;user layer;virtualization technology;wireless links","","0","","15","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is primarily due to the dynamic, mobile, unpredictable and heterogeneous environment of ubiquitous computing systems. Middleware provide solutions to common tasks in ubiquitous computing, e.g. communication, discovery, deployment, personalisation, group management etc. Middleware are developed using frameworks. Existing frameworks such as CORBA component model, Webservices, and Jini support middleware in certain aspects, e.g. communication protocols, but restrict them to certain assumptions, e.g. no disconnected operation or the client/server model.

However, security concerns are terrible for these systems whose infrastructure and computational resources are owned by an outside party that sells those services to the general public. In fact, data breaches to cloud services are also increasing every year due to hackers who are always trying to exploit the security vulnerabilities of the cloud architecture.

In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and monitoring of resources, services, and computations can be challenging due to the considerable diversity, large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Hence, information services are a vital part of any grid software infrastructure, providing fundamental mechanisms for discovery and monitoring, and thus for planning and adapting application behavior. This paper proposes a resource discovery system for grid computing with fault-tolerant capabilities starting from an SSI clustering operating system. The proposed system uses dynamic leader-determination and registration mechanisms to automatically recover from nodes and network failures. The system is centralized and uses dynamic (or soft-state) registration to detect and recover from failures. Provisional or backup leader determination provides tolerance and recovery in the event of the leader node failing. The system was tested against a control network modeled after existing grid computing resource discovery components, such as Globus monitoring and discovery system (MDS). In various failure scenarios, the proposed system showed better resilience and performance than the control system","","0-7695-2694-2","","10.1109/GCC.2006.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031470","fault tolerance;grid operating systems;high performance computing.;resource discovery","Application software;Automatic control;Condition monitoring;Distributed computing;Fault tolerant systems;Grid computing;Large-scale systems;Operating systems;Resilience;System testing","fault tolerant computing;grid computing;information services;operating systems (computers)","Globus monitoring and discovery system;SSI clustering operating system;dynamic leader-determination;fault tolerance;grid computing;grid software infrastructure;high performance computing;information service;large-scale resource sharing;registration mechanism;resource discovery","","1","","22","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, increasing efforts have recently been devoted to guaranteeing VM performance for tenants. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art research on managing the performance overhead of VMs, and summarize them under diverse scenarios of the IaaS cloud, ranging from the single-server virtualization, a single mega datacenter, to multiple geodistributed datacenters. Specifically, we unveil the causes of VM performance overhead by illustrating representative scenarios, discuss the performance modeling methods with a particular focus on their accuracy and cost, and compare the overhead mitigation techniques by identifying their effectiveness and implementation complexity. With the obtained insights into the pros and cons of each existing solution, we further bring forth future research challenges pertinent to the modeling methods and mitigation techniques of VM performance overhead in the IaaS cloud.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2013.2287711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670704","Cloud computing;predictable performance;virtual machine (VM) performance overhead;virtualization","Cloud computing;Data centers;Performance evaluation;Servers;Virtual machining;Virtualization;Wide area networks","cloud computing;computer centres;software performance evaluation;virtual machines;virtualisation","IaaS cloud;VM contention;VM performance;VM performance overhead mitigation techniques;VM performance overhead modeling methods;datacenters;geodistributed datacenters;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing;leased computing resources;shared computing resources;single mega datacenter;single-server virtualization;virtual machine on demand;virtual machine performance overhead management","","0","","96","","","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Various algorithms and protocols (MD5, AES, and RSA-based PHE) are implemented by the various components of this model to provide the maximum levels of integrity management and privacy preservation for data stored in public cloud such as Amazon S3. The impact of algorithms and protocols, used to ensure data integrity and privacy, is studied to test the performance of the proposed model. The prototype system showed that data integrity and privacy are ensured against unauthorized parties. This model reduces the burden of checking the integrity of data stored in cloud storage by utilizing a third party, integrity checking service, and applies security mechanism that ensure privacy and confidentiality of data stored in cloud computing.

This new architecture poses new challenges: algorithms must be redesigned to take advantage of this architecture and programming models differ between vendors, hindering the portability of algorithms across heterogeneous platforms. Recently, OpenCL has been regarded as the standard programming model for heterogeneous platforms. With the future of general purpose computing moving towards APUs, in this paper, we study the design and implementation of two problems: 0-1 knapsack and Gaussian Elimination in OpenCL.

However most if not all implementations of MapReduce are coupled to a specific infrastructure. SAGA is a high-level programming interface which provides the ability to create distributed applications in an infrastructure independent way. In this paper, we show how MapReduce has been implemented using SAGA and demonstrate its interoperability across different distributed platforms - Grids, Cloud-like infrastructure and Clouds. We discuss the advantages of programmatically developing MapReduce using SAGA, by demonstrating that the SAGA-based implementation is infrastructure independent whilst still providing control over the deployment, distribution and runtime decomposition. The ability to control the distribution and placement of the computation units (workers) is critical in order to implement the ability to move computational work to the data. This is required to keep data network transfer low and in the case of commercial Clouds the monetary cost of computing the solution low. Using data-sets of size up to 10GB, and upto 10 workers, we provide detailed performance analysis of the SAGA-MapReduce implementation, and show how controllingthe distribution of computation and the payload per worker helps enhance performance.","","978-1-4244-3935-5","978-0-7695-3622-4","10.1109/CCGRID.2009.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071908","SAGA;clouds grids;data intensive;mapreduce","Cloud computing;Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Performance analysis;Runtime;Size control;USA Councils","application program interfaces;grid computing;parallel programming","MapReduce data-parallel programming model;SAGA programming interface;cloud computing;data intensive computing;data network transfer;distributed application;grid computing;programming abstraction","","6","","11","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, inspired by traditional activity theory and qualitative process theory, we present a goal directed human activity computing model.

TFTP(Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is implemented to transfer data between client and server in wired LAN(Local Area Network) and is known for simplicity. However, because of the difference between wired and wireless LAN, TFTP is useless in WLAN(Wireless Local Area Network). TFTP uses a lock-step algorithm. That means after sending a data packet, the sender has to wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver before sending the next data packet. So that the transfer rate is limited by the RTT (round-trip time). The WLAN usually has a long latency, in other words, the RTT of WLAN is much higher than LAN, which means that the server is waiting for the arrival of acknowledgement during the most of time during the data transmission process, and wireless channel is idle because there is only one packet being transferred. The TFTP transfer rate is extremely low. To solve this problem, ``transfer window'' scheme is introduced into TFTP. Meanwhile, in Mobile Transparent Computing, the transmission medium is 802.11a/b/g, and they all provide multi-rate capabilities, which means the bit rate of the wireless channel is changing dynamically, and consequently, the throughout of the channel is changing dynamically. Therefore, constant window size is not suitable for the TFTP in Mobile Transparent Computing. In this paper, we propose an improvement of TFTP named DTFTP(Dynamic Trivial File Transfer Protocol). DTFTP is based on a cross-layer design, in which the window size changes reasonably along with the bit rate change. The throughout increases about 54 percent when we use DTFTP to transfer data in Mobile Transparent Computing.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832151","Trivial File Transfer Protocol;cross-layer feedback;mobile intelligent terminals;transparent computing","Acceleration;Bit rate;Mobile communication;Operating systems;Protocols;Servers;Wireless LAN","client-server systems;data communication;mobile computing;operating systems (computers);peer-to-peer computing;protocols;wireless LAN;wireless channels","DTFTP;IEEE 802.11a/b/g;RTT;TFTP transfer rate;WLAN;acknowledgement;bit rate change;channel throughout;client load operating system;client server system;cross layer design;data transfer;data transmission process;dynamic trivial file transfer protocol;local area network;lock-step algorithm;mobile transparent computing;multirate capability;packet transfer;round-trip time;transfer window scheme;wired LAN;wireless LAN;wireless channel;wireless network","","0","","12","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, Resource allocation is a challenging but very necessary problem in cluster computing. In an effort to maximize a service provider's profit, it is commonplace and important to prioritize customer services in favor of those who are willing to pay higher fees. In this paper, we consider a set of computing resources owned by a service provider who serves differentiated customer services subject to an SLA for scientific applications that often require parallel computation. The QoS defined in the paper includes percentile response time and cluster utilization. We present an approach for optimal resource allocation in cluster computing systems in that we minimize the total cost of computing resources owned by a service provider while satisfying multiple priority customer service requirements. Our simulation experiments show that the proposed approach is applicable to the resource allocation in a cluster computing system with multiple customer services.","","978-1-4577-1564-8","978-0-7695-4538-7","10.1109/HPCC.2011.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063002","Cluster computing;percentile response time;priority-type customer service;resource allocation;scheduling theory","Computational modeling;Customer services;Measurement;Quality of service;Resource management;Servers;Time factors","parallel processing;quality of service;resource allocation","cluster computing;cluster utilization;multiple priority customer service requirement;parallel computation;percentile response time;priority-type resource allocation;quality of service;service level agreement","","0","","20","","","2-4 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, due to rapid expansion of smart phone market and wireless communication environment, mobile devices are considered as resource for large scale distributed processing. But mobile devices have several problems, such as unstable wireless connection, limitation of power capacity, low communication bandwidth and frequent location changes. As resource providers, mobile devices can join and leave the distributed computing environment unpredictably. This interrupts the undergoing operation, and the delay or failure of completing the operation may cause a system failure. Because of low reliability and no-guarantee of completing an operation, it is difficult to use a mobile device as a resource. That means that mobile devices are volatile. Therefore, we should consider volatility, one of dynamic characteristics of mobile devices, for stable resource provision. In this paper, we propose a monitoring technique based on the Markov Chain model, which analyzes and predicts resource states. With the proposed monitoring technique and state prediction, a cloud system will get more resistant to the fault problem caused by the volatility of mobile devices. The proposed technique diminishes the volatility of a mobile device through modeling the patterns of past states and making a prediction of future state of a mobile device.","","978-1-61284-829-7","978-0-7695-4338-3","10.1109/WAINA.2011.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763554","Markov Chain;Mobile Cloud Computing;Monitoring;Monitoring Time Interval;Pattern","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Markov processes;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Monitoring;Probability","Markov processes;cloud computing;mobile computing;software fault tolerance","Markov chain based monitoring service;distributed processing;fault tolerance;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;mobile devices;power capacity limitation;smart phone market;wireless communication environment;wireless connection","","7","","20","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system proposes a migration framework for mobile application based ubiquitous computing as well as it provides for mobility. The main goal of our proposed framework is to enable a seamless user-experience when users move around in a ubiquitous computing environment whether the application is in local or global environment.

Cloud computing has many challenges, among them, the specification of work platforms in a cloud environment. In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers.

It is argued that the threats associated with the first two levels can be handled by employing operating system virtualization technologies based on Xen, whereas the threats of the third level require the use of hardware security modules proposed in the context of the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA).

Clouds per se are elastic computing infrastructure where mobile applications can offload or draw tasks in an on-demand push-pull manner. Lightweight and portable task migration support enabling better resource utilization and data access locality is the key for success of mobile cloud computing. Existing task migration mechanisms are however too coarse-grained and costly, offsetting the benefits from migration and hampering flexible task partitioning among the mobile and cloud resources. We propose a new computation migration technique called stack-on-demand (SOD) that exports partial execution states of a stack machine to achieve agile mobility, easing into small-capacity devices and flexible distributed execution in a multi-domain workflow style. Our design also couples SOD with a novel object faulting technique for efficient access to remote objects. We implement the SOD concept into a middleware system for transparent execution migration of Java programs. It is shown that SOD migration cost is pretty low, comparing to several existing migration mechanisms. We also conduct experiments with an iPhone handset to demonstrate the elasticity of SOD by which server-side heavyweight processes can run adaptively on the cell phone.","0190-3918","978-1-4244-7913-9","978-0-7695-4156-3","10.1109/ICPP.2010.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599165","cloud computing;computation migration;mobile agents;stack-on-demand;strong mobility","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computational modeling;Java;Message systems;Mobile communication;Runtime","Internet;Java;middleware;mobile computing;task analysis","Java programs;SOD migration;cell phone;cloud resources;computation migration technique;data access locality;elastic computing infrastructure;hampering flexible task partitioning;iPhone handset;middleware system;mobile cloud computing;multidomain workflow style;object faulting technique;portable task migration mechanism;resource utilization;stack machine;stack-on-demand execution model;transparent execution migration","","4","","19","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sporadic contention is caused by on-demand requests when organizations seek to consume large amounts of resource from each other. For this reason, admission control mechanisms need to be incorporated to prevent oversubscription of shared resources. The major constrain in admission control is that requests are handled FCFS. As such, the service-level agreement (SLA) cannot be changed by the system at the discretion of the resource manager. We characterize this problem as non-preemptive admission control. In this paper, we introduce a resource scheduling framework for admission control in a grid computing environment for this purpose. It is built on a reference pricing model and utility functions.

The success of such a billing system depends on several factors: The billing transactions must have integrity and nonrepudiation capabilities; the billing transactions must be nonobstructive and have a minimal computation cost; and the service level agreement (SLA) monitoring should be provided in a trusted manner. Existing billing systems are limited in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and nonobstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. The cloud notary authority generates mutually verifiable binding information that can be used to resolve future disputes between a user and a cloud service provider in a computationally efficient way. Furthermore, to provide a forgery-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. The performance evaluation confirms that the overall latency of THEMIS billing transactions (avg. 4.89 ms) is much shorter than the latency of public key infrastructure (PKI)-based billing transactions (avg. 82.51 ms), though THEMIS guarantees identical security features as a PKI.

Proceedings. 11th International Conference on","20051114","2005","1","","328","334 Vol. 1","This paper presents the design principles of an advanced multicast router and evaluates its performance in experiments. Our multicast router features cluster computing, which has been used to develop a high performance search engine and grid computing. The router consists of a small-scale cluster attached to a regular router. While it is not a standard router architecture, it offers high extensibility and availability without much investment. Our design is based on the new multicast technology called Flexcast by Inoue, Tani, Ishimaru, Minato and Miyazaki, (2003), which naturally supports incremental deployment of the multicast infrastructure unlike IP multicast. In Flexcast, multicast packets are replicated at each router like IP multicast. However, Flexcast is implemented in the layer above the network layer; the multicast stream is transmitted by unicast between routers that support Flexcast, and bypasses routers that do not support it. The goal of this paper is to bring the concept of incremental deployment to a multicast router as well as the protocol, by means of cluster computing. We implemented several routers on Linux PCs and tested them in experiments. The results of the experiments reveal that forwarding performance and availability are greatly enhanced by cluster computing. Our efforts provide the economy, efficiency, and extensibility needed to realize the multicast infrastructure.","1521-9097","0-7695-2281-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2005.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531146","","Availability;Computer architecture;Grid computing;High performance computing;Investments;Linux;Multicast protocols;Personal communication networks;Search engines;Unicast","IP networks;grid computing;multicast communication;performance evaluation;routing protocols;search engines;workstation clusters","Flexcast;IP multicast;Linux PC;advanced multicast router;cluster computing;grid computing;high performance search engine;multicast packets;multicast stream;multicast technology;performance evaluation;small-scale cluster;standard router architecture","","0","","16","","","20-22 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Components that may reside in different security domains have to cooperate to achieve higher-level missions. To ease the programmer's burden, we are developing an MLS workflow management system (WFMS), called MLS METEOR. A programmer can specify a distributed programming logic through a GUI based workflow design tool. Based on the programming logic, MLS METEOR will generate a distributed runtime system that handles communication among different hosts, even those that reside in different classification domains, The multilevel security enforcement of MLS METEOR does not depend on the WFMS itself but rather on the underlying MLS infrastructure and a few security critical components. The paper concentrates on the system organization of MLS METEOR and the rationale for this structure.

Nevertheless, security is one of the main factors that inhibit the proliferation of cloud computing. Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) is a new breed of security and economical threats to the cloud computing. Unlike the traditional Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) which brings down a particular service by exhausting the resources of the server in traditional setup, EDoS takes advantage of the elasticity of the cloud service. This causes the resources to dynamically scale to meet the demand (as a result of EDoS attack) resulting in a hefty bill for the customer. In this survey, we review various EDoS mitigation techniques that have been introduced in recent years.","","978-1-4799-6895-4","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014767","Cloud Computing;DDoS;EDoS;Security;Survey","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Economics;Filtering;Resource management","cloud computing;computer network security;economics;information technology;software architecture","DDoS;EDoS attack;cloud computing architecture;commoditized service;distributed denial of service;economic denial of sustainability;information and communication technology;mitigation techniques;subscription-based services","","0","","14","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This threatens the security of online operations for enterprises and end users, and consequently affects cloud computing solutions. Although cloud computing provides appealing benefits in terms of costs reduction, while increasing productivity, it introduces uncharted security issues (e.g., see [1]) beyond the ones inherited from the Internet. The emergence of mobile computing also makes authentication a priority, and has been reinforcing the need to build stronger and more resilient mechanisms; and simultaneously providing the means to develop new authentication mechanisms, namely Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) schemes. The convergence to Single Sign-On (SSO) models is being used to eliminate or decrease password management complexity. MFA mostly appears in the form of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanisms based on One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for the second factor after standard password authentication. Such mechanisms can be based on public-key cryptography and may resort to several technologies to improve user experience, namely Quick Response (QR) codes, Short Message Service (SMSes), Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), or even contactless Near Field Communication (NFC). Another trend leans to the adoption of risk-based authentication. Efforts for securing authentication are mainly being undertaken by the Initiative for Open AuTHentication (OATH) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance.","","978-1-4799-3213-9","","10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742763","","Authentication;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Cryptography;Logic gates;Prototypes","cloud computing;public key cryptography","2FA mechanisms;FIDO alliance;Fast Identity Online alliance;Internet;MFA schemes;NFC;OATH;OTP;Open Authentication;QR codes;Quick Response codes;SMS;SSO models;Short Message Service;TPM;cloud computing management interfaces;cloud computing solutions;contactless near field communication;cost reduction;mobile computing;multifactor authentication schemes;one-factor authentication;one-time passwords;online operation security;password management complexity;password-based mechanism security;public-key cryptography;risk-based authentication;secure user authentication;single sign-on models;standard password authentication;trusted platform modules;two-factor authentication mechanisms;uncharted security issues;user experience","","0","","5","","","6-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The explosion in the availability of information in various media forms and through multiple sensors and devices means, on one hand, that the amount of data we can collect will continue to increase dramatically, and, on the other hand, that we need to develop new paradigms to search, organize, and integrate such information to support all human activities. Human centered computing (HCC) is an emerging field that aims at bridging the existing gaps between the various disciplines involved with the design and implementation of computing systems that support people's activities. HCC aims at tightly integrating human sciences (e.g. social and cognitive) and computer science (e.g. human-computer interaction (HO), signal processing, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing) for the design of computing systems with a human focus from beginning to end. This focus should consider the personal, social, and cultural contexts in which such systems are deployed. Beyond being a meeting place for existing disciplines, HCC also aims at radically changing computing with new methodologies to design and build systems that support and enrich people's lives. In this presentation, we discuss the existing challenges in HCC and describe what we consider to be the three main areas of interest: media production, analysis, and interaction. In addition, we identify the core characteristics of HCC, describe example applications.and propose a research agenda for HCC.","","978-1-4244-0832-0","978-1-4244-0832-0","10.1109/ICDEW.2007.4400966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4400966","","Computer science;Cultural differences;Explosions;History;Human computer interaction;Machine learning;Pervasive computing;Signal design;Signal processing;Ubiquitous computing","social aspects of automation","computer science;cultural context;human activities;human sciences;human-centered computing;media analysis;media interaction;media production;personal context;social context","","0","","","","","17-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IEEE/ACS International Conference on","20041122","2004","","","7","","Summary form only given. The wide deployment of Internet technology has resulted in exponential growth in Internet application services (e.g., content hosting for data with Web-based access, shared payroll applications, firewall-based security services, email and shared file services). The management and control of these application services is a challenging research problem due to the huge amount of data that needs to be collected and coordinated, the heterogeneity and the independence of resources and components required by these services and the fact that they run under different organizations and administration policies. This complexity has led to a situation where the cost to manage such systems is actually a lot more than the actual systems themselves. Consequently, the growing complexity of the IT infrastructure threatens to undermine the very benefits information technology aims to provide. A potential solution to these challenging research problems is autonomic computing that calls for designing distributed information systems that can automatically configure, deploy, secure, tolerate faults, optimize, and anticipate loads by themselves without the manual involvement of human administrators. This approach has been inspired by the human autonomic nervous system that has the ability to self-configure, self-tune and even repair themselves without any human conscience involvement. The concept of developing the next era of computing systems is driven by the convergence between the biological systems and the digital computing systems. In this paper, the author reviews the basic principles of autonomic computing, related research projects in industry and academia and future research directions and opportunities. In addition, the author describes our on-going research projects to develop autonomia: an autonomic control and management environment.","","0-7803-8577-2","","10.1109/PERSER.2004.1356753","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356753","","Biology computing;Costs;Data security;Design optimization;Distributed computing;Distributed information systems;Humans;Information technology;Resource management;Web and internet services","Internet;information systems;information technology;ubiquitous computing","IT infrastructure;Internet application services;Internet technology;autonomic computing;autonomic control;biological systems;digital computing systems;distributed information systems;human autonomic nervous system;information technology;management environment","","0","","","","","19-23 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the underlying implementation and performance of clouds are very different from those at traditional supercomputing centers. It is therefore critical to evaluate the performance of HPC applications in today's cloud environments to understand the tradeoffs inherent in migrating to the cloud. This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation to date comparing conventional HPC platforms to Amazon EC2, using real applications representative of the workload at a typical supercomputing center. Overall results indicate that EC2 is six times slower than a typical mid-range Linux cluster, and twenty times slower than a modern HPC system.

Job scheduling is a major problem since it is a fundamental and crucial step in achieving high performance. The job scheduling problem has been treated as a combinatorial-optimization problem. Scheduling in a Grid environment can be seen as an extension to the scheduling problem on local parallel systems. In the research, we focus on applying the technologies of RFID and Grid computing to the architecture of the EPC network. There are many applications needing computing power of the Grid to deal with the huge quantity of incoming EPC data. According to the architecture of the EPC network and the environment of Grid computing, they have several similar characteristics. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm that modifies the traditional GA and integrates SA. Since the processes of GA and SA keep no memory, some problems may be visited again. In order to overcome this drawback, we design a learning scheme to remember visited statues to reduce the probability of the re-visiting improvement the performance in the search space. It can help to find the optimal or near-optimal scheduling efficiently and avoid the resource deadlock. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm, HGASA - with learning scheme, also considers about several properties of grid computing environment and EPC network, such as heterogeneity, dynamic adaptation and the independent relationship of jobs.","","0-7695-2408-7","","10.1109/SCC.2005.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524426","","Computer applications;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Grid computing;Information security;Processor scheduling;Radiofrequency identification;Resource management;Routing;System recovery","combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;grid computing;probability;radiofrequency identification;scheduling;search problems;simulated annealing","HGASA;RFID EPC network;Savant;combinatorial-optimization problem;dynamic adaptation;grid computing;grid environment;job scheduling;learning;near-optimal scheduling;parallel systems;probability;resource deadlock;search space","","3","","11","","","11-15 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These issues are extremely significant but there is still much room for security research in cloud computing. This paper focuses more on the issues related to the data security and privacy aspects in cloud computing, such as data integrity, data intrusion, service availability. It proposes a Multi-clouds Database Model (MCDB) which is based on Multi-clouds service providers instead of using single cloud service provider such as in Amazon cloud service. In addition, it will discuss and present the architecture of the proposed MCDB model and describe its components and layers.

However, the achieved performance when a certain program is executed is significantly lower than the maximal theoretical performance of the large-scale computing system. The model-based performance evaluation may be used to support the performance-oriented program development for large-scale computing systems. In this paper we present a hybrid approach for performance modeling and prediction of parallel and distributed computing systems, which combines mathematical modeling and discrete-event simulation. We use mathematical modeling to develop parameterized performance models for components of the system. Thereafter, we use discrete-event simulation to describe the structure of system and the interaction among its components. As a result, we obtain a high-level performance model, which combines the evaluation speed of mathematical models with the structure awareness and fidelity of the simulation model. We evaluate empirically our approach with a real-world material science program that comprises more than 15,000 lines of code.","","978-0-7695-3109-0","","10.1109/CISIS.2008.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606673","computing;hybrid performance modeling;large-scale systems;prediction","Communication system software;Competitive intelligence;Computational modeling;Discrete event simulation;Distributed computing;Large-scale systems;Materials science and technology;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Programming profession","discrete event simulation;large-scale systems;parallel processing","discrete-event simulation;distributed computing;large-scale computing system;mathematical modeling;parallel computing","","3","","18","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Future production system is required to have more flexibility to deal with various problems for production auxiliary tasks in addition to production practices. In order to solve these problems, the use of field data from devices on the factory floor is required in many cases. For using the field data more effectively for auxiliary tasks, an approach to add functions to field devices is increasingly required. However, for building a computing environment that achieves this approach, it is necessary to solve the following two issues. (1) Provide field devices with the common computing environment independent of the device type. However, this environment should not adversely affect the original device functions for production practices. (2) Allow multiple persons in charge of auxiliary tasks to use the common computing environment concurrently. In other words, persons in charge can select necessary devices and build distributed applications on top of them without interfering with other activities.

Contemporary high performance computers equipped with co-processors such as GPUs primarily execute parallel applications using the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, which requires balanced computing resources of both microprocessor and co-processors to ensure full system utilization. While the inclusion of GPUs in HPC systems provides more computing resources and significant performance improvements, the asymmetrical distribution of the number of GPUs relative to the microprocessors can result in an underutilization of overall system computing resources. In this paper, we propose a GPU resource virtualization approach to allow underutilized microprocessors to share the GPUs. We analyze factors affecting the parallel execution performance on GPUs and conduct a theoretical performance estimation based on the most recent GPU architectures as well as the SPMD model. Then we present the implementation details of the virtualization infrastructure, followed by an experimental verification of the proposed concepts using an NVIDIA Fermi GPU computing node. The results demonstrate a considerable performance gain over the traditional SPMD execution without virtualization.

In the single-hop ad hoc grid heterogeneous environment considered in this study, tasks arrive unpredictably, are independent (i.e., no precedent constraints for tasks), and have priorities and deadlines. The problem is to map (match and schedule) tasks onto devices such that the number of highest priority tasks completed by their deadlines during eight hours is maximized while efficiently utilizing the overall system energy. A model for dynamically mapping tasks onto wireless devices is introduced.

Each computer works on its own workunits independently from each other and sends back its result to a project server. Installing, configuring, and maintaining a BOINC based project however is a highly sophisticated task. Scientists and developers need a lot of experience regarding the underlying communication and operating system technologies, even if only a handful of BOINC related functions are actually needed for most applications.

On the other hand, current trends in semiconductor scaling are raising concerns over “dark silicon” and suggest hardware accelerators are necessary to improve raw computing capability. Accelerators tend to give up flexibility to obtain efficiency and performance. This talk argues a consequence of these trends is that there is an urgent need to develop accelerators that are both energy efficient and easy to program. Such devices are required if usable computing capability is to improve in the face of expected challenges in semiconductor scaling. While efficiency is easier to measure than programmability this talk will argue both can be optimized simultaneously.

However, current experience shows that performance often falls well below user expectations and below what would be considered cost-effective. Therefore, MPC hardware and software designers need to focus on the factors which affect parallel computing efficiency, if they are to narrow the gap between potential and delivered performance. Many analyses of parallel computing efficiency which have been reported are mainly too restrictive to provide helpful results. Thus, a different approach is required which would help parallel architecture and algorithm designers to climb the learning curve associated with parallel computing efficiency. In this paper, a performance analysis is introduced which makes a distinction between natural parallelism (which is inherent to an application) and applied parallelism (which can be observed when an application is implemented on an MPC). By highlighting parallel computing bottlenecks the analysis supports MPC hardware and software designers to identify causes for inefficiency. Furthermore helpful efficiency measures can be defined. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the analysis and concludes that it could form the basis of a methodology which formalises the improvement of parallel computing efficiency","","0-7803-1862-5","","10.1109/TENCON.1994.369138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=369138","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Context modeling;Hardware;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Software design;Software performance","parallel processing;performance evaluation","MPC;cost-effective;learning curve;parallel algorithm;parallel architecture;parallel computing bottlenecks;parallel computing efficiency;performance analysis;software design;user expectations","","0","","15","","","22-26 Aug 1994","22 Aug 1994-26 Aug 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a noncooperative game is proposed to minimize the time and cost of scheduling.

Also, on the basis of granular computing, the decision system is divided into sub-systems, each of the subsystems is based on a block in the condition partition. So, a decision can be transferred from the decision system to a subsystem, which has simplified the decision process.

While there are many design issues associated with such systems, here we focus only on resource allocation problems, such as the design of algorithms for load balancing among servers, and algorithms for scheduling VM configurations. Given our model of a cloud, we first define its capacity, i.e., the maximum rates at which jobs can be processed in such a system.

However, psychophysiology experiments in the literature offer additional measures (such as eye-blink startle response) not yet exploited in affective computing applications. Procedures to elicit eye-blink startle responses are often based on acoustic stimuli, in particular short bursts of intense white noise. Unfortunately, following this approach in affective computing applications would not be natural, because the artificial white noise bursts would be intrusive sounds unrelated to the user experience. They would thus distract the user from the meaningful events in the application and user's (conscious or unconscious) attempts to relate those events to the artificial stimuli would be unsuccessful and frustrating, making the stimuli detrimental to the user experience. Our research aims at exploring if sounds that have a meaningful relation with the events in the application could be used as an alternative to white noise bursts. The study we present in this paper compares physiological responses of users of a 3D virtual environment in two conditions (measurement of eye-blink startle response to white noise or to an alternative sound that is related to the experience), showing that the two types of acoustic stimuli produce a similar intensity of startle response. This result suggests that eye-blink startle response could be used in natural ways to extend the set of physiological measures employed in affective computing.","2156-8103","","","10.1109/ACII.2013.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681435","EMG;affective computing;eye-blink;natural noise;startle response;white noise","Acoustics;Affective computing;Electromyography;Explosions;Games;Physiology;White noise","biology computing;physiology;psychology","3D virtual environment;acoustic stimuli;additional measures;affective computing applications;artificial stimuli;artificial white noise bursts;eye blink startle response;heart rate variability;intrusive sounds;negative emotions;physiological measures;psychophysiology experiments;skin conductance;user experience","","0","","36","","","2-5 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the enlarging gap between the computing bandwidth and I/O bandwidth in projected next-generation HPC systems, this issue will become even worse. In this paper, we present a novel decoupled I/O to address the fundamental I/O bottleneck issue. The decoupled I/O is a software stack including MPI extensions, compiler improvements, and runtime library support, based one decoupled HPC system architecture. It allows users to treat the computing of data-intensive operations and the traditional I/O operation as an ensemble and offload them into dedicated data nodes, which are near to the data source, to reduce the overhead of data movement and improve the I/O bandwidth usage. The decoupled I/O is user-friendly and requires little changes in application codes. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the decoupled I/O, and the results show that it outperforms existing solutions (such as active storage I/O) and provides an attractive I/O solution for data-intensive high performance computing.","1530-2016","","","10.1109/ICPPW.2014.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103466","Decoupled I/O;data-intensive computing;high performance computing;parallel I/O;storage","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data processing;High performance computing;Libraries;Runtime","input-output programs;parallel processing","HPC system;MPI extension;compiler improvement;computing bandwidth;data-intensive high performance computing;data-intensive scientific application;decoupled input-output bottleneck;input-output bandwidth;message passing interface;runtime library support;software stack","","0","","","","","9-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing services in the form of Interface are small in granularity, lacking of semantics and distracting to invoke remotely. Existing components are lacking of a unified model for representing dependencies and a mechanism for dealing with these dependencies, especially the runtime dependency. In this paper, we extend the service and component in meta-level for pervasive computing. Firstly, we extend them in meta-model, making the service as the aggregation of Interface. Secondly, we entitle semantics to services by applying ontology and provide a new service invoking mechanism. Thirdly, we wrap Component by the enhanced service to decouple the compile-time and runtime dependencies; and introduce a novel group interaction mechanism for multi-service interaction.

Efficient utilization of the grid environment requires large amount of computing power. Scheduling independent jobs to the resources is not an easy task. Meta-scheduling schedules maximum number of jobs to the minimum amount of resources which is a very tedious task. Many scheduling algorithms exist to focus either on the job side or on the resource side. Existing Grid Meta - schedulers either target system-centric metrics, such as utilization and throughput, or prioritize jobs based on utility metrics provided by the users. In the proposed work, to utilize the power of grid completely, both the job and resources are taken into account. Jobs are prioritized based on the common location sum that considers both user and system priority.

However, making multiple applications running on different computing clouds would make it more difficult to deal with multiple cloud platforms and their differences. This paper presents a novel service and data management platform called DSP (Data Service Portal) in the cloud computing environment that facilitates the integration of applications by sharing their information in a loosely coupled manner. DSP enables applications to collectively exchange data through a platform in a fine-grained access control environment. The applications can work cooperatively, through the data sharing mechanism provided by the platform playing the role of a data broker, without being aware of each other's presence. An individual application can maintain its own data and run independently of the other applications in the platform. The data sharing mechanism enables the applications to offer (or subscribe to) a set of data to be consumed by (or produced by) the other applications in the platform. The platform publishes the data model along with APIs and guidelines for applications to adapt to the DSP platform and get to on-board to the platform for the subscriptions.","","978-1-4577-1592-1","978-1-4577-1590-7","10.1109/CEWIT.2011.6135872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6135872","Software-as-a-Service;application integration;data sharing;data trades","Cloud computing;Data models;Digital signal processing;Government;Portals","application program interfaces;authorisation;cloud computing;open systems;portals;signal processing","API;DSP platform;SaaS platform;application interoperability;application program interface;cloud computing;data broker;data management platform;data service portal;data sharing mechanism;digital signal processing;enterprise computing environment;fine-grained access control environment;service management platform;software application;software-as-a-service","","0","","7","","","2-3 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, from the simulation results, we can see that the framework is dynamic and lightweight enough to be applicable to in pervasive computing environments.","","978-1-4244-1311-9","","10.1109/WICOM.2007.554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4340329","","Authentication;Clouds;Cryptography;Educational institutions;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Pervasive computing;Risk analysis;Uncertainty","security of data;ubiquitous computing","pervasive computing environment;risk model;security model;trust modeling framework;uncertainty problem","","1","","15","","","21-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a given fixed sampling interval, the effects of computing time delay are classified into the delay and loss problems. The delay problem occurs when the computing time delay is nonzero but smaller than the sampling interval, while the loss problem occurs when the computing time delay is greater than, or equal to, the sampling interval, i.e., loss of the control output. These two problems are analyzed as a means of evaluating real-time control systems.

The three predominant service models are infrastructure, platform, and software-asa-service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) can be defined as the use of servers, storage, and virtualization to enable utility like services for users. Security is a big concern within IaaS, especially considering that the rest of the cloud service models run on top of the infrastructure and related layers. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer access to APIs, programming languages and development middleware which allows subscribers to develop custom applications without installing or configuring the development environment. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) gives subscribed or pay-peruse users access to software or services which reside in the cloud and not on the user's device. Understanding the cloud service models is critical in determining if cloud services or hosting are an appropriate business solution, and if so, which model best balances the level of control required versus reduced hardware, configuration, and maintenance costs. Cloud computing offers many benefits to organizations; it has enabled collaboration amongst disparate communities and workgroups, and has overcome challenges that have plagued existing business solutions. However, the security, privacy, and integrity of the cloud are of prime importance and there are many challenges that exist. At the present time there seems to be a lot of momentum behind the adoption of cloud computing despite these. This may simply be a trend, an indication that society truly wants their data to be available whenever from anywhere, or a sign that few understand the associated risks.","","978-1-4673-4793-8","","10.1109/CASoN.2012.6412402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6412402","IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;cloud benefits;cloud challenges;cloud computing;cloud layers;clouds;infrastructure as a service;platform as a service;privacy;security;service oriented;software as a service","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Hardware;Security;Software as a service","cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;middleware;security of data;virtualisation","API;IaaS;Infrastructure-as-a-Service;PaaS;Platform-as-a-Service;SaaS;Software-as-a-Service;Web-based value added services;cloud computing service models;cloud integrity;cloud privacy;cloud security;computing hardware;middleware;virtualization technologies","","4","","52","","","21-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As cloud computing is different from current data centers in terms of power management due to a dynamic structure and property for its online service. Power budgeting, in terms of its important role in power management, provides powerful solutions for cloud computing with dynamic capabilities. To be specific, existing methods for data centers are based on power distribution units (PDU) divided by fixed locations on physical levels. However, it is not suitable for cloud with the dynamic property. We propose a power management design based at the logical level which uses a distribution tree with classified power capping by different service or workload types.

This philosophy promises to provide new means for doing computation more efficiently-in terms of speed, cost, power dissipation, information storage, and solution quality. Simultaneously, cellular computing offers the potential of addressing much larger problem instances than previously possible, at least for some application domains. Cellular computing has attracted increasing research interest. Work in this field has produced results that hold prospects for a bright future. Yet questions must be answered before cellular computing can become a mainstream paradigm. What classes of computational tasks are most suited to it? How do we match the specific properties and behaviors of a given model to a suitable class of problems?

One of the guiding principles of this work has been to relieve the user of as much of the burden of interaction as possible by adding a sense of the real world to computer systems. The systems we have developed can be partitioned into three layers: at the bottom we have the sensors themselves; in the middle we have a layer of abstraction which takes the varied (and possibly voluminous) output of the range of installed sensors and makes this output available to applications in a succinct, uniform, robust and efficient manner using the latest database and distributed system technologies; and at the top we have the applications which use the processed sensor data provided by the middle layer to adapt their behaviour to the user's environment and preferences. We look at various sensors that we have built over the years, the abstractions through which the sensor information is presented, the applications that were developed to make use of this information, and the important issues that arose from our experiments in each case.

When identity information is associated with our personal and context information that is gathered by ubiquitous computing devices, personal privacy might be unprecedentedly sacrificed. People, however, have different privacy protection skills, awareness, and privacy preferences. Individuals can be uniquely identified on the basis of only a few identity elements used in combination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to understand the following issues and their relations: a) what identity elements people think are important; b) what actions people claim to take to protect their identities and privacy; c) privacy concerns; d) how people expose their identities in ubiquitous computing environments; and e) how our rational identity exposure model can help to minimize identity exposure. We build a simulated ubiquitous computing shopping system, called InfoSource. It consists of two applications and our rational identity exposure model. We present our experiments and statistical analysis results. Our data show that exposure decisions depend on participants' attitudes about maintaining privacy, but they do not depend on participants' concerns and claimed actions related to identity exposure. Our RationalExposure model helped participants to minimize unnecessary exposures.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326389","game theory;identity management;privacy;ubiqitous computing","Computational modeling;Data privacy;Game theory;Identity management systems;Internet;Pervasive computing;Protection;Statistical analysis;Ubiquitous computing;Wireless networks","data privacy;statistical analysis;ubiquitous computing","InfoSource;RationalExposure model;identity exposure;personal privacy protection;statistical analysis;ubiquitous computing","","0","","23","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a generalisation of the previous disk-less checkpointing approach for fault-tolerance in high performance computing systems. Our contribution is in two directions: first, instead of restricting to 2D checksums that tolerate only a small number of node failures, we propose to base disk-less checkpointing on linear codes to tolerate potentially a large number of faults. Then, we compare and analyse the use of low density parity check (LDPC) to classical Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with respect to different fault models to fit P2P systems. Our LDPC disk-less checkpointing method is well suited when only node disconnections are considered, but cannot deal with byzantine peers. Our RS disk-less checkpointing method tolerates such byzantine errors, but is restricted to exact finite field computations.","","978-1-4244-5084-8","978-0-7695-3831-0","10.1109/AP2PS.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359030","ABFT;P2P;SUMMA;distributed computing;fault-tolerance;linear coding","Checkpointing;Computer networks;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Galois fields;High performance computing;Linear code;Parity check codes;Peer to peer computing;Reed-Solomon codes","Reed-Solomon codes;checkpointing;fault tolerant computing;linear codes;parity check codes;peer-to-peer computing","LDPC;P2P computing network;Reed-Solomon code;algorithm-based fault tolerance;disk-less checkpointing;high performance computing system;linear code;low density parity check","","1","","13","","","11-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Source nodes in a directed acyclic network generate independent messages and a single receiver node computes a target function <i>f</i> of the messages. The objective is to maximize the average number of times <i>f</i> can be computed per network usage, i.e., the “computing capacity”. The network coding problem for a single-receiver network is a special case of the network computing problem in which all of the source messages must be reproduced at the receiver. For network coding with a single receiver, routing is known to achieve the capacity by achieving the network min-cut upper bound. We extend the definition of min-cut to the network computing problem and show that the min-cut is still an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate and is tight for computing (using coding) any target function in multi-edge tree networks. It is also tight for computing linear target functions in any network. We also study the bound's tightness for different classes of target functions. In particular, we give a lower bound on the computing capacity in terms of the Steiner tree packing number and a different bound for symmetric functions. We also show that for certain networks and target functions, the computing capacity can be less than an arbitrarily small fraction of the min-cut bound.","0018-9448","","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2095070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695137","Capacity;cut-set bound;function computation;information theory;network coding;throughput","","network coding","Sterner tree packing number;directed acyclic network;multi edge tree network;network coding;network computing;routing;symmetric function;target function","","21","","50","","","Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the emulator is constructed as a mobile agent, it can carry applications across networks on behalf of its target device and allow the applications to connect to local servers in its current network in the same way as if they had been moved with and executed on the device itself.

So, in ubiquitous computing, mere protection of message confidentiality is not sufficient for most of the applications where context-awareness can lead to near deterministic ideas. An adversary might deduce sensitive information by observing the contextual data, which when correlated with prior information about the people and the physical locations that are being monitored by a set of sensors can reveal most of the sensitive information. So, it is obvious that for security and privacy preservation in ubiquitous computing context protection is of equal importance. In this paper, we propose a scheme which provides two layer privacy protection of user's or application's context data. Our proposed context protecting privacy preservation scheme focuses on protecting spatial and temporal contextual information. We consider the communication part of ubiquitous computing consists of tiny sensor nodes forming Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Through simulation we show the efficacy of our scheme.

However, computational results from volunteered PCs have a non-negligible error rate, so result validation is needed to ensure overall correctness. A generally applicable technique is ""redundant computing"", in which each computation is done on several separate computers, and results are accepted only if there is a consensus. Variations in numerical processing between computers (due to a variety of hardware and software factors) can lead to different results for the same task. In some cases, this can be addressed by doing a ""fuzzy comparison"" of results, so that two results are considered equivalent if they agree within given tolerances. However, this approach is not applicable to applications that are ""divergent"", that is, for which small numerical differences can produce large differences in the results. In this paper we examine the problem of validating results of divergent applications. We present a novel approach called Homogeneous Redundancy (HR), in which the redundant instances of a computation are dispatched to numerically identical computers, allowing strict equality comparison of the results. HR has been deployed in Predictor@home, a world-wide community effort to predict protein structure from sequence.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419946","Heterogeneous Computing;Molecular Dynamics Simulations;Monte Carlo Simulations;Replication Techniques","Application software;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computational modeling;Computer errors;Computer science;Distributed computing;Hardware;Personal communication networks;Redundancy","Monte Carlo methods;biology computing;distributed processing;microcomputer applications;proteins;redundancy;replica techniques","distributed computing;homogeneous redundancy;molecular simulation;protein structure;public computing","","12","","23","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the reasons as identified include inability to afford the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of e-Commerce tools and applications, and lack of Information Communication Technology (ICT) expertise, amongst others. More so, in order to reduce TCO, SMMEs could pay for just the services and resources used per time (pay-as-you-use), without being burdened with high operational costs and overheads. This mode of resource delivery and utilization is often referred to as Utility Computing (UC) or on-Demand Computing (ODC). This paper reports an investigation of and profiles the relevant requirements and implementation guidelines to facilitate the design and implementation of an effective e-Commerce on-Demand service portal for a Grid Utility Computing (GUC) platform. A service portal prototype for the Grid-based Utility Infrastructure for Small, Micro, and Medium Enterprises Enabling Technology (GUISET) initiative - a Utility Computing platform, is being evolved with the aim of technologically enabling the business activities of these enterprises by facilitating an affordable access to relevant technologies on a pay-as-you-use basis. An analytic functional evaluation experiment was undertaken to determine if the minimum set of identified requirements considered necessary for the design of usable service portal for GUC platforms are satisfied and fulfilled in the portal prototype using a set of benchmark requirements. The result shows that these minimum requirements were satisfied and fulfilled by the service portal.","","","","10.1109/ICASTECH.2014.7068149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7068149","e-Commerce technology;grid-based service portal development;on-demand service portal requirements;utility computing","Business;Communities;Computer architecture;Economics;Portals;Prototypes;Subscriptions","cloud computing;electronic commerce;grid computing;portals;small-to-medium enterprises;utility programs","GUC platform;GUISET initiative;ICT;ODC;TCO;analytic functional evaluation;benchmark requirements;business activities;developing nations;e-commerce on-demand service portals;grid utility computing platform;grid-based utility infrastructure-for-small-micro-and-medium enterprise-enabling technology;information communication technology;large-scale organizations;on-demand computing;operational costs;overheads;pay-as-you-use;resource delivery mode;resource utilization mode;resource-constrained enterprises;rural areas;service portal prototype;technologically enabling resource-constrained enterprises;total cost-of-ownership","","0","","","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a challenge to increase the performance of a cluster computing system and reduce its power consumption simultaneously. MapReduce has recently evolved in data-intensive parallel computing. It is a programming model for processing large data sets. The implementation of MapReduce typically runs on a large scale of cluster computing systems consisting of thousands of commodity machines simply called MapReduce clusters that results in high power consumption, which is a major concern by service providers such as Amazon and Yahoo. In this research, we consider a collection of cluster computing resources owned by a service provider to host an enterprise application for business customers. We investigate the problem of resource allocation for power management in MapReduce clusters. Specifically, we propose resource allocation approaches to minimizing the mean end-to-end delay of customer jobs or services under the constraints of the energy consumption and the availability of MapReduce clusters and to minimizing the energy consumption of MapReduce clusters under the availability of MapReduce clusters and the mean end-to-end delay of customer jobs or services that play an essential role in the delivery of quality of services (QoS) for customer services..

Cloud computing users dynamically provision IT resources tracking their fluctuating demand, and only pay for their usage. Therefore, cloud computing essentially shifts the burden of capacity planning from user's side to provider's side. On the other hand, providers take this burden with the optimistic assumption that diverse workloads from various users will flatten the overall demand curve. However, this optimistic hypothesis has not been proved yet in the real world cases. In fact, counter evidences have been raised. December 2009, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading infrastructure cloud service provider, started to offer a real-time pricing for computing resources -- Amazon EC2 Spot Instances (SIs). Real-time pricing, in principle, encourages users to shift their flexible workloads from provider's peak hours to off-peak hours with monetary incentives. Interestingly, from our observation on AWS's one-year SI price history datasets, we conclude that the observed monetary incentive is not large enough to motivate users to shift their workloads. It is reasonable for users to choose SIs over on-demand instances because SIs are 52.3% cheaper on average. After that, shifting the workload to cheaper period provides only 3.7 % additional cost savings at best. Moreover, both average cost savings and price fluctuation have not been meaningfully changed over time.","","978-1-4577-0129-0","978-0-7695-4395-6","10.1109/CCGrid.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948651","Amazon Web Services;Cloud Computing;Infrastructure-as-a-service;Real-time Pricing;Spot Instance","Availability;Cloud computing;History;Pricing;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Silicon","Web services;capacity planning (manufacturing);cloud computing;information technology;pricing","Amazon EC2 spot instances;Amazon Web services;IT resource tracking;SI price history datasets;capacity planning;cloud computing;cloud service provider;cost savings;demand fluctuation;monetary incentive;optimistic hypothesis;real-time pricing","","10","","11","","","23-26 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thanks to the ubiquity of mobile computing devices and emerging cloud-based services, the users permanently stay connected to their data. This introduces a slew of new security challenges, including the problem of multi-device key management and single-sign-on architectures. One solution to this problem is the utilization of secure side-channels for authentication, including the visual channel as vicinity proof. However, existing approaches often assume confidentiality of the visual channel, or provide only insufficient means of mitigating a man-in-the-middle attack. In this work, we introduce QR-Auth, a two-step, 2D barcode based authentication scheme for mobile devices which aims specifically at key management and key sharing across devices in a pervasive environment. It requires minimal user interaction and therefore provides better usability than most existing schemes, without compromising its security. We show how our approach fits in existing authorization delegation and one-time-password generation schemes, and that it is resilient to man-in-the-middle attacks.","","978-1-4577-1455-9","","10.1109/BWCCA.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103036","2D barcode;authentication;key management;mobile;pervasive computing;smartphones;ubiquitous computing","Authentication;Authorization;Mobile communication;Protocols;Servers;Visualization","authorisation;bar codes;cloud computing;message authentication;mobile computing;mobile radio;public key cryptography;user interfaces","2D barcode based authentication scheme;QR-Auth;authorization delegation;cloud-based services;key sharing;man-in-the-middle attacks;mobile computing devices;mobile devices;multidevice key management;one-time-password generation schemes;pervasive computing environments;pervasive environment;secure side-channels;security challenges;single-sign-on architectures;user interaction;vicinity proof;visual channel;visual side channels","","0","","22","","","26-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ubiquitous Computing emphasizes the integration of computing and the environment, while the computer itself disappears from people's attention. In the ubiquitous computing model, people can access or even process information at any time or any place.

In our service, we can get various kinds of latest information (infotainment), extract their locations by location aware technology considering that there must be a related location in the information. The location-aware information is provided to users whenever they want. All the information sent to users has been filtered according to users' current locations and locations of the information. User can customize the categories of information to make sure he can get any preferred information but not only the navigation related ones, which makes users' travel more convenient and pleasant.

In cloud computing field, a service-provider offers large number of resources like computing units, storage space and software etc for customers with a relatively low cost. As the number of customer increases, fulfilling their requirements may become an important yet intractable matter. Resource allocation is therefore a primary issue considered restriction in resource amount that could be afforded by a company. The problem of resource allocation in cloud computing is thought to be a combinatorial optimization problem to a large company for numbers of their customers and owned resources could be huge enough. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed for this problem. The algorithm aims at finding out a desired task scheduler on resources based on multiple considerations including total task executing time, resource reservation, and QOS of each task. Pareto-domination mechanism is introduced into the algorithm helping searching multi-objective optimal solutions. Experimental results verify effectiveness and efficiency of the presented algorithm.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664566","cloud computing;pareto-dominate;particle swarm optimization;resource allocation","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Job shop scheduling;Particle swarm optimization;Processor scheduling;Resource management","Pareto optimisation;cloud computing;combinatorial mathematics;particle swarm optimisation;resource allocation;scheduling","IT revolution;Internet;Pareto domination mechanism;QOS;cloud computing field;combinatorial optimization problem;computer technology;customer requirements;multiobjective optimal solutions;multiobjective particle swarm optimization;resource allocation;resource reservation;service provider;task scheduler;total task executing time","","0","","10","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive security framework for grid computing environments. We also discuss challenges, existing solutions, approaches, and future work needed to provide a trustworthy grid computing environment. The demand of storage space is an issue for record digitalization. Mass storage and reliability of the Grid system do offer one solution for electronic records. In this paper we present a new method of storing electronic records distributed at different systems site using RAID-3 algorithm. By RAID-3, the segmented data stored at each system is meaningless and cannot be used alone.

The advantage of a circuit graph is that it can help us to obtain an intuitive understanding of the circuit under consideration, whereas the advantage of a Boolean expression is that it is suited to various algebraic manipulations. In the literature, however, quantum circuits are mainly drawn as circuit graphs, and a formal language for quantum circuits that has a function similar to that of Boolean expressions for classical circuits is still missing. Certainly, quantum circuit graphs will become unmanageable when complicated quantum computing problems are encountered, and in particular, when they have to be solved by employing the distributed paradigm where complex quantum communication networks are involved. In this paper, we design an algebraic language for formally specifying quantum circuits in distributed quantum computing. Using this language, quantum circuits can be represented in a convenient and compact way, similar to the way in which we use Boolean expressions in dealing with classical circuits. Moreover, some fundamental algebraic laws for quantum circuits expressed in this language are established.

Thus, fault tolerance for distributed object computing is obviously a significant research domain.

This specification defines how to achieve fault tolerance for distributed object computing using object group, and failure detection is one of the key elements for fault management. However, the specification does not depict much about failure detection and leaves many specific details to vendors. We propose a simple mechanism for failure detection in distributed object computing. This mechanism is designed to be general rather than application-specific, with no single point of failure, and efficient. While the failure detectors may also crash during operation, we propose a method to handle this condition and to ensure the ""no single point of failure"" feature.

Scientific applications usually require significant resources, however not all scientists have access to sufficient high-end computing systems. Cloud computing has gained the attention of scientists as a competitive resource to run HPC applications at a potentially lower cost. But as a different infrastructure, it is unclear whether clouds are capable of running scientific applications with a reasonable performance per money spent. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of EC2 cloud in different aspects. We first analyze the potentials of the cloud by evaluating the raw performance of different services of AWS such as compute, memory, network and I/O. Based on the findings on the raw performance, we then evaluate the performance of the scientific applications running in the cloud. Finally, we compare the performance of AWS with a private cloud, in order to find the root cause of its limitations while running scientific applications. This paper aims to assess the ability of the cloud to perform well, as well as to evaluate the cost of the cloud in terms of both raw performance and scientific applications performance. Furthermore, we evaluate other services including S3, EBS and DynamoDB among many AWS services in order to assess the abilities of those to be used by scientific applications and frameworks. We also evaluate a real scientific computing application through the Swift parallel scripting system at scale. Armed with both detailed benchmarks to gauge expected performance and a detailed monetary cost analysis, we expect this paper will be a recipe cookbook for scientists to help them decide where to deploy and run their scientific applications between public clouds, private clouds, or hybrid clouds","2168-7161","","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2404821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045591","Amazon AWS;Cloud computing;cloud costs;performance;scientific computing","Bandwidth;Benchmark testing;Cloud computing;Measurement;Scientific computing;Virtual machining;Virtualization","","","","0","","","","2015-02-19","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With advent of cloud computing technologies, firms are able to concentrate on their core activities while outsourcing the entire technology related supporting processes. This approach has been adopted by many firms which have resulted in lowering operational cost without losing focus on customer needs. However, the adoption has not been high among small and medium enterprises. This paper, through preliminary survey, finds out different situations for adopting cloud computing services. It was found that SMEs can benefit the most if they extend the adoption of cloud services for computation intensive jobs like data mining, modeling and simulation. The regular advantages for SMEs have been re-established such as lowering investment in hardware, more efficient use of computing systems in existing data centers, easier scale-up of the applications and services, cost saving on technology infrastructure and faster software upgrades without much expense. The results can be used by SMEs as decision point for adopting cloud services.","","978-1-4673-5325-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470904","SME;Small and medium enterprises;adoption of cloud computing;cloud computing","Computational modeling","cloud computing;cost reduction;small-to-medium enterprises","India;SME;cloud computing services;computation intensive jobs;computing systems;customer needs;data centers;data mining;decision points;investment;modeling;operational cost reduction;outsourcing;simulation;small and medium enterprises;software upgrades;technology infrastructure cost saving;technology related supporting processes","","0","","14","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, existing mechanisms and tools for policy management adopt different approaches for different types of policies. In this work, we propose a unified framework to facilitate collaborative policy analysis and management for different types of policies, focusing on policy anomaly detection and resolution.

These applications run on top of web-based, large, unreliable, and heterogeneous platforms, in which there is a high demand for autonomic behaviours, such as self-optimisation, self-adaptation, or self-healing. Chemistry-inspired computing consists in envisioning a computation as a succession of implicitly parallel, distributed and autonomous reactions, each reaction consuming molecules of data to produce new ones, until the state of inertia, where no more reactions are possible. This vision of a computation makes it a promising candidate to inject autonomic behaviours in service computing. However, while the benefits of such a model are manifold, its deployment over large scale platforms remains a widely open issue. In this paper, after identifying the main obstacles towards such a deployment, we propose a peer-to-peer framework able to execute chemical specifications at large scale. It combines distributed hash tables and algorithms for the atomic capture of molecules, and proposes an efficient method for inertia detection, which is a critical problem, in particular when addressed in a large scale environment. The sustainability of the framework is established through a complete complexity analysis.","","978-1-4673-0974-5","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270694","","Aggregates;Chemicals;Computational modeling;Data structures;Optimization;Runtime;Silicon","chemistry computing;distributed algorithms;fault tolerant computing;peer-to-peer computing;table lookup","atomic capture;autonomic behaviours;autonomic computing;autonomous reactions;autonomous services;chemical programming;chemical specifications;chemistry-inspired computing;complexity analysis;distributed algorithms;distributed hash tables;distributed reactions;framework sustainability;inertia detection;large scale environment;large scale platforms;parallel reactions;peer-to-peer framework;self-adaptation;self-healing;self-optimisation;service computing;temporal compositions","","0","","13","","","21-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike most existing studies on wireless networks, where only the spectrum efficiency is considered, we consider not only the spectrum efficiency in wireless networks but also the pricing information in the cloud, based on which power allocation and interference management in wireless networks are performed. We formulate the problems of cloud media service price decision, resource allocation and the interference management in the mobile cloud computing environment as a three-level Stackelberg game.

Dealing with ""single cloud"" providers is predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure and the possibility of malicious insiders in the single cloud. A movement towards ""multi-clouds"", or in other words, ""interclouds"" or ""cloud-of-clouds"" has emerged recently. This paper surveys recent research related to single and multi-cloud security and addresses possible solutions. It is found that the research into the use of multi-cloud providers to maintain security has received less attention from the research community than has the use of single clouds.

However, mobile devices have limited computing power and resources. An effective approach to remedying the problem is for mobile apps to subscribe cloud services, called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However, there exist two potential problems in MCC, low quality of service (QoS) and limited manageability. Managing MCC is challenging mainly due to performance degradation due to the network-based service invocations, dynamism caused by mobility, high heterogeneity on mobile platforms and services and the overhead for managing various elements of MCC which are highly distributed in nature. To provide a comprehensive and practical solution for MCC, in this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing process and its management-related methods. We first define an extended meta-model of MCC with self-stabilizing related elements. And, we define a main process for self-stabilization and a supplementary process of optimal clustering. We conduct experiments with the proposed process and methods, and the result shows that the self-stabilization and its methods are effective in stabilizing MCC in presence of QoS degradation and severe resource drains.","","978-1-4673-5659-6","","10.1109/SOSE.2013.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525562","Autonomous Management;Mobile Cloud Computing;QoS;Self-stabilization","Cloud computing;Ecosystems;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Quality of service;Servers","cloud computing;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio)","QoS degradation;cloud services;extended metamodel;limited computing power;mobile apps;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;mobile platform;mobility;network based service invocation;optimal clustering;performance degradation;self stabilization;self stabilizing process","","0","","25","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, scalability is hard to achieve, mainly due to the unknown nature of service consumers and unpredictable volumes of service invocations. Services with poor scalability would lose the consumer bases, resulting in low revenues. Conventional approaches to scalability of network, database, and distributed computing are hardware-oriented solutions. In this paper, we present software-oriented approaches to assuring high scalability of services in cloud computing. We first define scalability in service-oriented computing, present formal foundation of services scalability. Then, we present two effective scalability assuring schemes; service replication and migration. The proposed schemes are distinguished from conventional scalability schemes in three ways; tailored for service-oriented computing, software solutions rather than hardware solutions, and being implementable with current SOA and languages. To show the applicability of proposed schemes, we show a result of implementing the schemes and experiments with them. Using the methods, services scalability can be greatly enhanced dynamically by using software solutions.","","978-1-4244-8386-0","978-0-7695-4227-0","10.1109/ICEBE.2010.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704331","Cloud Computing;Migration;Scalability","Degradation;GSM;Measurement;Quality of service;Scalability;Software;Time factors","cloud computing;service-oriented architecture","SOA;cloud computing;high scalability assurance;service migration;service replication;service-oriented computing;software-oriented approach","","5","","14","","","10-12 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because clouds such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure offer large amounts of monetized co-located computation and storage well suited to typical processing tasks such as batch analytics. However, many Big Data applications rely on data that is geographically distributed, and is not collocated with the centralized computational resources provided by clouds. Examples of such applications include analysis of user data such as blogs, video feeds taken from geographically separated cameras, monitoring and log analysis of server and content distribution network (CDN) logs, and scientific data collected from distributed instruments and sensors. Such applications lead to a number of challenges for efficient data analytics in today's cloud platforms. First, in many applications, data is both large and widely distributed and data upload may constitute a non-trivial portion of the execution time. Second, centralized cloud resources present a single point of failure and network partitions between the data sources and the cloud can also lead to service disruptions. Third, the cost to transport, store, and process data may be outside of the budget of the small-scale application designer or end-user. The paper present Nebula: a dispersed edge cloud infrastructure that provides both computation and data storage to address the above challenges. The use of edge resources is attractive for several reasons. First, there is an increasing amount of computing and storage resources available on the edge, as evidenced by their use in several volunteer computing, filesharing as well as content delivery (CDN) environments. This capacity is likely to increase further with the provision of powerful multi-core, multi-node desktop and home machines coupled with increasing amount of high bandwidth Internet connectivity. Second, - dge resources provide locality to data and users naturally, and hence, can be exploited easily for insitu processing. Finally, if cost is an issue, then volunteer edge resources can be utilized at a relatively low cost.","","978-1-4799-5157-4","","10.1109/CTS.2014.6867613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6867613","","Cloud computing;Conferences;Distributed databases;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness","Big Data;cloud computing;distributed processing","Amazon AWS;Big Data applications;CDN logs;Microsoft Azure;Nebula infrastructure;batch analytics;centralized cloud resources;centralized clouds;centralized data-centers;computing resources;content distribution network;data-intensive computing;distributed edge cloud infrastructure;multicore multinode desktop;network partitions;storage resources;volunteer computing","","0","","","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, two specific realistic system scenarios are studied.

However, the resource constraints of ubiquitous computing systems make it difficult to satisfy timing requirements of supported strategies. In this paper, we study scheduling strategies for mobile data program with timing constraints in the form of deadlines. Unlike previously proposed scheduling algorithms for mobile systems which aim to minimize the mean access time, our goal is to identify scheduling algorithms for ubiquitous systems that ensure requests meet their deadlines. We present a study of the performance of traditional real-time strategies, and demonstrate that traditional real-time algorithms do not always perform the best in a mobile environment.We propose an efficient scheduling algorithm, called scheduling priority of mobile data with time constraint(SPMT), which is designed for timely delivery of data to mobile clients.","","978-1-4244-6708-2","","10.1109/UMEDIA.2010.5543942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543942","priority program;time constraint;ubiquitous computing","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Computer science;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Scheduling algorithm;Time factors;Timing;Transaction databases;Ubiquitous computing","constraint handling;database management systems;mobile computing;real-time systems;scheduling","mobile data management;mobile data program;mobile service;real-time database management model;scheduling algorithm;time constraint;ubiquitous computing environment","","0","","15","","","5-6 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CCGRID '09. 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20090612","2009","","","84","91","Green computing is a new paradigm of designing the computer system which considers not only the processing performance but also the energy efficiency. Power management is one of the approaches in green computing to reduce the power consumption in distributed computing system. In this paper, we first propose an optimal power management (OPM) used by a batch scheduler in a server farm. This OPM observes the state of a server farm and makes the decision to switch the operation mode (i.e., active or sleep) of the server to minimize the power consumption while the performance requirements are met. An optimization problem based on constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) is formulated and solved to obtain an optimal decision of OPM. Given that OPM is used in the server farm, then an assignment of users to the server farms by a job broker is considered. This assignment is to ensure that the cost due to power consumption and network transportation is minimized. The performance of the system is extensively evaluated. The result shows that with OPM the job waiting time can be maintained below the maximum threshold while the power consumption is much smaller than that without OPM.","","978-1-4244-3935-5","978-0-7695-3622-4","10.1109/CCGRID.2009.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071858","Green computing;Markov decision process;optimal power management","Constraint optimization;Costs;Distributed computing;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Energy management;Network servers;Power system management;Processor scheduling;Switches","Markov processes;distributed processing;power aware computing","constrained Markov decision process;distributed computing;green computing;optimal power management;power consumption;server farm","","11","","17","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By the end of this period, most of these programs at NSF had been disbanded, and the foundation was concentrating its support for computing not on the service of other scientific disciplines, but instead on the establishment of a theoretically oriented discipline of computer science. The primary focus here is on NSF institutional history with only a few examples of the impact of NSF programs.

To support MLS distributed computing, a MLS infrastructure must be built that enables information sharing among users at different classification levels. This infrastructure should provide MLS services for protection of classified information and use both the emerging distributed computing and commercial security infrastructures, when possible. The resulting infrastructure will enable users to integrate commercial information technology products into their systems.

Over more than two years, we have collected power data from 250+ individual computing devices and have monitored a subset of CPU and network loads. This dense, long-term monitoring allows us to extrapolate the data to a detailed breakdown of electricity use across the building's computing systems. Our datasets provide an opportunity to examine assumptions commonly made in green computing. We show that power variability both between similar devices and over time for a single device can lead to cost or savings estimates that are off by 15-20%. Extending the coverage of measured devices and the duration (to at least one month) significantly reduces errors. Lastly, our experiences with collecting data and the subsequent analysis lead to a better understanding of how one should go about power characterization studies.

In this paper, we identify three essential objectives for a commercial computing service: (i) meet SLA, (ii) maintain reliability, and (iii) earn profit. This leads to the problem of whether a resource management policy implemented in the commercial computing service is able to meet the required objectives or not. So, we also develop two evaluation methods that are simple and intuitive: (i) separate and (ii) integrated risk analysis to analyze the effectiveness of resource management policies in achieving the required objectives. Evaluation results based on five policies successfully demonstrate the applicability of separate and integrated risk analysis to assess policies in terms of the required objectives.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4227969","","Computer science;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Investments;Laboratories;Maintenance;Resource management;Risk analysis;Software engineering;Switches","resource allocation;risk analysis;utility programs","commercial utility computing service;integrated risk analysis;resource management policy;service level agreement","","4","","28","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The task of computing separable functions, which can be written as linear combinations of functions of individual variables, is studied in this context. Known iterative algorithms for averaging can be used to compute the normalized values of such functions, but these algorithms do not extend, in general, to the computation of the actual values of separable functions. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a distributed randomized algorithm for computing separable functions. The running time of the algorithm is shown to depend on the running time of a minimum computation algorithm used as a subroutine. Using a randomized gossip mechanism for minimum computation as the subroutine yields a complete fully distributed algorithm for computing separable functions. For a class of graphs with small spectral gap, such as grid graphs, the time used by the algorithm to compute averages is of a smaller order than the time required by a known iterative averaging scheme.","0018-9448","","","10.1109/TIT.2008.924648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544980","Data aggregation;distributed algorithms;gossip algorithms;randomized algorithms","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Distributed algorithms;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Iterative algorithms;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protocols","graph theory;grid computing;iterative methods;random processes","ad hoc networks;computing functions;distributed randomized algorithm;grid graphs;iterative algorithms;iterative averaging scheme;minimum computation algorithm;peer-to-peer networks;randomized gossip mechanism;sensor networks","","37","","26","","","July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such technical improvements give birth to a demand for running sophisticated applications over multiple mobile devices. Since more than one process executes concurrently in this computing environment and they have to send application data to each other, any failure on a process or a network connection may result in serious problems. Against such failure on distributed applications, many algorithms are devised. In this paper we also devise a new distributed checkpointing scheme very suitable for the mobile distributed applications. For our checkpointing scheme, we propose two key ideas of a checkpoint-related software agent, called checkpointing agent (CA), and a flexible checkpointing protocol. The CA is used to make consistent global checkpoints on behalf of application processes. Since the CA's communicate with each other via wired fixed networks, we can reduce network overheads paid for delivering checkpoint-related data via wirelesses networks.","","978-1-4244-4566-0","978-1-4244-4568-4","10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5174610","","Application software;Checkpointing;Computer networks;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Costs;Distributed computing;Mobile computing;Protocols;Wireless networks","checkpointing;mobile computing;protocols;software agents","checkpoint-related software agent;checkpointing agent;computing environment;distributed checkpointing scheme;mobile computing environment;wired fixed networks","","0","","14","","","13-17 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bricks can simulate various behaviors of global computing systems, especially the behavior of networks and resource scheduling algorithms. Moreover, Bricks is partitioned into components such that not only can its constituents be replaced to simulate various different system algorithms, but it also allows the incorporation of existing global computing components via its foreign interface. To test the validity of the latter characteristics, we incorporated the NWS (Network Weather Service) system, which monitors and forecasts global computing systems behavior. Experiments were conducted by running NWS under a real environment versus a Bricks-simulated environment, given the observed parameters of the real environment.

Changing the behavior of a computing system may benefit a wide variety of fields, raging from the embedded world (e.g., smart phones) to the supercomputers world (e.g., clusters) and is particularly useful for meeting performance, power consumption, and resource consumption challenges. With this paper we show the impact of using self-aware adaptive applications running on heterogeneous computing systems featuring diverse processing units. The operating system will answer requests for functionalities by choosing at runtime the best suiting implementations. During the applications lifetime, their performances are monitored and, if necessary, active implementations are changed using a hot-swap mechanism.

A methodology of development for secure mobile Grid computing based systems is defined, that is to say, an engineering process that defines the steps to follow so that starting from the necessities to solve, we can design and construct a secure Grid system with support for mobile devices that is able to solve and cover these necessities.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529331","Grid Computing;Mobile computing;Security;development process","Application software;Availability;Grid computing;Information security;Information systems;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Portable computers;Research and development;Wireless networks","formal specification;grid computing;mobile computing;security of data","formal approach;mobile devices;secure mobile grid computing based system;software development;software life cycle","","1","","22","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our main contributions are i) introduction of newly implemented STMD in LAMMPS, ii) use of large scale distributed cyber infrastructure including Amazon EC2 and the nationwide distributed computing infrastructure GENI, in addition to High-performance Computing (HPC) cluster systems, and iii) benchmark and simulation results highlighting advantages and potentials of STMD and RESTMD for challenging large-scale bio molecular conformational search. In this work, we attempt to provide convincing evidence that RESTMD, combining two advanced sampling protocols, STMD and the replica exchange algorithm, offers various advantages over not only conventional ineffective approaches but also other enhanced sampling methods. Interestingly, RESTMD has benefits over the most popular Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) as an application maximizing its capacity in HPC environments. For example, RESTMD alleviates the need of a large number of replicas which is unavoidable in REMD and is flexible in order to exploit the maximum amount of available computing power of a cluster system. Continuing our recent effort in which RESTMD was implemented with a community molecular dynamics package, CHARMM, and the Hadoop MapReduce, in this work, we report latest development outcomes. First of all, we plugged the implementation of STMD into LAMMPS, one of the most popular public molecular dynamics packages. This is expected to position STMD and RESTMD appealing to investigators from a broad range of life science fields. Secondly, Hadoop MapReduce-based RESTMD is now able to run on Amazon EC2 and the nationwide network virtual organization, the GENI distributed computing environment. Thirdly, in order to find optimized parameters for RESTMD simulations, simulation re- ults using test systems, water and solvated cram bin, were obtained and presented. These results, despite of relatively small sizes and short time scale trajectories, serve to underscore merits and potentials of STMD and RESTMD with respect to the strength in algorithmic advantages as well as efficient utilization of distributed resources.","","978-1-4799-1774-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2015.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096148","Hadoop MapReduce;LAMMPS;RESTMD;enhanced conformational sampling","Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Histograms;Scalability;Temperature distribution","bioinformatics;cloud computing;data handling;molecular biophysics;molecular dynamics method;parallel processing;sampling methods","Amazon EC2;CHARMM;GENI distributed computing environment;HPC cluster systems;Hadoop MapReduce-based RESTMD;LAMMPS;RESTMD;advanced sampling protocol;cloud computing resources;distributed computing infrastructure;distributed cyber infrastructure;high-performance computing cluster systems;large-scale biomolecular conformation search;nationwide network virtual organization;parallel tempering version;public molecular dynamics packages;replica exchange algorithm;replica exchange statistical temperature molecular dynamics","","0","","","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For continued sustainable progress, GPU computing at scale also need to address two open issues: a) how increase applications mean time between failures (MTBF) as we increase supercomputer's component counts, and b) how to minimize unnecessary energy consumption. Since energy consumption is defined by the number of components used, we consider a sustainable high performance computing (HPC) application can allow better performance and reliability at the same time when adding computing or communication components. This paper reports a two-tier semantic statistical multiplexing framework for sustainable HPC at scale. The idea is to leverage the powers of statistic multiplexing to tame the nagging HPC scalability challenges. We include the theoretical model, sustainability analysis and computational experiments with automatic system level multiple CPU/GPU failure containment. Our results show that assuming three times slowdown of the statistical multiplexing layer, for an application using 1024 processors with 35% checkpoint overhead, the two-tier framework will produce sustained time and energy savings for MTBF less than 6 hours. With 5% checkpoint overhead, 1.5 hour MTBF would be the break even point. These results suggest the practical feasibility for the proposed two-tier framework.","","978-1-4577-0974-6","","10.1109/CSE.2011.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062884","Data parallel processing;Fault tolerant GPU computing;Semantic statistical multiplexing;Tuple switching network","Graphics processing unit;Multiplexing;Parallel processing;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Semantics;Switches","computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;parallel machines;statistical multiplexing","automatic system level multiple CPU failure containment;automatic system level multiple GPU failure containment;energy consumption;general purpose GPU computing;mean time between failures;statistical multiplexing layer;supercomputers;sustainability analysis;sustainable GPU computing;sustainable high performance computing application;two-tier semantic statistical multiplexing framework","","2","","34","","","24-26 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then look at the recent impact of new technologies on individual and group student learning. We take a strong position that we now have new topologies for learning which have no direct analogues in past educational practice. These positive educational developments are occurring because of relatively cheap access to almost ubiquitous computing and because of the maturity of a range of artificial intelligence derived search and indexing mechanisms that are now easy to use. We consider the barriers to effective deployment of these new approaches by educational institutions, paying particular attention to the need to devise new approaches to formative and summative assessment.","","0-7695-2916-X","","10.1109/ICALT.2007.193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4280937","","Computer science education;Educational technology;Information services;Internet;Learning;Psychology;Taxonomy;Topology;Ubiquitous computing;Web sites","educational technology;personal computing;social sciences computing","artificial intelligence;educational technology;interactive computing facilities;personal computing;social computing;ubiquitous computing","","0","","10","","","18-20 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system, Cluster Computing on the Fly, seeks to harvest cycles from ordinary users in an open access, non-institutional environment. We conduct a comprehensive study of generic searching methods in a highly dynamic peer-to-peer environment for locating idle cycles for workpile applications which are heavy consumers of cycles. We compare four scalable search methods: expanding ring, advertisement-based, random walk and rendezvous point. We model a variety of workloads, simple scheduling strategies and stabilities of hosts. Our preliminary results show that under light workloads, rendezvous point performs best, while under heavy workloads, its performance falls below the other techniques. We expected rendezvous point to consistently outperform the other search techniques because of its inherent advantage in gathering knowledge about the idle cycles. However in a peer-to-peer environment, which satisfies requests on-demand, large jobs may dominate, resulting in delays for scheduling smaller jobs.","","0-7803-8430-X","","10.1109/CCGrid.2004.1336550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336550","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Convergence;Grid computing;IP networks;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Scheduling","Internet;client-server systems;performance evaluation;query formulation;resource allocation;scheduling;workstation clusters","Cluster Computing on the Fly;Internet;advertisement-based search;cycle sharing peer-to-peer system;distributed computing;dynamic peer-to-peer environment;expanding ring search;generic searching methods;host stability;idle cycle location;open access environment;peer-to-peer computing;performance;random walk search;rendezvous point search;resource discovery;scalable search methods;scheduling strategies;workpile applications","","7","","24","","","19-22 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, trends in development of services computing are taking into account new high-level interaction models founded on services composition. These services make up their functionalities with the objective of creating smart spaces in which services with different purposes can collaborate to offer new and more complex functionalities to the user transparently. This leads to the creation of collaborative spaces with value-added services derived from the composition of existing ones. However, there are many aspects to consider during the development of this type of systems in pervasive spaces, in which the extensive use of embedded devices with limited characteristics of mobility, computing resources and memory, is a large handicap. This paper describes a model of services composition based on a directed acyclic graph used in a services middleware for home-automation, in which we work with loosely coupled services-oriented systems over the peer-to-peer technology JXTA. The presented composition model guarantee the acyclicity of the composition map between services as well as favours the building of collaborative light services using peers as proactive entities, which could be executed on embedded devices. These ones are capable of establishing dynamic intercommunications, synchronizing with others and form coalitions to cooperate between theirs for a common purpose.","","978-1-4577-0041-5","978-83-60810-35-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6078231","","Collaboration;Hardware;Java;Peer to peer computing;Pervasive computing;Service oriented architecture","directed graphs;groupware;home automation;middleware;peer-to-peer computing;service-oriented architecture;ubiquitous computing","JXTA technology;collaborative mechanism;collaborative space;directed acyclic graph;home automation;peer-to-peer pervasive computing;service composition model;service middleware;service-oriented architecture;services computing;value-added services","","1","","20","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DAG defines the data flow of a program, vertices represent operations applied to the data. The data which are streaming through the graph are expressed as key/value pairs. ESC allows programmers to focus on the problem at hand and deals with distribution and fault tolerance. Furthermore, it is able to adapt to changing computational demands. In the cloud, ESC can dynamically attach and release machines to adjust the computational capacities to the current needs. This is crucial for stream computing since the amount of data fed into the system is not under the platform's control.

The growth and popularity of cloud-virtualized resources (infrastructure, platform and software), have been accompanied with an increase in cloud performance evaluation that could be used for decision-making. As reported in the literature, most of the evaluations and simulations tend to be one dimensional that focus on easily measurable criteria such as load balancing and response time. This paper presents a more holistic approach using the technique of balanced scorecard that analyses cloud computing with respect to finance, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth perspectives. A critical analysis shows that cost reduction is not enough to cause a customer to embrace cloud computing. Other factors such as value proposition, internal and growth perspectives also play a role.","","","","10.1109/GOCICT.2014.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113657","Cloud computing;balanced scorecard;customer;financial perspective;internal processes;learning and growth perspective","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Engines;Google;Monitoring;Organizations","Internet of Things;cloud computing","Internet of Things;Internet technologies;IoT;balanced scorecard approach;cloud computing;cloud performance evaluation;cloud virtualized resources;decision-making;holistic approach;performance analysis","","0","","","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use accelerometer-based tracking to reduce the effort we need to collect Wi-Fi signals and save battery power consumption effectively. With the help of short-range search, the goal recognition module is enhanced, compared to previous ldquolocationonlyrdquo approaches. Therefore, we could augment our mobile devices by automatically analyzing our needs and connecting to corresponding devices.

In this paper, we explore the application of probabilistic computing for low power motion estimation. It is observed that motion estimation itself exhibits high resilience to erroneous computation. Simulations show that energy savings up to 44% can be achieved in motion estimation using full search block matching with probabilistic computing with a minor impact (under 0.5 dB) on the required quality of the output. A scheme of error correction based on the motion vector distribution is proposed that further increases the possible energy savings with full search block matching up to 57%.","2159-3469","978-1-4577-0803-9","978-0-7695-4447-2","10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992501","PCMOS architecture;error resilient design;low power design;motion estimation;probabilistic computing","Arrays;Error correction;Logic gates;Motion estimation;Probabilistic logic;Video sequences","error correction;motion estimation","Moore law;block matching;energy efficient computing;erroneous computation;error correction;full search block matching;low nanometer range;low power motion estimation;motion vector distribution;probabilistic computing;signal processing application;thermal noise","","4","","22","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a focus on vendor lock-in.

However, guaranteeing or even predicting QoS in global and diverse networks supporting complex hosting of application services is a very challenging issue that needs a stepwise refinement approach to be solved as the technology of cloud computing matures. In this paper, we investigate if latency in terms of simple Ping measurements can be used as an indicator for other QoS parameters such as jitter and throughput. The experiments were carried out on a global scale, between servers placed in universities in Denmark, Poland, Brazil and Malaysia. The results show some correlation between latency and throughput, and between latency and jitter, even though the results are not completely consistent. As a side result, we were able to monitor the changes in QoS parameters during a number of 24-hour periods.

As cloud computing adoption increases, the energy consumption of the network and of the computing resources that underpin the cloud is growing and causing the emission of enormous quantities of CO<sub>2</sub>. Research is now focusing on novel ""low-carbon"" cloud-computing solutions. Renewable energy sources are emerging as a promising solution both to achieve drastic reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and to cope with the growing power requirements of data centers. These infrastructures can be located near renewable energy plants and data can be effectively transferred to these locations via reconfigurable optical networks, based on the principle that data can be moved more efficiently than electricity. This paper focuses on how to dynamically route on-demand optical circuits that are established to transfer energy-intensive data processing towards data centers powered with renewable energy. Our main contribution consists in devising two routing algorithms for connections supporting CC services, aimed at minimizing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of data centers by following the current availability of renewable energies (e.g., coming from sun and wind). The trade-off with energy consumption for the transport equipments is considered. We also compare three different IP-over-WDM network architectures. The results show that relevant reductions, up to about 30% in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be achieved using our approaches compared to baseline shortest-path-based routing strategies, paying off only a marginal increase in terms of network blocking probability.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689481","IP-over-WDM network;green routing;inter-datacenter network;renewable energy","Air pollution;Energy consumption;Green products;IP networks;Power demand;Renewable energy sources;Routing","air pollution control;cloud computing;computer centres;optical fibre networks;renewable energy sources;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;wavelength division multiplexing","CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction;IP over WDM network;baseline shortest path based routing strategy;cloud computing service;conventional office based computing;data centers;energy consumption;energy intensive data processing;low carbon cloud computing solution;low emissions routing;network blocking probability;on-demand optical circuit;reconfigurable optical network;renewable energy plant;renewable energy sources;routing algorithm","","2","","","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our comparative study performs deployment of example applications of network-based libraries using Ninf, NetSolve, and CORBA systems. There, we discover that dedicated systems for global computing such as Ninf and NetSolve have management, programmability, and it does not suffer performance disadvantages over more generic distributed computing capabilities provided by CORBA.

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software failures. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloudwide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in production clouds, especially for newly managed or deployed systems. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. It employs data description using hypersphere for adaptive failure detection. Based on the cloud performance data, AAD detects possible failures, which are verified by the cloud operators. They are confirmed as either true failures with failure types or normal states. The algorithm adapts itself by recursively learning from these newly verified detection results to refine future detections. Meanwhile, it exploits the observed but undetected failure records reported by the cloud operators to identify new types of failures. We have implemented a prototype of the algorithm and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment. Our experimental results show that AAD can achieve more efficient and accurate failure detection than other existing scheme.","1060-9857","978-1-4673-2397-0","","10.1109/SRDS.2012.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424881","Autonomic management;Cloud computing;Dependable systems;Failure detection;Learning algorithms","Cloud computing;Detectors;Equations;Kernel;Sensitivity;Support vector machines","cloud computing;data acquisition;failure analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);recursive functions;security of data;software fault tolerance","AAD;adaptive anomaly detection system;adaptive failure detection;autonomic failure detection;cloud computing infrastructure;cloud execution monitoring;cloud operator;complex computing infrastructure maintenance;hardware failure;recursive learning;runtime performance data collection;runtime problem;self-managing cloud resource;software failure;system level dependability assurance","","5","","5","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It analyzes a program at the opcode and control flow levels, and compares this to a machine's capability to support the unique characteristics of the program. In this paper we develop the suitability measure and a series of program analysis methods. Experimental results confirm that machines that provide a better match to the program yield a higher suitability score. We prove that loops provide the only contribution to the suitability value, and also that the number of loop iterations is irrelevant, leading to the conclusion that a single pass through a loop is sufficient to derive a suitability value.","","0-7695-2917","","10.1109/ISPDC.2007.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271923","DAG;Efficiency;control flow graph;cycles;irregularity;opcode","Cooling;Embedded computing;Flow graphs;Optical computing;Particle measurements;Performance analysis;Physical optics;Physics computing;Resource management;Runtime","aerospace computing;program control structures;program diagnostics","loop iteration;opcode;optimal computing platform selection;program analysis;spaceborne computing platform selection;suitability measure","","0","","10","","","5-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The EU represents an attractive environment for Exascale Cloud Computing, due to its well-established IP infrastructure with relatively low edge distances. An Exascale Cloud Computing system linking hundreds of data-centers can interconnect potentially millions of servers, considerably larger than the world's most powerful supercomputer. However, the US Dept. of Energy has recently concluded that cloud computing is too expensive and suitable only for scientific applications with minimal communications requirements. This paper explores a Future-Internet network to address these concerns. The network combines several technologies; (i) a QoS-aware router scheduling algorithm, (ii) a flow resource-reservation signalling algorithm, and (iii) flow aggregation, to establish highly-efficient guaranteed-rate connections between data-centers. A Maximum-Flow Minimum-Energy routing algorithm is used to route high-capacity ”trunks” between data-centers with minimum energy requirements. The traffic flows between data-centers are aggregated onto the trunks, to achieve exceptionally low latencies with improved link utilizations and energy-efficiencies. The high packet loss rates and large queueing delays of traditional Best-Effort Internet are eliminated, and the latency over the cloud is reduced to the fiber latency. The average fiber latencies over the Nobel-EU network are a few milliseconds, and they can be mitigated with multithreading. The bisection bandwidth of the cloud can be improved to match the demand by activating dark fiber. By lowering latencies, the utilization of the Internet data-centers will also increase, further improving overall energy efficiency. The proposed Future Internet network can improve the utilization and energy efficiency of both the communications and computations in Cloud Computing systems.","1555-5798","","","10.1109/PACRIM.2013.6625455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625455","Internet;QoS;cloud computing;data-centers;energy efficiency;exas-cale;low latency;maximum flow;minimum energy;minimum latency;quality of service;routing","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Delays;IP networks;Quality of service;Routing","IP networks;Internet;cloud computing;computer centres;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication signalling","European Union;ExaScale cloud computing systems;IP back- bone network;IP infrastructure;Nobel-EU;QoS-aware router scheduling algorithm;data-centers;flow resource-reservation signalling algorithm;future Internet network;maximum flow minimum energy routing;supercomputer","","0","","16","","","27-29 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For inherently spatial problems, it can be more effective to store spatially relevant information in the environment rather than in the computing devices, as in the case of mobile agents or long-term physical structures. In scientific settings, considering the role of the environment can illuminate mechanisms or processes that might otherwise be overlooked; in engineering problems, it can provide simpler and more effective solutions than could be achieved by relying on the computing devices alone. We give as examples problems related to foraging, collective construction, simultaneous localization and mapping, object tracking, and behaviors of living tissues.

However, resource allocation in cloud computing is a multi-constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The computational complexity for an exhaustive search over all combinations of resource allocations is too high for practical implementation. In this paper, we develop a Modified Elite Chaotic Immune Clonal Selection Algorithm to increase the overall efficiency of the system.

During the scheduling of such scientific applications for execution, various computation data flows will happen between the controller and computing server instances. Amongst various quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, data security is one of the greatest concerns to scientists because their data may be intercepted or stolen by malicious parties during those data flows. An existing typical method for addressing this issue is to apply Internet Key Exchange (IKE) scheme to generate and exchange session keys, and then to apply these keys for performing symmetric-key encryption which will encrypt those data flows. However, the IKE scheme suffers from low efficiency due to its low performance of asymmetric-key crypto logical operations over a large amount of data and high-density operations which are exactly the characteristics of scientific applications. In this paper, we propose Cloud Computing Background Key Exchange (CCBKE), a novel authenticated key exchange scheme that aims at efficient security-aware scheduling of scientific applications. Our scheme is designed based on randomness-reuse strategy and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) scheme. Theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the IKE scheme, our CCBKE scheme can significantly improve the efficiency by dramatically reducing time consumption and computation load without sacrificing the level of security.","","978-1-4673-0006-3","","10.1109/DASC.2011.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6118759","authenticated key exchange;cloud computing;communication security;efficiency","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Encryption;Materials;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;message authentication;quality of service","CCBKE;IKE scheme;Internet key exchange;QoS metrics;asymmetric-key crypto logical operation;authenticated key exchange scheme;cloud computing background key exchange;data security;data-intensive scientific application;quality-of-service;randomness-reuse strategy;security-aware scheduling;symmetric-key encryption","","1","","26","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system is commonly used for video surveillance, human and computer interaction, robot navigation, and etc. Along with the utilization of the system, it leads to the need for a faster system response, such as robot navigation or application for public safety. A number of classification algorithms have been applied to face recognition system, but it still has a problem in terms of computing time. In this system, computing time of the classification or feature extraction is an important thing for further concern. Classification algorithm that is suitable for very large databases and efficient in time complexity is WaveCluster. WaveCluster based on wavelet transform able to analyze function at different resolution. To enhance system ability as a real-time system, WaveCluster will be present to be parallel process and implemented on GPU using CUDA. CUDA is a parallel computing architecture that can manage high-performance parallel computing on GPU with large memory bandwidth. The parallelization of WaveCluster algorithm on GPU using CUDA is expected to speed-up the process computing time compared to serial process on CPU.

The benefit of such systems with self-x properties is that they are more dependable, as they can compensate for some failures. They are easier to maintain, because they can automatically configure themselves and are more convenient to use because of automatic adaptation to new situations. While organic computing systems have a lot of desired properties, there still exists only little knowledge on how they can be designed and built.In this paper an approach for specification and construction of a class of organic computing systems is presented, called the (RIA). The core idea is that the behaviour of an organic computing system can be split into productive phases and self-x phases. This allows for a generic description of how ``organic'' aspects can be specified and implemented. The approach will be illustrated by applying it to a design methodology for organic computing systems and further refining it to an explicit case study in the domain of production automation.","","978-0-7695-3404-6","","10.1109/SASO.2008.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663427","autonomic computing;fomral methods;organic computing;safety critical systems","Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Data acquisition;Design automation;Design methodology;Lighting control;Production systems;Refining;Relays;Safety","formal specification;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance","autonomic computing;construction paradigm;formal methods;organic computing systems;safety critical systems;specification paradigm","","10","","24","","","20-24 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to discussing the architecture and protocols to facilitate this capability, the authors also provide a taxonomy for describing a variety of different session handoff schemes. In particular, they have identified an important Two-Way Interactive Session Transfer (TWIST) behaviour for communication between heterogeneous clients and servers.

A common problem arising in grid computing is to select the most efficient resource to run a particular program. Also users are required to reserve in advance the resources needed to run their program on the grid. At present the execution time of any program submission depends on guesswork by the user. This leads to inefficient use of resources, incurring extra operation costs such as idling queues or machines. Thus a prediction module was designed and developed to aid the user. This module estimates the execution time of a program by using aspects of static analysis, analytical benchmarking and compiler based approach. It consists of 4 main stages; each with its own functionality. An incoming program is categorized accordingly, parsed and then broken down into smaller units known as tokens. The complexity and relationship amongst these tokens are then analyzed and finally the execution time is estimated for the entire program that was submitted.","","978-1-4244-1691-2","978-1-4244-1692-9","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580733","","Application software;Availability;Data engineering;Distributed computing;Environmental management;Grid computing;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Processor scheduling;Resource management","grid computing;program compilers;program diagnostics;scheduling","analytical benchmarking;compiler based approach;distributed computational resources;execution time;grid computing environment;heterogeneous computing;optimize scheduling;prediction module;static analysis","","1","","11","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The feature provides economic benefits to both users and service providers since it reduces the management cost and thus lowers the subscription price. Many users are, however, reluctant to subscribe to cloud computing services due to security concerns. To advance deployment of cloud computing, techniques enabling secure multitenancy, especially resource isolation techniques, need to be advanced further. Difficulty lies in the fact that the techniques range and cross various technical domains, and it is difficult to get the big picture. To cope with that, this paper introduces technical layers and categories, with which it identifies and structures technical issues on enabling multitenancy by conducting a survey. Based on the survey result, this paper discusses technical maturity of multitenant cloud computing from the standpoint of security and the needs for developing both technical and operational security toward the development and wide deployment of multitenant cloud computing.","","978-1-4673-1672-9","","10.1109/BCFIC.2012.6217983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217983","Multitenancy;cloud computing;resource isolation;security","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Hardware;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;security of data","cloud computing;economic benefits;multitenancy security;multitenant feature;service providers;subscription price;user providers","","3","","67","","","25-27 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This P2P technology is started from file sharing, video streaming and P2P computing. Basically in this P2P computing, those who are in on-line all will act likes as a server or client. If they are having data segments then it will act as server otherwise clients. Generally the data segments are preserving at the peers in different levels such as hard cache and soft cache. Based on the popularity the video contents can be downloaded. Normally the most popular data segments are placed on the cache which is downloaded either from video server of from neighboring peers. There are so many of cache replacement algorithms have been introduced to replace the old data segments with newly arrived data segments. While arriving new data segments the old data segments removed from the queue i.e. cache, so the availability of the data content is presented very low. To overcome this problem multilevel cache is protecting the old segments in order to increase the speed. Generally P2P system the request will go at the neighbouring peer that particular neighbouring peer having is less connectivity then the client can receive the data segments slowly. Therefore overcoming this category of connectivity problem, we recommended bandwidth based cluster. After client registration, the video server build cluster based on bandwidth size. Once the request from client / server received immediately the video server finds highest bandwidth and LFU peer in their cluster and then service is redirected. The NS2 simulator result shows that constant bit rate video deliver is acceptable End-to-End Transmission Delay, which is autonomous on the Constant bit rate and autonomous on the connection rate.","","978-1-4799-3139-2","","10.1109/ICSPCT.2014.6884982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6884982","Clustering;P2P computing;bandwidth based cluster;distributed computing;multilevel cache","Abstracts;Clustering algorithms;Delays;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Peer-to-peer computing;Servers;US Department of Defense","cache storage;client-server systems;peer-to-peer computing;storage management;video on demand;video servers;video streaming","LFU peer;NS2 simulator;P2P computing technology;bandwidth based cluster;bandwidth size;cache replacement algorithms;client registration;client-server;constant bit rate video delivery;data segments;end-to-end transmission delay;file sharing;hard cache;multilevel cache;neighbouring peer;peer-to-peer computing;soft cache;video content management;video server;video streaming","","0","","8","","","12-13 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This will reduce the required power and time for completing such intensive jobs. However, connecting mobile devices with the cloud suffers from the high network latency and the huge transmission power consumption especially when using 3G/LTE connections. In this paper, we introduce a Cloudlet based MCC system aiming to reduce the power consumption and the network delay while using MCC. We merged the MCC concepts with the proposed Cloudlet framework and propose a new framework for the MCC model.

Some of the existing Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS) explore parallelism techniques - such as parameter sweep and data fragmentation. In those systems, several computing resources are used to accomplish many computational tasks in homogeneous environments, such as multiprocessor machines or cluster systems. Cloud computing has become a popular high performance computing model in which (virtualized) resources are provided as services over the Web. Some scientists are starting to adopt the cloud model in scientific domains and are moving their scientific workflows (programs and data) from local environments to the cloud. Nevertheless, it is still difficult for the scientist to express a parallel computing paradigm for the workflow on the cloud. Capturing distributed provenance data at the cloud is also an issue. Existing approaches for executing scientific workflows using parallel processing are mainly focused on homogeneous environments whereas, in the cloud, the scientist has to manage new aspects such as initialization of virtualized instances, scheduling over different cloud environments, impact of data transferring and management of instance images. In this paper we propose SciCumulus, a cloud middleware that explores parameter sweep and data fragmentation parallelism in scientific workflow activities (with provenance support). It works between the SWfMS and the cloud. SciCumulus is designed considering cloud specificities. We have evaluated our approach by executing simulated experiments to analyze the overhead imposed by clouds on the workflow execution time.","","978-1-4244-8207-8","978-0-7695-4130-3","10.1109/CLOUD.2010.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557969","Cloud Computing;Many Task Computing (MTC);Middleware;Scientific Workflows","Clouds;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data models;Distributed databases;Middleware;Parallel processing","Internet;middleware;parallel processing;task analysis;workflow management software","SciCumulus;Web;cloud computing;lightweight cloud middleware;parallel processing;scientific workflow management systems;task computing paradigm","","19","","24","","","5-10 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, harnessing sensitive data collected by ubiquitous computing infrastructures for traceability applications in a privacy-respecting manner may clearly bring further benefits, for different concerned parties. Automated working hours recording and personalized insurances are first examples of such applications.

However when hundreds or thousands of femtocells operate together the total power consumption of the mobile network increases considerably. Mobile cloud computing is a technology that reduces the power consumption of mobile devices as well the mobile network. In this paper mobile cloud computing based offloading strategies are proposed for significant energy saving of a femtocell device. Three cases are presented where either data processing, or data encryption and hardware authentication or both are offloaded to the cloud. The power consumption models of the femtocell in these cases are demonstrated in this paper. Simulation results present that the proposed cases reduce the power consumption of the femtocell from 12.27-15.46%, 4.09-5.15% and 8.18-10.31% respectively.","","","","10.1109/AIMOC.2014.6785515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785515","battery life;femtocell;mobile cloud computing;offloading;power consumption","Authentication;Cloud computing;Encryption;Hardware;Mobile communication;Power demand;Radio frequency","cloud computing;energy conservation;femtocellular radio;mobile computing;telecommunication computing","data encryption;data processing;energy efficient offloading strategies;energy saving;femtocell network;hardware authentication;low power base station;mobile cloud computing;mobile network","","2","","30","","","Feb. 27 2014-March 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scale and ubiquity of the Internet makes it the natural network of choice for grid computing. However, for some applications, rate- and delay-guaranteed communication services are needed. These needs are driving the exploration of connection-oriented (CO) optical networks as a candidate for grid computing. In this article, we consider the suitability of CO networks equipped with generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) control-plane protocols for grid computing. We identify two areas in which current GMPLS implementations need enhancements to better support the needs of grid computing. First, we note a need to improve call setup delays by several orders of magnitude. We describe our proof-of-concept prototype implementation of a hardware-accelerated RSVP-TE engine that cuts setup delays from hundreds of milliseconds (typical in current equipment) to the order of microseconds. Second, noting the availability of different types of CO networks, we present a case for enhancements to control ""heterogeneous connections,"" that is, connections that traverse multiple types of CO networks. We describe a distributed signaling procedure for the setup of such connections.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2006.1607874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607874","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer vision;Concurrent computing;Delay;Grid computing;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Optical fiber networks;Recruitment","Internet;grid computing;multiprotocol label switching;optical fibre networks;telecommunication signalling","Internet;connection-oriented networks;control-plane protocols;delay-guaranteed communication services;distributed signaling procedure;generalized multiprotocol label switching;grid computing;heterogeneous connections;optical networks","","12","","10","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The idea of bandwidth borrowing in HTB makes it suitable for large scale high-performance scenario such as cloud computing. However, the capacity of current HTB is only 0.5 Gbps, which could not afford the high traffic rate and user concurrency in the cloud. In this paper, a parallel HTB mechanism is proposed: new algorithms are designed to reduce concurrency in HTB key structure access. Then, the usage of lock-free FIFOs parallelizes HTB into a 2-stage pipeline on the multi-core architecture. This parallel HTB could not only increase the processing rate, but also keep a well performance on stability, which is important for cloud computing. The simulation results prove that parallel HTB's capacity can easily break 1 Gbps, and reach 2 Gbps at most, increasing the performance as high as 300% compared to the traditional HTB. This makes it an effective network traffic control mechanism for cloud computing. Moreover, our work is the first one to make HTB run in the pipelined fashion on a multi-core processor.","","978-1-4244-9405-7","978-0-7695-4302-4","10.1109/CloudCom.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708473","cloud computing;multi-core parallelization;network traffic control;pipelining implementation","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Kernel;Linux;Multicore processing;Pipeline processing;Traffic control","cloud computing;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pipeline processing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;token networks","2-stage pipeline architecture;cloud computing;hierarchical token bucket;lock free FIFO;multicore processor;packet scheduler HTB;parallel network traffic control mechanism;user concurrency","","1","","28","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrinsic to the notion of such environments is the capturing of location and context information. Context awareness and validation enables significant functionality to pervasive computing applications, users, resources and the ways they interact. Much of this functionality depends on validating context information and using it for granting access to data or resources. In this paper we propose an encryption and access control framework that uses both context and identity to determine whether an entity or a group of entities may access protected services, data, devices, and other resources. We assume that the resources are context-sensitive, thus requiring the requesting entity to be under a specific context before it is able to access the resource or decrypt the information. Our approach is unique in the way that we decouple context from identity, which adds extra security, facilitates value-added services, and enables efficient key management for group communication","","0-7695-2520-2","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598987","","Access control;Context awareness;Context-aware services;Cryptography;Identity management systems;Identity-based encryption;Information security;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Protection","authorisation;cryptography;ubiquitous computing","context awareness;context information validation;context-aware encryption;context-sensitive resource;data access control framework;group communication;group key management;location-aware encryption;pervasive computing","","3","1","16","","","13-17 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grid computing can be used to solve the problem by evenly distributing the workload of the system to all the available nodes, thus greatly enhancing the performance of feedback analysis in a learning system. We use hyper grid learning system (HGLS)-a learning system with examination service-we developed as an example to describe the proposed scheme. We note that although discussed in the context of HGLS, the proposed scheme can be easily adapted and applied to all the e-learning systems based on grid computing.

Found., Arlington, VA, USA","Proceedings of the IEEE","20050228","2005","93","3","692","697","The advent of Grid computing has enhanced our capabilities to model and simulate complex systems arising in scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The premise of Grid computing has been ""on-demand"" availability of computational resources to an application as needed, in the same manner as electricity is provided readily through electrical power grids. The computational grid (or simply the ""Grid"") entails ubiquitous access to resources (local or remote), such as computation and communication resources, as well as access to storage systems and visualization systems. As Grid computing technologies mature, it behooves to look beyond the current capabilities, into more advanced future environments. The environments of interest here are the enhanced capabilities that can be created by the paradigm of dynamic data driven applications systems (DDDAS). DDDAS entails the ability to incorporate additional data into an executing application and, in reverse, the ability of applications to dynamically steer the measurement process. The DDDAS concept offers the promise of improving application models and methods, and augmenting the analysis and prediction capabilities of application simulations and the effectiveness of measurement systems. Enabling this synergistic feedback and control loop between application simulations and measurements requires novel application modeling approaches and frameworks, algorithms stable under dynamic data injection and steering conditions, and new systems software and computational infrastructure capabilities. Recent advances in complex applications and the advent of Grid computing and sensor systems are some of the technologies that make it timely to embark in developing DDDAS capabilities. DDDAS environments extend the current notion of Grid infrastructure to also include the measurement systems in an integrated and synergistic way.

However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a ldquonon-greenrdquo computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a ldquopower-hungry GPUrdquo via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-3751-1","978-1-4244-3750-4","10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160980","","Acceleration;Biological information theory;Biology computing;Central Processing Unit;Computer graphics;Electrostatics;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Scientific computing;Space exploration","microprocessor chips;parallel processing;power aware computing;power consumption","biological code;computational accelerator;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy-delay product;graphics processing units;high-end computing;nongreen computing solution;parallel code execution time;power consumption;scientific computing","","28","2","20","","","23-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For trustworthy service selection, reputation based trust model which uses user evaluation to derive the trustworthiness of service behavior is a well known approach. However, it requires voluntary user participation and often has a problem with the lack of gathered data. In general, task based computing provides a task to user which is a composition of services rather than unit services.Therefore, user can't give direct evaluation on unit service. In this paper, we present an autonomic trust extraction method that trust value of service behavior can be extracted without any user intervention. In our method, the interaction between user and service is monitored, and trust value for a service is automatically determined after each interaction according to the number of recurrent interaction with a service and the fact whether the interacted service is bookmarked or not. We also present simulation results that evaluate the proposed model.The results show that our model captures the degree of trustworthy in service behavior r with about 70% ~ 80% of correlation between the actual trust and the estimated trust when user bookmarking ratio is about over 30%.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380413","autonomic;bookmarking;interaction;pervasive computing;service discovery;trust","Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Context-aware services;Data mining;Feedback;Information security;Pervasive computing;Protection","security of data;ubiquitous computing","autonomic trust extraction;pervasive computing;reputation based trust model;task based computing;trustworthy service discovery;trustworthy service selection model;urban computing;user bookmarking ratio","","1","","21","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the existing reconstruction system with filtered back-projection method, an algebraic reconstruction technique based on compressive sampling theory is presented to reconstruct the data from ultrafast computed tomography with fewer projections. Then the connected computing resources at the LSDF are used to implement the 3D CT reconstruction by distributing the whole job into multiple tasks executed in parallel. Promising reconstruction images and high computing performance are reported. For the 3D X-ray CT reconstruction, less than six minutes are actually required. LSDF is not only able to organize data efficiently, but also can provide reconstructed results to users in nearly instantaneous time.

We choose two such from different ends of the computing spectrum-the IGCM model for weather and climate modeling which embodies significant features of a high-performance computing workload, and the ubiquitous PageRank algorithm used in Internet search. In both cases, we are able to show in the affirmative that an inexact system outperforms its exact counterpart in terms of its efficiency quantified through the relative metric of operations per virtual Joule (OPVJ)-a relative metric that is not tied to particular hardware technology. As one example, the IGCM application can be used to achieve savings through inexactness of (almost) a factor of 3 in energy without compromising the quality of the forecast, quantified through the forecast error metric, in a noticeable manner.

We present our approach to session mobility which enables the mobility of platform independent legacy applications in an adaptive manner across a wide range of devices from the desktop computer to the smartphone. Providing such interaction continuity can help alleviate the cumbersome task of manually reinstating sessions on each device encountered, as well as enabling device integration and information centralisation. We discuss the design and implementation issues associated with our system, as well as presenting our test results in comparison to similar approaches to session mobility, thereby demonstrating the advantages of our approach.","","978-1-4244-0971-6","978-1-4244-0971-6","10.1109/ICPCA.2007.4365499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365499","Session mobility;device integration;mobile computing;thin client computing","Application software;Bandwidth;Costs;Environmental management;Mobile computing;Operating systems;Pervasive computing;Resource management;System testing;Ubiquitous computing","human computer interaction;mobile computing;user interfaces","desktop computer;device integration;information centralisation;legacy application;mobile computing;session mobility;smartphone;user interaction","","0","","13","","","26-27 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So that, an organized management, security awareness, and Services Level Agreement (SLA), a contract between a user and a provider of a service specifying the conditions under which a service may be used, will be needed in order to minimize the risk. DMAIC approach can improve quality of cloud computing service level agreement by eliminating non-value added steps. Together with ITIL, DMAIC (Six Sigma) make a great combination for improving the quality of IT service delivery and support.

One of the goals of MTC is to complete large quantities of relatively small tasks within a short timeframe, which lead to huge management overhead. As tasks are competing for limited heterogeneous resources, the resource competition would be prominent. Moreover, in multi-user environment, tasks from different users will have different time constraint, which leads to priority concern. Tasks should be finished before deadline to avoid great loss from user perspective. Traditional scheduling heuristics, which are originally designed for High Throughput Computing (HTC) cannot achieve satisfactory performance in MTC scenario. In this paper, we propose an application-level priority scheduling algorithm. On one hand, we utilize the knowledge of applications to assign different jobs to heterogeneous resources, so as to minimize the Flowtime of the completed jobs. On the other hand, we dynamically adjust the priorities of jobs when scheduling to further improve system performance. Experimental results show that the application-level priority scheduling approach, when compared with other scheduling algorithms, not only attains better performance in both Makespan and Flowtime, but also achieve better turnaround time of jobs in multi-user MTC environment.","","978-1-4799-0836-3","","10.1109/HPCSim.2013.6641470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641470","application-level scheduling;many task computing;priority scheduling;traditional scheduling heuristics","Bioinformatics;Complexity theory;Peer-to-peer computing;Resource management;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","distributed processing;natural sciences computing;scheduling","HTC;application-level priority scheduling algorithm;complex scientific applications;distributed system;flowtime;high throughput computing;makespan;many-task computing;multiuser MTC environment;multiuser heterogeneous environment;time constraint","","0","","18","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies showed that, optimized cloud computing could be seen as an elastic network of resources that are interacting with each other, to minimize the waiting time and utilize the throughput. Therefore load balancing and resource management can be highlighted as the main concerns in cloud computing as they are impacting the network performance directly.

Nowadays, there are several proposed task scheduling algorithms which can be applied in the pervasive computing environment. But most of the existing algorithms are based on static task priority and singular predecessor duplication. And they can not schedule tasks effectively. Consequently, considering these drawbacks and combining the attribute of the pervasive computing, a task scheduling algorithm based on dynamic critical path and multitask duplication (HDCPD) is presented. The HDCPD algorithm is a list and duplication based scheduling algorithm that not only makes use of the dynamical critical path to computing the task priority effectively, but also consider the multi-level task to be duplicated. The simulation results show that this algorithm significantly surpasses previous algorithms in SLR and speedup rate metrics.","","978-1-4244-0971-6","978-1-4244-0971-6","10.1109/ICPCA.2007.4365487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365487","DAG;Pervasive computing;heterogeneous;task duplication;task scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Dynamic scheduling;Pervasive computing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Terminology","multiprogramming;scheduling;ubiquitous computing","dynamic critical path;heterogeneous dynamic critical path;multitask duplication;pervasive computing;speedup rate metrics;static task priority;task scheduling algorithm","","0","","10","","","26-27 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications running on mobile devices may be represented by task graphs.

More precisely, the scheduling problem involves the following steps: (i) determining the tasks to be offloaded onto the cloud, (ii) mapping the remaining tasks onto (potentially heterogeneous) local cores in the mobile device, (iii) determining the frequencies for executing local tasks, and (iv) scheduling tasks on the cores (for in-house tasks) and the wireless communication channels (for offloaded tasks) such that the task-precedence requirements and the application completion time constraint are satisfied while the total energy dissipation in the mobile device is minimized. A novel algorithm is presented, which starts from a minimal-delay scheduling solution and subsequently performs energy reduction by migrating tasks among the local cores and the cloud and by applying the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique. A linear-time rescheduling algorithm is proposed for the task migration.

Fault tolerant computing is not essentially needed to solve a problem. However, it is useful to execute a computing correctly. In this paper, we propose the usage of computational field model (CFM) as a framework to reuse such computing. Computational field is shared virtual space which abstracts distributed systems. It is possible to construct portable applications by applying algorithms to CFM. At first, we employ Triple Module Redundancy (TMR) as basic technique for fault tolerant computing in order to support real-time applications. Next, we assume the locality of fault occasion. For an example, physical crash causes faults locally. In such a case, each module should be distributed to increase system reliability. However, when they are distributed, system performance may be decreased because communication cost is increased. Thus, fault tolerance is related to system performance. In our approach, it is possible to accomplish both resource allocation and fault tolerant computing at the same time.","","0-8186-7889-5","","10.1109/ECBS.1997.581773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581773","","Computational modeling;Computer crashes;Distributed computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Large-scale systems;Redundancy;Reliability;System performance","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;resource allocation","computational field model;fault tolerant computing;large scale distributed systems;resource allocation;shared virtual space;system performance;triple module redundancy","","0","","6","","","24-28 March 1997","24 Mar 1997-28 Mar 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recent advent of Cloud Computing, in the realm of `New Generation Networks', opens a whole new field of envisaging and implementing at least two of its aspects, namely `Software as a Service(SaaS)'and `Platform as a Service(PaaS)' in the field of Network Management(NM). In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a Network Monitoring Framework oriented towards Cloud Computing which we call `CloudCop'. The NM framework uses Web Services (WS) and Service Oriented Computing (SOC) to implement SaaS, while PaaS is provided by providing some of the features such as WS marshalling, integration, storage and persistence.

Existing processes for student's and faculties' vital data collection require a great deal of labor work to collect, input and analyze the information. These processes are usually slow and error prone, introducing a latency that prevents real-time data accessibility. We propose a solution to automate this process by using “documents” attached to existing faculty/ student datasheet that are inter-connected to exchange service. The proposal is based on the concepts of utility computing and cloud computing networks. The information becomes available in the “cloud” from where it can be processed by expert systems and/or distributed to administrative staff. The proof-of-concept design applies commodity computing integrated to legacy education devices, ensuring cost effectiveness and simple integration. In the presented paper, author suggests that IT also have a stronger role in software realization of an expert system.

However, the traditional reasoning about contexts applied a centralized approach which aggravated the load of reasoning server and cost for communication of context. As an important approach for context reasoning, the rule-based reasoning can be easily decomposed of independent propositions. Therefore, the rule-based context reasoning can be decomposed and distributed over those nodes of the ubiquitous environment to decrease the computing load of reasoning server. In this paper, we propose a distributed fuzzy reasoning Petri net model (dFRPN) towards the decomposition of distributed fuzzy reasoning. dFRPN model is able to formalize the distribution of fuzzy reasoning over every node of the whole environment. dFRPN model is characterized as a hierarchical structure to make a description of reasoning on nodes more clear. Considering the limited capabilities of some mobile nodes such as PDA and smart phone, we add the special migrating transition to define the load detection and corresponding actions. At the end of the paper, the feasibility of dFRPN model is validated through a case of context-awareness based personalized recommendation system.","","978-0-7695-3914-0","","10.1109/PDCAT.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5372799","Petri net;distributed reasoning;ubiquitous computing","Computational modeling;Context;Costs;Distributed computing;Fuzzy reasoning;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Scattering;Smart phones;Ubiquitous computing","Petri nets;fuzzy reasoning;mobile computing;recommender systems","Petri net modeling;context reasoning;context-awareness-based personalized recommendation system;distributed fuzzy reasoning;load detection;mobile nodes;rule-based reasoning;ubiquitous computing","","2","","10","","","8-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The whole computing process is based on single circular DNA branch migrations just in a few tubes. For this computing model, two features are circular DNA and rather lower experimental complexity. Moreover, the key methods in this model include displacements of circular ssDNA (single strand DNA) and backtracking deletion algorithm. By repeating of DNA displacements, the correct solutions will be found after computing processes. For a 3-coloring graph problem with n vertices, using this algorithm, the time and space complexity both are O(n2) at most. During the computing course, an effective DNA strand displacement and exclusive sequence recognition ensure the accuracy of computing results. This model demonstrates circular DNA may have more applications in molecular computing.","","978-1-4244-3866-2","978-1-4244-3867-9","10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5338094","","Construction industry;DNA;Environmental economics;Molecular computing;Power generation economics;Power grids;Power supplies;Power transmission;Propagation losses;Substations","backtracking;biocomputing;computational complexity;graph colouring","3-coloring graph problem;NP-problem;backtracking deletion algorithm;circular DNA branch migration;circular DNA strand displacement;circular single strand DNA;exclusive sequence recognition;molecular computing model;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","19","","","16-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Powerful computational techniques are required to understand and analyze biological information encoded by DNA sequences, which are frequently compared and searched for matching or near-matching patterns. Comparison of DNA sequences and genes can be useful to investigate the common functionalities of the corresponding organisms and to get a better understanding of how specific genes or groups of genes are organized. This kind of similarity calculation is known as sequence alignment and its objective is to identify similarities between subsequences of strings. Gene sequence alignment is one such problem that serves as an initial step in many of the problems in bioinformatics. Solving computational biology problems can be accelerated by algorithmic improvements or with the help of high-performance computing architectures. Such architectures include superscalar uniprocessors, parallel systems and dedicated hardware implementations of algorithms. FPGAs have emerged as high-performance computing accelerators, capable of implementing massively parallelized versions of computationally intensive algorithms. Their reprogrammability allows different algorithm-specific computing architectures to be implemented using the same hardware resource. In this article we provide a state of the art review for this field of research. We identify specific algorithmic problems and how hardware architectures can be designed to solve them.

For example, security and privacy are still major roadblocks for cloud adoption, elasticity of cloud computing is not as instantaneous in practice as hyped by marketing, mobility of consumers is not yet addressed completely, etc. While some of these issues will be soon addressed by innovations from academic or industrial research, there are also important challenges that might require fundamental improvements in cloud computing. In particular, a number of consumer applications require security, dependability, or quality of service (QoS) as fundamental features that are built in from the start, instead of being ""add-ons."" On the other hand, the next-generation Internet communication architecture (e.g., from projects on the Internet of Things, the Future Internet, etc.) will also influence cloud computing in the future. These and other challenges and opportunities will soon lead to a new generation of cloud computing systems. This EDOC 2012 discussion session will brainstorm possible features of next-generation cloud computing systems from two-directions: a) by identifying requirements and challenges for overcoming fundamental problems of the current cloud computing systems, b) by pointing out possible visionary architectures of next-generation systems. All EDOC 2012 participants are encouraged to contribute to this discussion. At the beginning of the session, the moderator will give a short introductory presentation to kick-start the discussion, but other participants can also deliver short introductory statements (previously approved by the moderator).

In this regard, this study makes efforts to expose underlying values assigned by users to ubiquitous computing. As a result, a value-focused framework is developed and presented. Twenty-two potential users of were interviewed and four hundred thirty five statements were collected through these interviews, exposing values assigned by users concerning ubiquitous computing. Subsequent purification and redundancy removal reduces these statements into one-hundred and sixty six objectives that these users have in their mind and these objectives were factored into thirty seven objectives through clustering conducted as a focus group session with three experts. These thirty seven objectives were used in building a means-ends network diagram by analyzing reciprocal relationships among them in a focus group activity of another three experts.

Based on the (Spatial Resource Discovery Agent (SRDA) and ordinary neighbor node, Combined with Spatial data model of MAPGIS7.0, this article brings up the geographic structure query language in P2P network (P2PGSQL), and has designed the interpreter of P2PGSQL. In the Peer To Peer and Cooperating Computing Hybrid Discovering Model, this paper has designed the algorithms that construct the distributed hash table and decrease the delay. By discovering and performing the potential swaps that are beneficial to the match between overlay and physical network, it can reduce the average latency and improve the performance of the system. Based on the P2P Cooperating Computing Hybrid Discovering Model, this article has given the method of the P2PGSQL in grid environment and built the mapping model of the global spatial query sentence to the local query sentence. With constituting a global spatial data resource catalog to record the distributing information of all spatial database on each node, P2PGSQL has backed up effective expression of spatial database management mission in grid environment. Hence, P2PGSQL can sustain the query of distribute spatial data in grid environment. This article has extended the grid spatial relation operation (Intersection, Union, Difference) and synthesized operation (Length, Buffer, intersecting region) and so on. The P2PGSQL can reduce the quantity of spatial data transmitting among nodes and enhance the capacity of parallel operation. At the same time, P2PGSQL can also sustain multi-spatial data model by the extension of structure data on the data type.

Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on","20080512","2008","","","360","365","One of the most evident characteristics of an ad hoc ubiquitous computing environment is the dynamism of connections. Due to the mobility of nodes, paths between communicating peers change over time and hence should be discovered continually. Applications also dynamically discover available services and replace connections to provide contextually more appropriate services. In such an environment, the reduction of discovery cost and the reflection of context are main design factors. In order to avoid discovery cost being paid by both application and routing layer and to delay a service binding until forwarding time, we propose a shim layer called shared generic routing (or SGR) that discovers paths by accommodating application layer labels as well as IP addresses as routing targets and manages forwarding states. On top of SGR, IP and application layer routing can be efficiently implemented.

By improved Internet technique, the use of mobile devices is rapidly increased. And some researches in grid computing tried to combine grid computing with mobile devices. However, according to properties of mobile environments, mobile devices have many considerations, such as mobility management, disconnected operation, device heterogeneity, service discovery, resource sharing, security and so on. To conquest these problems, there are two trends for mobile grid computing: a proxy-based mobile grid architecture and an agent-based mobile grid architecture. We focused on a proxy-based mobile grid architecture with IP-paging, which easily manage idle mobile devices and grid resource status information. In result, to support mobile grid services, we propose the IP-paging scheme based on the mobile grid computing framework. Moreover, we have discussed some research issues: location tracking using IP-paging, limited power using grid paging cache, and service migration using reserved resource. And, we also propose a mobile proxy and paging agent prototype.","1976-0035","978-1-4244-5131-9","","10.1109/ICUT.2009.5405730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5405730","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer science education;Grid computing;Internet;Mobile computing;Mobile radio mobility management;Paging strategies;Resource management;Scheduling","IP networks;Internet;grid computing;mobile computing","IP-paging;Internet;agent-based mobile grid architecture;device heterogeneity;disconnected operation;grid paging cache;idle mobile resource discovery;location tracking;mobile grid computing;mobility management;proxy-based mobile grid architecture;resource management;resource sharing;security;service discovery;service migration","","1","1","18","","","20-22 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can be applied to a range of areas, including ecommerce, health, education, communities, etc which are emerging as the important sectors in today's market. Day-byday more knowledge is added to the internet and is shared amongst the users in addition to the official use over the cloud. As a result the energy consumption by the networks is increasing and it needs to be managed. This usage can be brought into account for measuring and hence conserving the energy. The consumption is all together considered for the processing, storage and transport of the knowledge granules over the cloud. Since the data accessed in the cloud is “ondemand”, the prediction techniques like those using rough sets can be used to minimize the transfer of data over the cloud networks. The data over the cloud can be procured with the help of rough set based methods efficiently which can help in conserving the energy. Recently, the basic rough set theory has been extended to the notion of neighbourhood based rough sets where information systems with heterogeneous features are prevalent. In this paper, we propose a neighbourhood based rough set approach for knowledge acquisition using MapReduce from Big Data.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056958","Big Data;Cloud Computing;Distributed Systems;MapReduce;NB-rough Sets;Rough Set","Big data;Rough sets;Runtime","Big Data;Internet;cloud computing;distributed programming;energy consumption;knowledge acquisition;power aware computing;rough set theory","Big Data;Internet;MapReduce;cloud computing;cloud networks;computing-as-a-product;computing-as-aservice;energy conservation;energy consumption;heterogeneous features;information systems;knowledge granules;neighbourhood based rough set theory;neighbourhood systems based knowledge acquisition","","0","","21","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method depends upon random moves. So sometimes the time consumed by this algorithm is much more than expected. With an aim to get rid of this problem, in this paper we propose an entirely new approach of evolutionary algorithm based on quantum computing. A quantum evolutionary algorithm can be termed as a concept which utilizes certain tools of quantum computing for search and optimization purposes. A quantum algorithm relies heavily on qubits and quantum gates. Qubits are the entities which actually contain information in quantum computing. They can either remain in a secluded state or a superposition of two or more qubits states. When they are in a superposition state we employ the concepts of probability to predict where they can actually be found. On the other hand quantum gates utilize qubits to achieve some predefined goals. These predefined goals in case of an optimization problem are to maximize or minimize some sort of objective function. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm employing quantum computing to address optimization problems. We have tested our algorithm on a famous problem known as Gear Train Design Problem. The results so obtained outperform the classical optimization methods.","","978-1-4244-6367-1","","10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5529653","Evolutionary algorithm;Objective function;Quantum computing;Search and Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Conference management;Embedded computing;Engineering management;Evolutionary computation;Information management;Information technology;Optimization methods;Quantum computing;Technology management","embedded systems;evolutionary computation;quantum computing","analytical optimization algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;gear train design problem;hand quantum gates;quantum computing;qubits;superposition state","","1","","18","","","22-24 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through context-aware, these changes can raise the emergence that makes the swarming system more coherent, adaptive and robust. Understanding and exploiting emergence is key to study and engineer global coherent behavior in pervasive computing.

AT provides software tools to people with disabilities. Unfortunately, these pieces of software are not easy to configure when a disabled user needs to occasionally use a shared computer, e.g., in an internet point, in a library, in a campus, and so on. The proposed solution allows users to access remote Virtual Machines (VMs) through an HTML5 web interface. These virtual environments meet the user's personal demand: they support both traditional desktop applications and customized AT tools. In this way, people with disabilities can use any networked computer with a web browser to manage their personal working environments. Nevertheless, achieving such a goal in a cloud computing environment is not trivial at all, because existing remote desktop client viewer applications have not been designed to support the interaction with AT software running on VMs. To achieve such an objective, we propose an open source cloud-based system including no VNC as HTML5 remote desktop proxy/client web application, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) as open source technology to access a remote VM, Oracle Virtual Box as hypervisor, and CLEVER as Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) middleware.","","978-0-7695-5168-5","","10.1109/NCCA.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786774","HTML5;VNC;assistive technology;cloud computing;disabled user;virtualization","Browsers;Cloud computing;Computers;Keyboards;Mice;Servers","cloud computing;middleware;online front-ends;public domain software;virtual machines;virtualisation","CLEVER;HTML5 Web interface;Oracle Virtual Box;Web browser;assistive technology;cloud computing;open source cloud-based system;people with disabilities;personal working environments;remote VM;remote desktop client viewer applications;remote virtual machines;software tools;virtual infrastructure manager middleware;virtual network computing;virtualization technology","","1","","22","","","5-7 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objects jointly form a pervasive computing platform, open for third-party independently developed applications. A challenge is how to support people in deploying and managing such applications. Today, the user perceives an application as an immaterial artifact, accessed through a screen-based interface of a general-purpose computing device. Contrary to that established paradigm, we propose to reify the pervasive computing application as a simple physical thing, called the “application pill.” The pill can easily be grasped and operated: the user brings the pill home, switches it on, and checks if it works just by glancing at its on/off diode. As the application is destined for many homes, each featuring a different collection of objects, the user should be provided with high-level feedback on how well the application can work in her home. Accordingly, the application pill is also equipped with a simple “functionality level” indicator. The degree to which the application can deliver its functionality on top of an available object collection is captured as a single number and displayed by the pill. We present a concrete proof-of-concept elaboration and implementation of these ideas in a pervasive computing middleware platform targeted at cooperating objects.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6525610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525610","","Actuators;Consumer products;Home appliances;Home automation;Intelligent sensors;Middleware;Pervasive computing","home automation;home computing;touch sensitive screens;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces","application pill;cooperating objects;functionality level indicator;general-purpose computing device;graspable applications;high-level feedback;object collection;on/off diode;pervasive computing middleware platform;resource-flexible applications;screen-based interface","","0","","","","","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a new type of client, i.e., a scheduling proxy that enables adaptive-grained scheduling between the server and clients. While the server allocates coarse-grained work units to scheduling proxies alone, clients download fine-grained work units from a relatively nearby scheduling proxy not from the distant server. By computation of small work units at client side, the turnaround time of work unit can be reduced and the waste of CPU time by timeout can be minimized without increasing the performance cost of contention at the server.","1550-5510","0-7695-2256-4","","10.1109/GRID.2004.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382860","adaptive scheduling;desktop grid;global computing system;task granularity","Adaptive scheduling;Central Processing Unit;Concurrent computing;Costs;Grid computing;Internet;Network servers;Parallel processing;Power engineering computing;Processor scheduling","Internet;client-server systems;grid computing;resource allocation;scheduling","CPU resources;Internet;adaptive-grained scheduling;coarse-grained scheduling;desktop grid;global computing system;task granularity","","0","","13","","","8 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One solution path to address this challenge is to use a dynamical information processing approach that harnesses the intrinsic dynamics of networks of emerging devices. In this paper we employ an approach inspired by reservoir computing, a machine learning technique, to perform computations with memristive device networks that show variation and unstructuredness. Reservoir computing harnesses the nonlinear transient dynamics of such networks and is thus ideally suited for our memristive devices. We, for the first time, apply the reservoir computing approach to a regular structured reservoir and show, on a simple signal classification problem, that this architecture is highly tolerant towards device variation. Furthermore we prove that, compared to unstructured random reservoirs, regular structured reservoirs lead to better average performance as well as to higher variation tolerance. Based on our results of the signal classification task, we argue that harnessing the intrinsic non-linear and time-dependent properties of memristive device networks has the potential to lead generally to more efficient, cheaper, and more robust nanoscale electronics.","","978-1-4799-0873-8","","10.1109/NanoArch.2013.6623028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623028","memristor;reservoir computing;variation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Error analysis;Memristors;Performance evaluation;Reservoirs;Resistance","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);memristors;nanoelectronics","device variation;machine learning technique;memristive reservoirs;nanoscale electronics;nonlinear transient dynamics;regular structured reservoir;reservoir computing;signal classification task;variation-tolerant computing","","1","","","","","15-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This limitation could cause long resource waiting time when multiple resources need to be co-allocated. In contrast, the Adaptive Distributed/Parallel Applications (ADA), allowing resources to be added and released during executions, can adapt to the dynamic feature of common distributed computing environments (e.g. the Grid). The goal of the work is to create a tool to allow users to easily develop and run ADAs without dealing with the underneath distributed resource environments. We introduce a novel software package, Application Agent (AA), to support the execution of ADAs, including automatic resource allocation, dynamic process deployment, and enabling process wide-area communication. An AA-enabled application can be started on any internet-connected machines and the AA will dynamically configure a virtual machine from the local machine to remote available machines to satisfy the execution. The AA is composed of two parts. The first part is a library of AA interface routines, which contains user-callable functions for developers to integrate their applications with the AA. This second part is the daemons, which dynamically collect computational resources on the Internet to create a wide-area virtual machine to execute an application.","","978-1-4244-4600-1","978-0-7695-3738-2","10.1109/HPCC.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167045","adaptive application;agents;process deployment;resource allocation;user-oriented software;wide-area distributed computing","Application software;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Costs;Distributed computing;High performance computing;Internet;Parallel processing;Resource management;Virtual machining","Internet;grid computing;resource allocation;software agents;software packages;user interfaces;virtual machines","Internet;adaptive distributed-parallel computing;application agent interface routines;automatic resource allocation;dynamic process deployment;grid computing;software package;user-callable functions;virtual machine","","3","","25","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper presents a flexible and modular network-centered approach for the design of wearable computers. In our concept, a wearable computer is composed of a network of modules. A module can be worn by the user or be stationary in the user's environment. Each is a separate unit with its own processing, memory, I/O, power, and network connection, and provides specific functionality in the network. The modules reveal their abilities and needs to each other and dynamically assemble to form a network-based wearable multi-computer.

Reliability is a key metric for assessing performance in such systems. Fault tolerance methods are extensively used to enhance reliability in Cloud Computing Systems (CCS). However, these methods impose extra hardware and/or software cost. Proper resource allocation is an alternative approach which can significantly improve system reliability without any extra overhead. On the other hand, contemplating reliability irrespective of energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements is not desirable in CCSs. In this paper, an analytical model to analyze system reliability besides energy consumption and QoS requirements is introduced. Based on the proposed model, a new online resource allocation algorithm to find the right compromise between system reliability and energy consumption while satisfying QoS requirements is suggested. The algorithm is a new swarm intelligence technique based on imperialist competition which elaborately combines the strengths of some well-known meta-heuristic algorithms with an effective fast local search. A wide range of simulation results, based on real data, clearly demonstrate high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832090","analytical model;cloud computing;energy-aware scheduling;quality of service;reliability;resource allocation","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Hazards;Quality of service;Resource management;Software reliability","cloud computing;cost reduction;energy consumption;power aware computing;quality of service;resource allocation;search problems;swarm intelligence","QoS requirements;cloud computing systems;cost reduction;energy consumption;energy-aware resource scheduling;imperialist competition;local search;metaheuristic algorithms;online resource allocation algorithm;operational flexibility;performance assessment;quality of service analytical;quality of service requirements;swarm intelligence technique;system reliability","","1","","33","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is getting more significant to discuss how to reduce the total electric power consumption of computers in information systems to realize eco-society. In this paper, we consider a Web type of application on P2P overlay networks. A model shows how much server peer consumes electric power to perform Web requests from client peers. Here we are creating VM migration to consolidate the server utilization. An algorithm is used for a client peer to select a server peer in a collection of server peers so that the total power consumption can be reduced.

New requirements and challenges are today met by the design of a new operational model which is enabled by an old technology (i.e. Virtualization), rather than the implementation of a new technology: Cloud Computing. Although CS is mainly fostering Cloud Computing solutions solely for specific fields, such as enterprise and transactional Web applications (e.g. Amazon EC 2 aws.amazon.com/ec2), this pervasive paradigm is generating a metaphor that enables to access and share software in the Internet as data in a way which is natural for human beings. It is in the opinion of this paper that CS should not ignore the empowerment brought by such a social media oriented Cloud approach. Supporting knowledge construction and social behaviour, individuals are actively engaged in envisioning a new participatory model for the future of cultural creation [12]. A structured approach to Virtualization is proposed as a mean of bringing insight into this new epistemic scenario. Two experiments dealing with Cloud Computing for Virtual heritage are shown as examples: NU.M.E. 2010 as a testing experience in a cultural Metaverse, which confirms the hypothesis of Cloud Computing as a novel paradigm for knowledge construction in the digital humanities; the CINECA MDC (""Museo della Citta"") Project (2009-2011) as an applicative example which enabled to study in a real pipeline production properties of general interest for Virtual Heritage Projects.

"Why neural computing? a personal view","","","Neural Computing Architectures:The Design of Brain-Like Machines","20120924","2003","","","1","7","The sudden growth of interest in neural computing is a remarkable phenomenon that will be seen by future historians of computer science as marking the 1980s in much the same way as research into artificial intelligence (AI) has been the trademark of the 19705. There is one major difference, however: in contrast with AI, which was largely an outlet for a minority of computer scientists, neural computing unites a very broad community: physicists, statisticians, parallel processing experts, optical technologists, neuro physiologists and experimental biologists. The focus of this new paradigm is rather simple. It rests on the recognition by this diverse community that the brain ‘computes’ in a very different way from the conventional computer. This is quite contrary to the focus of the AI paradigm, which is based on the premise that an understanding of what the brain does represents a true understanding only if it can be explicitly expressed as a set of rules that, in turn, can be run on a computer which subsequently performs artificially intelligent tasks. Those who contribute to neural computing believe that the brain, given sensors and a body, builds up its own hidden rules through what is usually called ‘experience’. When a person activates his muscles in complex sequences driven by signals from his eyes, from sensory receptors in his muscles and even from his ears when performing an every-day act such as getting on a bus, or when he notices a ‘polite chill’ in a colleague's voice, these are examples of large numbers of implicit rules at work in a simultaneous and coordinated fashion in the brain. In neural computing it is believed that the cellular structures within which such rules can grow and be executed are the focus of important study as opposed to the AI concern of trying to extract the rules in order to run them on a computer. Neural computing is thus concerned with a class of machines that compute by absorbing experience, and in that sense is a class which includes the brain, but may include other forms with similar properties. It is for reasons of extending interest to these other forms that we have chosen to use the word architectures in the title of this book. Its authors are not latter-day Frankensteins in the business of making brains. They are, however, united in trying to understand computing structures that are brain-like in the sense that they acquire knowledge through experience rather than preprogramming. So, Neural Computinq Architectures is not about the details of mimicking the neurons of the brain and their interconnections, but more about the nature of the broad class of machines which behave in brain-like ways and, through this, adding to both our armoury of knowledge in computing and to our ability to apply such knowledge through the design of novel machinery. Perhaps, from all this it may be possible to draw out a definition of neural computing: Neural computinq is th e study of cellular networks that have a natural propensity for storinq experiential knowledqe. Such systems hear a resemblance to the brain in the sense that knowledge is acquired through traininq rather than programming and is retained due to chanqes in node functions. The knowledge takes the form of stable states or cycles of states in the operation of the net. A central property of such nets is to recall these states or cycles in response to the presentation of cues.","","9780262255592","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6279757.pdf&bkn=6267209&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2003","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Agent Based Web Services(AWS) is an appropriate approach to implement the Enterprise-Agent Design Model, which aims to overcome these inherent limitations of Web Services. In this paper, we report our ongoing efforts to use AWS in a Network Management System(NMS) we have built. Our NMS employs both SNMP and Mobile Agents(Aglets). We are developing an intelligent software agent, which is integrated with the Drools Rule Engine so that appropriate rules are triggered when pre-defined events occur.

However, since such an environment is a heterogeneous system by nature, there are some drawbacks that, if not taken into account, are limiting its applicability.First of all, one has to apply a meta-computing or Grid-enabled message-passing library in order to have the ability to route messages to remote sites as well as still being able to exploit fast site-local network facilities.Then, because the inter-site communication usually constitutes the system's bottleneck, appropriate quality of service parameters should be provided and policed for those connections during the application's execution. And finally, the parallel runtime environment of the distributed application should offer service interfaces in order to enable its interaction with Grid middleware.

This paper reviews recent progress in the area, including design of approximate arithmetic blocks, pertinent error and quality measures, and algorithm-level techniques for approximate computing.","","978-1-4673-6376-1","","10.1109/ETS.2013.6569370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569370","adder;approximate computing;low-energy design;multiplier;probabilistic computing;stochastic computation","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Probabilistic logic;Signal processing algorithms;Timing","adders;logic design;probability;stochastic processes","algorithm-level techniques;approximate arithmetic block design;approximate arithmetic circuits;approximate computing techniques;approximate full adders;digital systems;energy-efficient design;pertinent error;probabilistic computing;quality measures;stochastic computing","","13","","65","","","27-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each provider offers a unique service portfolio with a range of resources. Resource provisioning for cloud services in a comprehensive way is of crucial importance to any resource allocation model. Any model should consider both computational resources and network(data) resources to accurately represent and serve practical needs. We propose a new model to tackle the resource allocation problem for a group of cloud user requests. This includes provisioning for both data center computational resources and network resources. The model is implemented with the objective of minimizing the average tardiness of connection requests. Four combined scheduling algorithms are introduced and used to schedule virtual machines on data center servers and then schedule connection requests on the network paths available. Of the four methods, the method combining Resource Based Distribution technique and Duration Priority technique have shown the best performance getting the minimum tardiness while complying with the problem constraints.","","978-1-4673-2479-3","","10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583561","Cloud Computing;SDN controller;SaaS;Virtual networks;data centers","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data models;Resource management;Schedules;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","cloud computing data centers;cloud services;cloud user requests;computational resources;data center servers;duration priority technique;network resources;resource allocation model;resource based distribution technique;resource provisioning;resource scheduling model;service portfolio;utility computing services;virtual machines","","2","","9","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a Cloud environment, different types of resources need to be virtualized as a collection of Cloud services using virtualization technology. End-users in the Cloud are usually provided with customized Cloud services that involve not only different kinds of computing services but also the networks interconnecting those computing services. Therefore, a set of Cloud computing services and the networking services should be modeled as a composite customized Cloud service. In this paper, we present an improved model for Cloud service provisioning based on our previous Network-Cloud proposal, and propose a procedure with several QoS-aware service selection algorithms for composing different services offered by a Cloud.

An exploration of the use of aggregated HPC resources to solve large-scale engineering problems shows that it's possible to build a computational federation that's easy for end users to implement, and is elastic, resilient, and scalable. Here, the authors argue that the fusion of federated computing and real-life engineering problems can be brought to the average user if relevant middleware is provided.

The improved performance of modern simulation methods coupled with hardware advances is shifting the rate-limiting steps of common biomolecular simulations of small to moderately sized systems from the generation of data (for example, via production molecular dynamics simulations that used to take weeks or even months) to the pre- and postprocessing phases of the workflow, namely, simulation setup and data processing, management, and analysis. Because the computational resources that are optimal for generating data aren't necessarily the same as for processing that data, access to heterogeneous computational resources enables a broader exploration of biomolecular structure and dynamics by facilitating distinct aspects of typical biomolecular simulation workflows, which might not be as efficient on a one-size-fits-all computational platform.","1521-9615","","","10.1109/MCSE.2015.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006387","Biomolecular simulation;GPUs;HPC;analysis;enhanced sampling;heterogeneous computing;high-performance computing;molecular dynamics;scientific computing","Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Chemistry;Computational modeling;High performance computing;Molecular biophysics;Scientific computing","bioinformatics;molecular biophysics;parallel processing","biomolecular analysis;biomolecular simulation;biomolecular structure;biomolecule interaction;data analysis;data management;data processing;heterogeneous computational resources;heterogeneous high-performance computing resources;large-scale high-performance computing resources;modern simulation methods;molecular dynamics simulations;one-size-fits-all computational platform","","0","","65","","2015-01-12","Mar.-Apr. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These trends are forcing application developers to rethink how they are going to best utilize these many-core and multi-core heterogeneous platforms to provide new levels of cost/performance/power in a range of emerging application domains. A key driver in this movement is the recognition that traditional graphics devices can play a larger role in computation than was ever considered before. The high performance computing community has fueled this development, and has demonstrated that Graphics Processing Units can be utilized in a range of general purpose and embedded systems applications. By making this class of devices programmable, a new era in heterogeneous computing has begun. We will discuss some of the catalysts behind these changes, and consider what lies ahead in the future for heterogeneous computing.

The mainstream Grid security solution, Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) for Globus Toolkit (GT), offers comprehensive security services. This is achieved by applying public-key cryptography, cryptographic protocols methodologies and the necessary infrastructural supporting services in which public-key authentication framework (PKI) is the main component. Although an important development from the provisions of security services for distributed computing, it is considered that there is much room for further strengthening GSI in the direction that Grid security can make a clear distinction from distributed computing security. A desired distinction would be that security services for Grid security should manifest and facilitate the Grid feature of advanced resource sharing. In our work, we developed a system called Security Proxy based Tusted Computing (SPTC) modular to enhaced the grid security.","2156-7379","978-1-4244-7939-9","978-1-4244-7941-2","10.1109/ICIECS.2010.5677720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677720","","Authentication;Authorization;Public key;Servers;Software","cryptographic protocols;grid computing;public key cryptography","Globus toolkit;advanced resource sharing;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing security;enhanced grid security infrastructure;grid computing;grid feature;mainstream grid security solution;public-key authentication framework;public-key cryptography;security proxy based tusted computing;security services;trusted computing","","0","","7","","","25-26 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
