Large-tilt angle, single-sided implants were successfully used to control the breakdown voltage by tailoring the asymmetric collector doping profile in a self-aligned way. Because of the lack of carrier confinement in the base of devices built on bulk silicon the common emitter current gain is lower than one. Two options for solving this problem were studied using simulators: Building the LBJT on Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) or introducing SiGe into the base.

It inserts tiny dots, hardly noticeable at normal reading distance, to embed the message. For message extraction, we employ autocorrelation and tiny registration dots to rectify geometric distortions. This technique is robust to distortions resulting from print-scan operations, good quality photocopies, affine transformations and scribblings/stains on the paper. The technique can be applied to documents with large white (or black) areas and they may present characters, drawings, schematics, diagrams, cartoons, but not halftones. The technique is intended to be neither a robust watermark (because any filtering can remove the dots) nor a covert communication (because the dots are perceptible at short distance). Nevertheless, when combined with a perceptual hashing and a cryptography protocol, it can be applied as semi-fragile authentication watermarking for hardcopy two-tone documents. In some situations, the utilization of the proposed system can substitute the use of notarial authenticated photocopies.","1530-1834","978-0-7695-2996-7","","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2007.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4368174","","Amplitude modulation;Authentication;Data encapsulation;Gray-scale;Modulation coding;Optical distortion;Printers;Printing;Robustness;Watermarking","correlation methods;cryptographic protocols;data encapsulation;document image processing;watermarking","affine transformations;autocorrelation;binary documents;cryptography protocol;data hiding;geometric distortions;good quality photocopies;message extraction;perceptual hashing;print-scan operations;printed bicolor documents;semi-fragile authentication watermarking;tiny registration dots","","1","","24","","","7-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interaction of an incident X-ray in the Si crystal generates a phonon source which propagates to the surface at the speed of sound. Such an event produces a several-microsecond-long self-terminating voltage pulse which is proportional to the amount of the sensor area driven normal.

As closed-form solutions are not available for the operational risk distributions, we turn to the Bayesian MCMC algorithm for robust test on the selection. The result shows that with the increase of the iterations, the variance of estimated parameters becomes smaller, so we conclude that the operational risk loss distribution for China's commercial banks meets the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.","","978-1-4577-0788-9","978-0-7695-4464-9","10.1109/BCGIn.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003825","Bayesian;Markov Chain;Monta Carlo;Operational loss","Algorithm design and analysis;Banking;Bayesian methods;Business;Gaussian distribution;Markov processes;Media","Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;banking;inference mechanisms","AIC standard;BIC standard;Bayesian inference;China commercial banks;bayesian MCMC algorithm;generalized extreme value distribution;operational loss distribution calculation;operational risk data","","0","","9","","","29-31 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This investigation was not limited to a particular access network but focused on infrastructure topologies, including ad-hoc networks only when the latter was used to aid the former, which is a method frequently used in cooperative networking. We were interested in proposals aiming to decrease the packet error rate, in order to overcome the bursty error-prone wireless medium, since multicasting cannot simply receive feedback from the users as these will reply simultaneously causing a collision at the source. Hence, in this survey a review is presented showing how researchers proposed to solve this constraint using both modified unicast data transmission and also error correction techniques at various levels of the network protocol stack. However, a survey of multicasting over IEEE 802.16 and 3G radio access networks shows that reliability and resilience was not the only interest in which researchers have shown.

In this paper, a general notion of steady state for nonlinear systems is given where the exogenous system can be unstable. This general notion is defined by the observation from some typical examples in circuit theory and the geometric implications of the classical definition of Isidori and Byrnes. That is, a steady state is characterized by the controlled invariant manifold which has the attractive property. Then by known results from stability theory, some sufficient conditions for the existence of steady states are given.

UAVs support military forces by flying over dangerous zones mainly for surveillance missions. Route planning for UAVs is therefore a critical problem. With many side constraints such as visitation time requirements, mission priorities, and vehicle capabilities, route planning is a hard problem. Heuristic approaches have therefore been developed to construct near optimal routes. Given the hostile operating conditions, however, robustness of these plans is emerging as a more significant concern than optimality. This paper thus investigates the robustness of constructed UAV routes. To this end, a greedy assignment algorithm that takes into consideration physical constraints and operational risks is used to construct UAV tours. The sensitivity of these tours to various operational parameters such as mission threat level, weather risk, and crash rates as well as their interactions is assessed in a simulation study through a set of designed experiments.","0891-7736","978-1-4673-4779-2","978-1-4673-4781-5","10.1109/WSC.2012.6465009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6465009","","Atmospheric modeling;Fuels;Maintenance engineering;Military aircraft;Planning;Robustness;Vehicles","autonomous aerial vehicles;greedy algorithms;military aircraft;mobile robots;path planning","UAV assignments;UAV tours;constructed UAV routes;crash rates;dangerous zones;greedy assignment algorithm;hard problem;military forces;mission priorities;mission threat level;near optimal route construction;operational risks;physical constraints;robustness assessment;route planning;surveillance missions;unmanned aerial vehicles;vehicle capabilities;visitation time requirements;weather risk","","0","","26","","","9-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A coupled thermal-electromagnetic model shows that the thermal-runaway instability can be excited also by relatively low microwave power, in the range ~ 10-100 W, hence by solid-state sources rather than magnetrons. Local melting then occurs in a millimeter scale within seconds in various materials, such as glass, ceramics, basalts, and plastics. The experimental device employs an LDMOS transistor in an oscillator scheme, feeding a miniature microwave-drill applicator. The experimental results verify the rapid heating effect, similarly to the theoretical model. These findings may lead to various material-processing applications of local microwave heating implemented by solid-state devices, including local melting (for surface treatments, chemical reactions, joining, etc.), delicate drilling (e.g., of bones in orthopedic operations), local evaporation, ignition, and plasma ejection (e.g., in microwave-induced breakdown spectroscopy (MIBS) for material identification).","0018-9480","","","10.1109/TMTT.2012.2198233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214998","Hotspots;laterally diffused metal–oxide semiconductor field-effect tranLDMOS-FET;microwave drills;microwave heating;thermal-runaway instabilities","Electromagnetic heating;Glass;Microwave oscillators;Microwave transistors","MOSFET;drilling;driver circuits;microwave field effect transistors;microwave heating","LDMOS transistor;delicate drilling;local microwave heating;localized rapid heating;low power solid state microwave drill;low power transistor based microwave drill;material processing applications;microwave heating effect;miniature microwave-drill applicator;oscillator scheme;solid state device;solid state source;thermal-electromagnetic model;thermal-runaway instability","","6","","40","","2012-06-11","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unlike traditional routing protocols, which use a single path to route traffic between node pairs, NCOR broadcasts data packets to a set of forwarding candidates. Each candidate combines the overheard packets to generate linearly independent packets, which are then forwarded to the destination. The focus of this paper is on the fundamental problem of how to select the candidate forwarder set (CFS) and how to allocate traffic among candidate forwarders to achieve optimal routing. In current literature, CFS selection and traffic allocation have typically been addressed separately. In this paper, we take an integrated approach and propose a minimum cost NCOR model, MIC-NCOR, which addresses the two aspects of the problem jointly. Based on the optimal substructure of MIC-NCOR, we derive a provable algorithm that can be implemented in a distributed fashion, to compute both the optimal CFS and traffic portion for each candidate. An extensive simulation study indicates that MIC-NCOR accurately predicts the quality of NCOR routes. The simulation results also show that the MIC-NCOR algorithm achieves significant throughput improvement over existing NCOR routing schemes, especially in networks with low NCOR cost and high node density.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883368","minimum cost routing;network coding;opportunisitc routing","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Measurement;Network coding;Resource management;Routing;Throughput","broadcast communication;network coding;radio links;radio networks;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","CFS;MIC-NCOR model;candidate forwarder set;communication traffic allocation;data packet broadcasting;intrasession network coding;lossy link;minimum cost NCOR model;minimum cost opportunistic routing;routing protocol;wireless multihop network","","0","","14","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It not only reveals the contribution each growth component makes to total growth, but exhibits the law of development of each growth component on time series. Through the comparative analysis of traditional shift-share method and the developed dynamic model, the later possesses advantages in three aspects: time span, analysis result and range of application. The dynamic model not only reveals the variation characteristics of each industrial department among various provinces, but offers quantitative analysis on industrial structure and varying trend of competitiveness from year to year.

Then, a simple design procedure is given for the output-feedback control of the transformed new system. This procedure is developed by extending the methods by H.L. Choi and J.T. Lim (2005), rather than the backstepping approach by P. Krishnamurthy et al. (2001).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is proven to be a sensitive method of monitoring the progression of this disease and of its changes due to treatment protocols. Quantification of the severity of the disease through estimation of MS lesion volume via MR imaging is vital for understanding and monitoring the disease and its treatment. This paper presents a novel methodology and a system that can be routinely used for segmenting and estimating the volume of MS lesions via dual-echo fast spin-echo MR imagery. A recently developed concept of fuzzy objects forms the basis of this methodology. An operator indicates a few points in the images by pointing to the white matter, the grey matter, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Each of these objects is then detected as a fuzzy connected set. The holes in the union of these objects correspond to potential lesion sites which are utilized to detect each potential lesion as a three-dimensional (3-D) fuzzy connected object. These objects are presented to the operator who indicates acceptance/rejection through the click of a mouse button. The number and volume of accepted lesions is then computed and output. Based on several evaluation studies, the authors conclude that the methodology is highly reliable and consistent, with a coefficient of variation (due to subjective operator actions) of 0.9% (based on 20 patient studies, three operators, and two trials) for volume and a mean false-negative volume fraction of 1.3%, with a 95% confidence interval of 0%-2.8% (based on ten patient studies).","0278-0062","","","10.1109/42.640750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=640750","","Diseases;Fuzzy sets;Image segmentation;Lesions;Magnetic resonance imaging;Mice;Monitoring;Multiple sclerosis;Object detection;Protocols","biomedical NMR;fuzzy set theory;image segmentation;medical image processing","MR image analysis;cerebrospinal fluid;coefficient of variation;confidence interval;false-negative volume fraction;fuzzy connected set;fuzzy-connectedness principles;grey matter;lesion volume estimation;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;multiple sclerosis lesion quantification;subjective operator actions","Algorithms;Brain;Clinical Protocols;Computer Peripherals;Confidence Intervals;Contrast Media;Database Management Systems;Disease Progression;Evaluation Studies as Topic;False Negative Reactions;Fuzzy Logic;Gadolinium DTPA;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis;Observer Variation;Reproducibility of Results","108","2","54","","","Oct. 1997","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, an image normalization based robust digital watermarking scheme in contourlet domain is proposed. Firstly, the geometrically invariant space is constructed by using image normalization and the significant region is obtained from the normalized image by utilizing the invariant centroid theory. Then, the contourlet transform is performed on the significant region. Finally, the digital watermark is adaptively embedded into the significant region by quantizing the low-frequency contourlet coefficients according to the Human Visual System (HVS). Especially, the predistortion compensation technique is applied to reduce image distortion generated by image normalization. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is not only invisible and robust against common signals processing such as noise adding, and JPEG2000 compression, but also robust against the geometric distortion such as rotation, translation, scaling, row or column removal, cropping.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378290","contourlet transform;geometric attacks;image watermarking;normalization","Filter banks;Filtering theory;Robustness;Transform coding;Transforms;Watermarking;Wiener filters","data compression;distortion;edge detection;image coding;image watermarking;transforms","CT;HVS;JPEG2000 compression;anisotropy analysis;contourlet transform;human visual system;image distortion;image normalization;image watermarking algorithm;intrinsic geometrical structures;robust digital watermarking;signal processing","","0","","16","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear control feedback is found to be fully effective only when it is switched off while the state is far from the desired equilibrium point, relying on the attractor of the system to bring the state into a neighborhood of the equilibrium point before control is applied. Linear estimator feedback is found to be fully effective only when (a) the Lyapunov exponent of the state estimation error is negative, indicating that the state estimate converges to the uncontrolled state, and (b) the estimator is stable in the vicinity of the desired equilibrium point. The aim in studying the present problem is to understand better some possible pitfalls of applying linear feedback to nonlinear systems in a low-dimensional framework. Such an exercise foreshadows problems likely to be encountered when applying linear feedback to infinite-dimensional nonlinear systems such as turbulence.

Furthermore, we show that a mapping of the state-based scheduler into one which fulfills this condition, and consequently has an optimal certainty equivalent controller, does not result in an equivalent class of design in the sense of Witsenhausen.

With time-variant power demands and generation capacities, prosumers can exchange energy via local power lines with less transmission loss than the long-distance power lines to the traditional power plants. In this paper, we develop a local power exchange game and address the cheating problem that seller prosumers actually supply insufficient energy instead of the promised amount in the trade. We apply the indirect reciprocity principle to build an anti-cheating local energy exchange system that maintains reputations for the prosumers according to their selling histories. By supplying less energy to the buyers who cheated in previous trades, this system motivates the autonomous prosumers to cooperate instead of cheating. Simulation results have shown that this strategy significantly reduces the number of cheating prosumers and improves the overall system utility. Compared with the direct reciprocity-based counterpart, this system reaches the desirable equilibrium much faster and requires less energy from the traditional energy plants.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883384","","Contracts;Erbium;Information systems;Manganese;Power supplies;Security;Simulation","game theory;power cables;power generation economics;power plants;smart power grids","anti-cheating prosumer energy exchange system;autonomous prosumers;direct reciprocity principle;energy plants;generation capacity;indirect reciprocity;indirect reciprocity principle;local power exchange game;long-distance power lines;power plants;renewable energy generators;smart grids;system utility;time-variant power demands;transmission loss","","1","","23","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VITASCOPE is an ASCII stream driven 3D animation tool that runs readily on a wide variety of hardware platforms ranging from commonly used desktops and laptops to high-end, room-sized, immersive virtual environments such as the CAVE. VITASCOPE parses and interprets an ASCII stream, and imports and manipulates existing 3D CAD models of the simulated system entities to visually depict modeled processes.

Media noise was measured as a function of transition density using a spectrum analyzer. The media noise power at 2400 flux changes per millimeter decreased by a factor of about 10 with the increase in Cr thickness. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in the coercivity squareness and the development of granular features in CoNiCr grains growing on the columns of the Cr underlayer.

However, existing power management algorithms are not designed to sufficiently utilize the features available in many multi-core processors, such as shared L2 caches and per-core DVFS, to effectively minimize processor energy consumption while providing real-time guarantees. In this paper, we propose a two-level utilization control solution for energy efficiency in multi-core real-time systems. At the core level, our solution addresses two optimization objectives: controlling the CPU utilization of each core to its desired schedulable bound and minimizing the core energy consumption by adopting per-core DVFS and dynamic L2 cache partitioning to adapt both the CPU frequency-dependent and independent portions of the task execution times of the core. Since traditional control theory cannot handle multiple optimization objectives, a novel utilization controller is designed based on advanced multi-objective model predictive control theory. At the processor level, a cache demand arbitrator is proposed to coordinate the cache size demand from each core and conduct dynamic cache resizing to minimize the leakage power consumption of the shared L2 caches. The energy and time overheads of the proposed control solution are analyzed and addressed in the experiments with well-known benchmarks. Our extensive results demonstrate that our solution outperforms two state-of-the-art power management algorithms that do not consider L2 caches or per-core DVFS, by having more accurate utilization control and less energy consumption.","1068-3070","978-1-4577-0643-1","","10.1109/ECRTS.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6001773","Multi-core real-time systems;power management;shared cache;utilization control","Frequency control;Multicore processing;Optimization;Power demand;Process control;Real time systems;Time frequency analysis","cache storage;control engineering computing;multiprocessing systems;predictive control;real-time systems","CPU utilization;advanced multiobjective model;cache demand arbitrator;cache size demand;cache-aware utilization control;dynamic L2 cache partitioning;energy efficiency;leakage power consumption;multicore processor;multicore real-time system;percore DVFS;predictive control theory;processor energy consumption;two-level utilization control solution","","3","","30","","","5-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper furthermore addresses certain integrity aspects of the proposed Tight Optical Integration (TOI) method. Target applications for the proposed system include the operation of UAVs in an urban environment for both civil and military applications. A regular unaided GPS position solution requires at least four satellites. However, in an urban canyon it is likely to have fewer than four GPS satellites at certain locations due to satellite signal blockage and degradation. Augmentation of GPS with measurements from other sensors is thus required for a reliable navigation capability in an urban environment. TOI integrates range measurements from the available GPS satellites (usually less than four) with feature data from a regular camera to form position estimates. If a building blocks a GPS satellite, markers or features on that building can be located and used as an ""optical pseudolite."" Unlike pseudolite or laser range scanner measurements, no range information is required from the optical sensor. Instead, the TOI algorithm takes the estimated azimuth and elevation of the marker to form an equivalent direction cosine for this marker. Then, these direction cosines are combined with range measurements from GPS satellites in a weighted least square solution. The current implementation of the TOI method forms linearized camera equations together with the linearized GPS equations and solves for the solution iteratively similarly to a regular GPS only solution. Inertial sensors are used to transform direction cosines from the camera frame to the GPS frame.","","978-1-4244-1536-6","978-1-4244-1537-3","10.1109/PLANS.2008.4570066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4570066","","Degradation;Digital cameras;Equations;Global Positioning System;Integrated optics;Military satellites;Optical sensors;Performance analysis;Position measurement;Satellite navigation systems","Global Positioning System;avionics;cameras;inertial navigation;optical sensors","GPS;UAV;civil applications;digital vision cameras;direction cosines;inertial sensors;integrity aspects;least square solution;military applications;optical sensors;performance analysis;satellite signal blockage;tight optical integration","","2","","15","","","5-8 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the case of mobile devices that are connected to the Internet, there is possible use of different DNS servers at each location, with infrastructure warranting different degrees of trust for disaster management. In this work we propose the development of a trust model for DNS for cases of trust management. In particular we focus on different name resolution scenarios and protocols.

A text-to-image retrieval model requires an incremental learning method for its practical use since the multimodal data grow up dramatically. Here we propose an incremental text-to-image retrieval method using a multimodal association model. The association model is based on a hypernetwork (HN) where a vertex corresponds to a textual word or a visual patch and a hyperedge represents a higher-order multimodal association. Using the HN incrementally learned by a sequential Bayesian sampling, in the multimodal hypernetwork-based text-to-image retrieval, a given text query is crossmodally expanded to the visual query and then similar images are retrieved to the expanded visual query. We evaluated the proposed method using 3,000 images with textual description from Flickr.com. The experimental results present that the proposed method achieves very competitive retrieval performances compared to a baseline method. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method provides robust text-to-image retrieval results for the increasing data.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378291","hypernetworks;incremetnal learning;text-to-image retrieval;textual-visual association","Boats;Data models;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Training;Visualization","Bayes methods;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs);sampling methods;vertex functions","Flickr.com;higher-order multimodal association;hyperedge;incremental association;incremental learning method;incremental text-to-image retrieval method;multimodal association model;multimodal data;multimodal hypernetwork;sequential Bayesian sampling;textual query;vertex;visual patch;visual query","","1","","11","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Kiwi system is targeted at making reconfigurable computing technology accessible to software engineers that are willing to express their computations as parallel programs. Although there has been much work on compiling sequential C-like programs to hardware by automatically `discoveringÂ¿ parallelism, we work by exploiting the parallel architecture communicated by the designer through the choice of parallel and concurrent programming language constructs. Specifically, we describe a system that takes .NET assembly language with suitable custom attributes as input and produces Verilog output which is mapped to FPGAs. We can then choose to apply analysis and verification techniques to either the highlevel representation in C# or other .NET languages or to the generated RTL netlists. A distinctive aspect of our approach is the exploitation of existing language constructs for concurrent programming and synchronization which contrasts with other schemes which introduce specialized concurrency control constructs to extend a sequential language.","","978-0-7695-3307-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2008.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724884","high level synthesis;parallel programming","Assembly systems;Circuit synthesis;Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Parallel architectures;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Software libraries","circuit analysis computing;field programmable gate arrays;parallel architectures;parallel programming",".NET assembly language;C# parallel programs;FPGA circuit synthesis;Kiwi parallel programming library;concurrent programming;parallel architecture;programming language;reconfigurable computing technology;sequential C-like programs;sequential language;software engineers","","18","","14","","","14-15 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we have studied the accuracy of the reconstructed charge distributions by numerical simulations of the inverse calculation.

While the concept of context-related access control is not new, this is the first work that brings this concept into the smartphone environment. In particular, in our work, a context can be defined by: the status of variables sensed by physical (low level) sensors, like time and location; additional processing on these data via software (high level) sensors; or particular interactions with the users or third parties. CRêPE allows context-related policies to be set (even at runtime) by both the user and authorized third parties locally (via an application) or remotely (via SMS, MMS, Bluetooth, and QR-code). A thorough set of experiments shows that our full implementation of CRêPE has a negligible overhead in terms of energy consumption, time, and storage, making our system ready for a production environment.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215040","Android security;context policy;smartphone security","Access control;Companies;Context;Runtime;Sensors;Smart phones","authorisation;operating systems (computers);smart phones","Android;CRêPE;context-related access control;fine-grained context-related policy enforcement system;smartphone systems;software sensors;third parties","","5","","47","","2012-06-11","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This fully specified verification simulation approach was developed to meet this challenge. During the verification simulation, the fully specified driver not only supplies the stimulus, it also drives the simulator to check the outputs from the circuit under rest. It eliminates the manual check of simulation results. It saves a lot of time in repeating this check for the debugging and verification of different design representations. This approach also improves design quality because the executable fully specified driver can be used as a verification specification document which is so readable that another designer in the team can audit it. Precedence network technique is used to optimize the sequence and concurrence relationship of stimulus tasks and expectation tasks because they are often invoked concurrently.

It is preferred with the advantage of that it doesn't require any extra hardware equipment. However, traditional demagnetization control method strongly depends on the parameters of DFIG.

This paper proposes a policy management service that offers scalable management of data retention policies attached to data objects stored in a cloud environment. The management service includes a highly available and secure encryption key store to manage the encryption keys of data objects. By deleting the encryption key at a specified retention time associated with the data object, we effectively delete the data object and its copies stored in online and offline environments. To achieve scalability, our service uses Hadoop MapReduce to perform parallel management tasks, such as data encryption and decryption, key distribution and retention policy enforcement. A prototype deployed in a 16-machine Linux cluster currently supports 56 MB/sec for encryption, 76 MB/sec for decryption, 31,000 retention policies/sec read and 15,000 retention policies/sec write.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990674","cloud service;data retention;encryption key store;large-scale policy management;regulatory compliance","Cryptography;Decision support systems;Engines;Google;Laboratories;Protocols","cloud computing;cryptography;data integrity;data privacy","EU privacy;HIPAA;Hadoop MapReduce;Linux cluster;PCI-DSS;cloud computing;data access;data availability;data decryption;data encryption;data integrity;data migration;data retention policy management;encryption keys management;key distribution;management service;parallel management tasks;regulatory policy;retention policy enforcement","","0","","25","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Erdol and Bao (see Proceedings of the Asilomar Conf. on Signals, Systems and Computers, 1993) addressed the classical problem of detection of a message signal in white noise by considering a variable coefficient wavelet series expansion of the input signal. It is shown that, given the hypothesis that there exists a wavelet eigen basis of the message signal, then the optimization problem of searching for the eigen wavelet may be transformed into a search over an array of variables. These variables are shown to be the coefficients that arise in the representation of one wavelet basis in terms of another.

In this paper, we present a non-key based security scheme for the emergency treatment of IMDs, named the BodyDouble. This scheme employs an external authentication proxy embedded in a gateway to authenticate the identity of a programmer. The gateway here employs a transmitting antenna to send data and jamming signals. When an adversary launches attacks, the gateway jams the request signal to the IMD and authenticates its identity. The gateway will also pretend to be the wireless module of the IMD by establishing a communication link with the adversary so that the adversary is spoofed to communicate with the gateway instead of the IMD. For the emergency situation, the IMD can be accessed without using any cryptographic keys by simply powering off or removing the gateway. Simulation results show that this security scheme can protect the IMD from the adversary's attacks successfully, and resist the potential repeated attacks to prevent the battery depletion of the IMD.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883392","","Authentication;Jamming;Logic gates;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Wireless communication","biomedical telemetry;computer network security;prosthetics;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","emergency treatment;external authentication proxy;implantable medical devices;nonkey based security scheme;wireless communication module;wireless implants","","0","","12","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, from the frame, the H-infinity optimization problem for minimizing L<sub>2</sub>-norm of a weighted disturbance estimation error is formulated.

Previous work (J. Bennet et al., 1999) has demonstrated that TCP suffers degraded performance in situations of high packet reordering. This paper will consider why video traffic over UDP also performs badly in situations of high packet reordering, due to the temporal inter-packet dependencies introduced by the MPEG video encoding structure. Wireless networks are especially prone to problems due to the higher levels of link layer retransmissions found in noisy wireless environments.

Our results show that among all tested detectors, the Hessian-Affine detector leads to the most robust performance in the presence of strong JPEG compression. Additionally, we compare the retrieval gains of the different detector-descriptor pairs after processing the JPEG-encoded query images with different deblocking filters. The results illustrate that for the MSER, MFD and WαSH detectors, the retrieval results benefit from two of the deblocking approaches at low bit rate irrespective of what descriptor the detectors are combined with. The same two deblocking filters are found to increase the retrieval performance for the MROGH descriptor when combined with most of the tested detectors.","","","","10.1109/MMSP.2013.6659259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659259","","Detectors;Electronics packaging;Feature extraction;Image coding;Image retrieval;PSNR;Transform coding","affine transforms;data compression;feature extraction;filters;image coding;image retrieval","Hessian-Affine detector;JPEG compression;JPEG-encoded query images;MFD detectors;MROGH descriptor;MSER detectors;VLBenchmarks retrieval framework;WαSH detectors;content-based image retrieval;deblocking filters;feature detector-descriptor combinations","","1","","36","","","Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of this analysis within two separate projects, one involving conversion of existing software and one involving development of software, is discussed to demonstrate the process. It is concluded that the processes identified and needing to be trusted were those which violated the security model; all other security-related processes are supplied by the TCB.

At the band gap frequencies, the two pure modes couple so as to result in no propagation.

The heater delays, i.e., the time delay between the heater activation and consequent normal zone initiation in the winding, were simulated using the 2-D thermal modelling tool CoHDA, which has been successfully used for low-temperature superconductor (LTS) coils. In addition to the quench onset criterion used for LTS, requiring the cable maximum temperature to reach the current sharing temperature (T<sub>cs</sub>), a criterion accounting for the current redistribution within a cable was introduced in the model. The heater delays were analysed as a function of various heater parameters, their value ranges were based on the heaters in the recent LTS magnets: heater powers (PPH(t = 0) = 20-200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), heating station lengths (down to 10 mm) and insulation thickness's (up to 150 μm Kapton). The simulated delays in the reference YBCO-cable (T<sub>op</sub> = 4.5 K, I = 5 kA, B = 20 T (parallel to cable's wide surface), Tcs = 16.5 K) were mainly between 20 and 100 ms. The heater efficiency seriously decreased for T<sub>cs</sub> above 20 K when the cable energy margin approached the energy provided by the protection heater. Although experiments are needed to confirm these results, it seems clear that heater based quench protection for HTS-based accelerator magnets requires significant technology developments.","1051-8223","","","10.1109/TASC.2014.2363523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926839","High Temperature Superconductors;High temperature superconductors (HTSs);Protection heaters;Quench protection;protection heaters;quench protection;thermal modelling","Cable insulation;Coils;Delays;Heating;High-temperature superconductors;Superconducting cables;Superconducting magnets","barium compounds;high-temperature superconductors;quenching (thermal);superconducting cables;superconducting coils;yttrium compounds","2D thermal modelling tool CoHDA;YBCO;YBCO-cable;cable energy margin;cable maximum temperature;current redistribution;current sharing temperature;heater activation;heater parameters;heater powers;heating station lengths;high-temperature superconductor coil;high-temperature superconductor-based accelerator magnets;high-temperature superconductor-based accelerator type magnet;insulation thickness;low-temperature superconductor coils;normal zone initiation;quench onset criterion;quench protection heater delays;quench protection heater technology efficiency;size 10 mm;time 100 ms;time 20 ms;time delay","","2","","20","","2014-10-16","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

QoS routing is used to find QoS available paths that map QoS requirements, based on network information acquired during the route discovery process, and/ or using periodic monitoring. If the QoS demand goes beyond the network capacity, the call admission procedure generally rejects any incoming QoS request, thus, avoiding quality deterioration of existing QoS flows. However, channel conditions are likely to change and might threaten the QoS provision at any time. Therefore, a strategy is needed to reinstate QoS guarantees when at risk. Whenever Best-Effort traffic deterioration is not applicable or useless, a QoS flow has to be sacrificed for the sake of others. The selection of the victim QoS flow expresses a need for conflict resolution policies.

The graph edges are layered around thumbnail wheels consisting of color-coded sectors that are representatives of the graph nodes. These sectors generate implicit representations of graph edges. Start and target vertices are perceived by inspecting the color coding of sectors in the context of other sectors and their orientations. The technique puts emphasis on newer relations and hence, these are mapped to a larger display space in the radial diagram. The benefit of our technique is reduction of visual clutter from which node-link diagrams typically suffer. The visualization focuses on an easy exploration of trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in time-varying relational data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to dense dynamic graph data acquired from a soccer match of the 2D Soccer Simulation League.","1550-6037","978-1-4577-0868-8","","10.1109/IV.2011.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004017","Dynamic Graph Visualization;Indented Tree Plot;TimeRadarTrees","Animation;Data visualization;Encoding;Image color analysis;Layout;Organizations;Visualization","data visualisation;diagrams;directed graphs;sport;trees (mathematics)","2D soccer simulation league;color-coded sectors;data visualization;directed multi-graphs;indented tree plots;layered timeradartrees;radial diagram;time-varying relational data;weighted multi-graphs","","3","","22","","","13-15 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Abnormal situations and the potential quality problems in the production process can be judged and revealed according to the state of control chart. Thus the recognition of control chart is of great importance. To improve patterns recognition performance of control chart, a new method based on improved sequential forward selection (ISFS) and extreme learning machine (ELM) was presented. Firstly the 13 time domain features were extracted from control chart; secondly, the improved sequential forward selection method was used to select the features to reduce the relevance and redundancy between features and improve recognition rate; finally, ELM was adopted to identify control chart.

The techniques described in this paper allow multiscale Poisson signal and image reconstruction methods to be implemented with significantly less computational complexity than previously possible. Fast translation-invariant Haar denoising for Poisson data is accomplished by deriving the relationship between maximum penalized likelihood tree pruning decisions and the undecimated wavelet transform coefficients.

In order to find the right feature for this task, we first present a comprehensive experimental study on pedestrian detection using state-of-the-art locally extracted features (e.g., local receptive fields, histogram of oriented gradients, and region covariance). Building upon the findings of our experiments, we propose a new, simpler pedestrian detector using the covariance features. Unlike the work in [1], where the feature selection and weak classifier training are performed on the Riemannian manifold, we select features and train weak classifiers in the Euclidean space for faster computation. To this end, AdaBoost with weighted Fisher linear discriminant analysis-based weak classifiers are designed. A cascaded classifier structure is constructed for efficiency in the detection phase. Experiments on different datasets prove that the new pedestrian detector is not only comparable to the state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors but it also performs at a faster speed. To further accelerate the detection, we adopt a faster strategy-multiple layer boosting with heterogeneous features-to exploit the efficiency of the Haar feature and the discriminative power of the covariance feature. Experiments show that, by combining the Haar and covariance features, we speed up the original covariance feature detector [1] by up to an order of magnitude in detection time with a slight drop in detection performance.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.928213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559598","AdaBoost;Pedestrian detection / classification;boosting with heterogeneous features;local features;pedestrian detection/classification;support vector machine","","Haar transforms;computer vision;covariance analysis;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","AdaBoost training;Euclidean space;Haar feature;boosted covariance features;cascaded classifier structure;computer vision;covariance features;feature selection;locally extracted features;multiple layer boosting;pedestrian detection;weighted Fisher linear discriminant analysis","","50","","27","","2008-07-09","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose to address this problem through the use of a wavelet-based speech enhancement technique since the wavelet transform can achieve good denoising performance. The over complete rational-dilation wavelet transform is then exploited to effectively process speech signals due to its higher frequency resolution. In addition, we exploit the joint distribution of the speech in the wavelet domain and develop a novel local noise variance estimator based on the bivariate shrinkage function. As will be shown, our proposed algorithm achieves good direction-of-arrival performance in the presence of noise.","","978-1-4244-8301-3","978-0-7695-4215-7","10.1109/CW.2010.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655062","DOA estimation;denoising;speech source localization;wavelet","Direction of arrival estimation;Estimation;Noise reduction;Signal to noise ratio;Speech;Wavelet transforms","acoustic signal detection;direction-of-arrival estimation;speech enhancement;wavelet transforms","bivariate shrinkage function;denoising performance;direction of arrival algorithm;frequency resolution;local noise variance estimator;noisy environment;phase transform prefilter;rational dilation wavelet transform;signal to noise condition;speech distribution;speech signal processing;speech source localization;wavelet based speech enhancement technique","","0","","11","","","20-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scaling of computational power is one of the main reasons for transition to a multicore environment. In most cases parallelization of existing algorithms is time consuming and error prone, dealing with low-level constructs. Migrating principles of object-oriented design patterns to parallel embedded software avoids this. We propose a top-down approach for refactoring existing sequential to parallel algorithms in an intuitive way, avoiding the usage of locking mechanisms. We illustrate the approach on the well known Fast Fourier Transformation algorithm. Parallel design patterns, such as Map Reduce, Divide-and-Conquer and Task Parallelism assist to derive a parallel approach for calculating the Fast Fourier Transform. By combining these design patterns, a robust and better performing application is obtained.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681274","Fast Fourier Transform;multicore embedded software;parallel design patterns","Algorithm design and analysis;Discrete Fourier transforms;Fast Fourier transforms;Instruction sets;Optimization;Signal processing algorithms;Software algorithms","embedded systems;fast Fourier transforms;multiprocessing systems;object-oriented methods;parallel algorithms;software maintenance","Parallel design patterns;fast Fourier transformation algorithm;low-level constructs;multicore embedded systems;object-oriented design patterns;parallel algorithms;parallel embedded software;software design patterns;software refactoring;top-down approach","","0","","15","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the current study, direct measurements of the microbubble apparent stiffness were performed using atomic force microscopy by applying nanoscale compressions (up to 25 nN/s) on size-isolated, phospholipid-coated microbubbles (diameters between 4-6 and 6-8 μm). The apparent stiffness was found to lie between 4 and 22 mN/m and to decrease exponentially with microbubble size within the diameter range investigated. No cantilever spring constant effect was found on the measured stiffness. The Young's modulus of the sizeisolated microbubbles used in our study ranged between 0.4 and 2 MPa. Microstructures on the surface of the microbubbles were found to influence the overall microbubble elasticity. Our results indicated that more detailed theoretical models are needed to account for the size-dependent microbubble mechanical properties in order to accurately predict their acoustic behavior. The findings provided useful insights to control cavitation-induced drug and gene delivery and could be used as part of the framework in studies on the shear stresses induced on the blood vessel walls by the oscillating microbubbles.","1948-5719","978-1-4673-4561-3","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562537","atomic force microscopy (AFM);blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening;mechanical stresses;microbubbles;stiffness","Acoustics;Force;Force measurement;Springs;Ultrasonic imaging;Young's modulus","Young's modulus;atomic force microscopy;biomedical ultrasonics;blood;blood vessels;brain;cavitation;drug delivery systems;elastic constants;gene therapy;neurophysiology;ultrasonic imaging","Young's modulus;atomic force microscopy;blood vessel walls;blood-brain barrier opening applications;cavitation-induced drug delivery;cavitation-induced gene delivery;contrast-enhanced acoustic bioeffects;diagnostic applications;microbubble elasticity;microbubble oscillation;microbubble surface;microstructures;nanoscale compressions;phospholipid-coated microbubbles;pressure 0.4 MPa to 2 MPa;shear stresses;size 4 mum to 8 mum;size-isolated microbubble stiffness;therapeutic applications","","0","","15","","","7-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we discuss these necessary timing overheads and present our approach to their analysis and reduction to a minimum value by the use of circuit techniques allowing completion detection. Transistor-level simulation results for an entirely delay-adaptable counter under variable supply down to 200 mV are presented. Additionally an analytical comparison and simulation of timing and energy consumption of more complex subthreshold asynchronous circuits is shown.

We propose a robust orientation field estimation algorithm (called the basic algorithm) for latent overlapped fingerprints whose core is the constrained relaxation labeling algorithm. We also propose improved versions of the basic algorithm for two special but frequent cases: 1) the mated template fingerprint of one component fingerprint is known and 2) the two component fingerprints are from the same finger. In both cases, further constraints are used to reduce ambiguity in relaxation labeling. Experimental results on both real and simulated overlapped fingerprints show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in both accuracy and efficiency. The two improved versions also perform better than the basic algorithm in respective cases. The latent overlapped fingerprint database collected for this study is made publicly available for performance evaluation.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215041","Overlapped fingerprints;minutiae;relaxation labeling;ridge extraction;singularity","Databases;Estimation;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Labeling;Robustness;Vectors","fingerprint identification;forensic science;image matching;natural scenes;visual databases","ambiguity reduction;constrained relaxation labeling algorithm;crime scenes;fingerprint matcher;fingerprint recognition;latent overlapped fingerprint database;latent overlapped fingerprint separation;performance evaluation;robust orientation field estimation algorithm","","6","","24","","2012-06-11","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Firstly, each frame of the video is segmented into regions which are more informative than pixels and image blocks. Then the saliency of each region is analyzed by combining static, motion and location attentions. Finally a region based saliency map is generated for each frame, and an attention score curve is obtained for the video clip by combining attention scores of all regions in each frame. Both of them can be utilized in wide applications. This method takes advantage of the properties of human visual perception and can well present the attention information of home videos.

The vortex generator consists of a cavity with a lightweight actuator plate. The actuator plate acts like a piston pumping air out of the cavity on the down-stroke and sucking air into the cavity on the upstroke. The actuator is placed asymmetrically over the cavity opening, forming narrow and wide slots when viewed from the top. The actuator depending on amplitude, frequency, and slot spacing produces several flow fields (free jet, wall jet, vortex flow). Computational simulation of the actuator-generated flows have been developed and applied to several actuator flow modes. This work should provide an impetus for designing similar active flow control systems suitable for aircraft applications. The computational simulation uses a time-accurate full Navier-Stokes (NS) solver known as FTNS3D (a full NS version of CFL3D solver). A multi-block moving grid has been developed and used for the computational study of the flow fields produced by the vortex generator. For three-dimensional computations, ten multi-block grids are used and for two-dimensional computations, six multi-block grids are used. The grid blocks adjacent to the actuator plate move with the plate motion, and second-order interpolation is used along the block interfaces.

As a result, the optimizer (which is typically a memory hog even on modest applications) must focus carefully on memory usage. On the opportunity side, hardware models tend to have much simpler control flow than do software applications. This permits a more efficient set of analysis techniques-techniques that are not possible in compilers for high level languages.

The performance comparison of these two controllers in both transient and steady state responses are also carried out in this paper. With the proposed control method, the DVR can compensate for the FRT, while the DFIG wind turbine can continue its normal operation as demanded in actual grid codes.

This trend presents a serious challenge for backup management and sets new requirements for performance efficiency of traditional backup and archival tools. In this work, we discuss potential performance shortcomings of the existing backup solutions. During a backup session a predefined set of objects (client filesystems) should be backed up. Traditionally, no information on the expected duration and throughput requirements of different backup jobs is provided. This may lead to an inefficient job schedule and the increased backup session time. We analyze historic data on backup processing from eight backup servers in HP Labs, and introduce two additional metrics associated with each backup job, called job duration and job throughput. Our goal is to use this additional information for automated design of a backup schedule that minimizes the overall completion time for a given set of backup jobs. This problem can be formulated as a resource constrained scheduling problem which is known to be NP-complete. Instead, we propose an efficient heuristics for building an optimized job schedule, called FlexLBF. The new job schedule provides a significant reduction in the backup time (up to 50%) and reduced resource usage (up to 2-3 times). Moreover, we design a simulation-based tool that aims to automate parameter tuning for avoiding manual configuration by system administrators while helping them to achieve nearly optimal performance.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990675","","Libraries;Processor scheduling;Servers;Throughput;Timing","back-up procedures;computational complexity;computer centres;scheduling;security of data","NP-complete;backup management;backup processing;backup schedule;backup servers;client filesystems;data protection solution;enterprise data centers;job duration;job management;job throughput;optimized job schedule;resource constrained scheduling problem;run-time performance optimization","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional methods used for analog validation of the power delivery system fall short in one or more of: a) Measurement accuracy in both frequency and time domains, especially for very high frequency noise caused by large di/dt events. The multi-GHz power supply noise attenuates very quickly away from the die. Conventional approaches of measuring the noise at the pins of the package or at the die using capacitive probes are not accurate for multi-GHz clocks. For this reason, the observability of high frequency on die noise has been very tricky. b) Implementation, e.g. delivery of analog references to multiple areas across a ""noisy"" die, and compactness/modularity of the measurement units. c) Automation to enable a timely volume of measurements. The efficiency of the measurements is key to correlating a particular speed path to poser supply noise. To address the above issues this paper presents an On-Die Droop Detector (ODDD), a scaleable IC solution implemented and validated on a 90 nm process, for analog sensing of differential high bandwidth supply noise.","","4-89114-034-8","","10.1109/VLSIC.2003.1221200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221200","","Detectors;Fluctuations;Frequency measurement;Integrated circuit noise;Microprocessors;Noise measurement;Pins;Power measurement;Power supplies;Time measurement","analogue integrated circuits;electric sensing devices;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;microcomputers;power supply circuits","90 nm;IC solution;analog sensing;capacitive probes;die droop detector;differential high bandwidth supply noise;frequency harmonics;microprocessor;package;power delivery system;power supply noise","","11","2","","","","12-14 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our main goal is to develop auto-tuning techniques for the GPU cluster. Monte Carlo or random sampling is a technique to optimise a fitness function by giving random values to function parameters. When execution of the fitness function requires a high amount of computational power Monte Carlo sampling becomes both very time and computational power consuming. A developer who is not familiar with the application, hardware, and the CUBA runtime cannot determine the optimal execution parameters. This makes GPU auto-tuning well suited to achieving better performance and reducing computing time.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449942","GPU computing;Monte Carlo;financial risks;high performance computing;optimisation","Graphics processing units;Optimization;Tuning","Monte Carlo methods;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;random processes;sampling methods","Monte Carlo optimisation;autotuning techniques;fitness function;multiGPU cluster;random sampling","","0","","10","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, the reconstructed image is normalized and unwrapped using Daugman rubber sheet model and its features are encoded using Gabor filters. Subsequently, the iris template generate using phase-quadrature demodulation scheme is indexed into the medical repository. Before intervention or medical procedures, the patient's identity is verified against the indexed iris templates using the Hamming Distance approach.

The ISyRAmI architecture considers the following four modules: data/information/knowledge acquisition; data/information/knowledge storage, conversion, and handling; intelligent reasoning; and decision support/intelligent actuation. However, because there is no security module in ISyRAmI, it was analyzed as weak by attacks like DDoS, sniffing, fake server, fake context, malicious code, DNS attacks, and routing attacks etc. For example, if the attackers send their fake contexts in ISyRAmI environment, some ISyRAmI devices may reply the bad information to users, i.e., to send their contents named as spam, to get userpsilas information by attackers fake server, sometimes, too many attackerpsilas contexts may lead to server down like damage of DDoS attacks, etc. Finally, these kinds of attacks make polluted results in ISyRAmI. ISyRAmI aims to support user next steps through an instantly adaptation to the dynamic environments, to achieve that is mandatory to include a security module in the ISyRAmI methodology and architecture.

In this regard, pneumatic rubber artificial muscles are of interest as actuators for these robots. However, the McKibben artificial muscle commonly used for this purpose have certain drawbacks. Instead, we developed a straight-fiber-type artificial muscle that surpasses the output and contraction ratio of the McKibben muscle. We also developed a seven degree of freedom manipulator actuated by straight-fiber-type artificial muscles. The main features of this manipulator are the differential gear mechanisms in the shoulder and elbow joints, and the pulley-in-pulley mechanism in the wrist joint. However, to make use these mechanisms, we had to address the issues present in existing manipulators. In addition, we carried out various calculations necessary to design a control system for this manipulator. We performed experiments to verify the performance of the manipulator and control system. We realized steady state position control of the manipulator. However, in the dynamic state, we observed an overshoot in the rise time of the step response and proposed a solution for this issue.","2159-6247","978-1-4673-5319-9","","10.1109/AIM.2013.6584108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584108","","Control systems;Gears;Joints;Manipulator dynamics;Muscles;Pulleys","control system synthesis;electroactive polymer actuators;manipulator dynamics;pneumatic actuators;position control","7-DOF manipulator development;McKibben artificial muscle;control system design;differential gear mechanisms;dynamic state;elbow joint;housework;nursing;operating characteristics;output-contraction ratio;pneumatic rubber artificial muscles;pulley-in-pulley mechanism;robot actuator;shoulder joint;steady state position control;step response;straight-fiber-type pneumatic artificial muscle;wrist joint","","1","","19","","","9-12 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a fully automatic expression insensitive 3-D face recognition system. Surface deformations due to facial expressions are a major problem in 3-D face recognition. The proposed approach deals with such challenging conditions in several aspects. First, we employ a fast and accurate region-based registration scheme that uses common region models. These common models make it possible to establish correspondence to all the gallery samples in a single registration pass. Second, we utilize curvature-based 3-D shape descriptors. Last, we apply statistical feature extraction methods. Since all the 3-D facial features are regionally registered to the same generic facial component, subspace construction techniques may be employed. We show that linear discriminant analysis significantly boosts the identification accuracy. We demonstrate the recognition ability of our system using the multiexpression Bosphorus and the most commonly used 3-D face database, Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGCv2). Our experimental results show that in both databases we obtain comparable performance to the best rank-1 correct classification rates reported in the literature so far: 98.19% for the Bosphorus and 97.51% for the FRGCv2 database. We have also carried out the standard receiver operating characteristics (ROC III) experiment for the FRGCv2 database. At an FAR of 0.1%, the verification performance was 86.09%. This shows that model-based registration is beneficial in identification scenarios where speed-up is important, whereas for verification one-to-one registration can be more beneficial.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2054081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492213","Biometrics;curvature descriptors (CDs);three-dimensional (3-D) face recognition;three-dimensional (3-D) registration","Biological materials;Biometrics;Databases;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Geometry;Humans;Iris;Linear discriminant analysis;Security","face recognition;feature extraction;image registration","3D face database;3D facial feature;biometric identification;curvature-based 3D shape descriptor;expression resistant 3D face recognition;face recognition grand challenge;facial expression;fully automatic expression insensitive 3D face recognition system;gallery sample;generic facial component;high security application;linear discriminant analysis;model-based registration;multiexpression Bosphorus;region model;region-based registration;regional registration;statistical feature extraction;subspace construction technique;surface deformation;three-dimensional facial surface characteristics","","18","","40","","2010-06-28","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed controller guarantees that the position, velocity and currents tracking errors globally exponentially converge to zero. Furthermore, the proposed controller is robust against the load torque. By using passive properties of PMSMs, the requirements of the velocity and current measurements were removed.

In such a situation, a method using an IC card that stores unique user information has been widely used. Until recently, the security of communication between an IC card and a client has not been a critical concern because contact type IC cards have been used in most cases. However, now that non-contact type IC cards are expected to be spreading in the near future, secure communication between an IC card and a client is considered to become a serious concern. Although there exists a method whereby all IC cards and clients use a common key to realize secure communication, there is a concern that secret information is easily leaked from the client terminal. To solve this problem, we propose in this study a protocol called ""SPAIC"". Presuming that a non-contact type IC card is used, SPAIC can deliver the important information from a server to a client that has no initial information so that there exists no risk of information leakage.","","978-1-4244-0976-1","978-1-4244-0977-8","10.1109/ISCIT.2007.4392247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4392247","","Authentication;Information technology;Proposals","client-server systems;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;telecommunication security","SPAIC;authentication method;client-server system;encryption;information leakage;noncontact type IC card;protocol;secure communication","","1","","18","","","17-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, random number generation is one of the most critical primitives for cryptography. This paper focuses on true random number generators (TRNGs) and the analysis of their security requirements. After illustrating issues associated with adversarial influences on TRNGs, we propose a simple method to obtain a secure TRNG based on n TRNGs originating from (potentially) untrusted vendors. The untrusted generators are combined such that as long as one out of the n vendors does not collude with the other vendors, the generator is secure, i.e., the output is unpredictable and uniformly distributed even in the presence of an active attacker. In order to achieve this, we review several choices of functions to be used as combiner. The advantage of our design is that only the (black-box) input-output behavior of the vendor's TRNGs needs to be evaluated. No overhead is introduced by the combiner. The resulting generator offers faultresilience and ease of maintenance.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883406","Attacks on TRNGs;Cryptography;Fault-tolerance;Hardware Trojans;Random Number Generator (RNG);Resilient functions","Boolean functions;Correlation;Cryptography;Entropy;Generators;Noise","cryptography;random number generation","TRNGs;active attacker;cryptographic random number generation;fault resilience;true random number generators;untrusted generators","","0","","28","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this kind of retrieval system, the domain ontology is used as the backbone of the searching process. However, with the heterogeneity of data storing formats on the Web, many of ontology-driven systems development approach suffer from inconsistencies during mapping between ontologypsilas concepts and corresponding data from data sources. Thus, sophisticated data integration and mining tools are required so domain scientists can more easily retrieve answers to their queries. To address these requirements, we have proposed a Web content query refinement framework integrating both ontology and Web mining techniques to assist the material domain scientists. We used the Web ontology language (OWL) to represent structured knowledge about materials. We have used SWRL, the semantic Web rule language, as a high-level query language that uses the implemented OWL based mappings method. The main merit of our proposed solution is that the user can interactively process (accept or reject) the knowledge gathered during the mining process to enrich the ontology base (ontology learning), which leads to better query precision. We present an evaluation study using Query&Navi, to show the benefit of the proposed approach.","","978-0-7695-3766-5","","10.1109/GCC.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279544","OntoTWO;Ontology;query refinement;search engine;web content mining","Distributed computing;Grid computing;Image databases;Information retrieval;Network servers;OWL;Ontologies;Prototypes;Refining;Semantic Web","data mining;knowledge representation languages;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);query formulation;query languages;search engines;semantic Web;user interfaces","OWL;Query&Navi;SWRL;Web content query refinement framework;Web mining;Web ontology language;data integration;data mining;data storage format;distributed environment;high-level query language;information retrieval;ontology learning;query answering;search engine;semantic Web rule language;semantic content searching;systems development approach;user interaction","","1","","18","","","27-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the envelope of the high-frequency clock can be followed by accurately computing the circuit behavior over occasional cycles.

In the projective grid space as a general space that is related to all images, a projective shape can be reconstructed from all the images of weakly calibrated cameras. The projective reconstruction is one way to reduce the effort of the calibration because it does not need Euclid metric information, but rather only correspondences of several points between the images.

While the optimal power allocation solution has a ""water-filling"" type structure, the optimal channel assignment problem is very challenging due to the non-linear dependence of user throughput on the set of channels assigned to it. Since the optimal channel allocations is computationally intensive to obtain in general, we analyze the system in the two extremal SINR regimes (very high and very low SINR) and show how the optimal solutions can be obtained in these regimes in a computationally efficient manner.

The results of the tests have shown that the tribo-film deposited on the slip ring adapts rapidly to changing operating conditions such as current load.

Tree parallel multipliers are the fastest ones. The only disadvantage of tree multipliers over serial multipliers is its high cost in terms of area and power dissipation. In this paper, we present a new efficient reduction scheme to implement tree multipliers on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in a way that is more suitable for the lookup tables (LUTs) structure in FPGAs. The scheme is based on using a library of m.n counters. The aim of this scheme is to minimize the number of reduction steps to maximize reduction ratio which in turn reduces area and delay. A script was written to automate Verilog code generation according to the proposed scheme. Simulation and synthesis were conducted using Xilinx ISE suite. Results show that our scheme needs 13.4% and 32.6% less LUTs than the well-known Dadda and Wallace reduction tree schemes, respectively. Also, the delay is less by 44.8% and 52.8% than Dadda and Wallace schemes, respectively.","","","","10.1109/IDT.2014.7038609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038609","Verilog HDL;carry-save adder (CSA);compressor tree;field programmable gate array (FPGA);lookup table (LUT);parallel muliplier;reduction tree;tree multiplier","Adders;Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware design languages;Radiation detectors;Table lookup;Vegetation","field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;multiplying circuits;trees (mathematics)","FPGA;Verilog code generation;Xilinx ISE suite;field programmable gate arrays;reduction ratio;reduction scheme;tree multipliers","","0","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A wavelet decomposition model provides the predictions. The results obtained for the healthy group were substantially higher than those of the pathologic groups.

The gradient domain method can bring the contrasts of multiple images to the same level while the improved singular value equalization can make their intensity means close to each other.

The approach is implementable for large systems if certain approximations are used. A simulation study shows that the algorithm converges in two iterations, exhibits good traffic efficiency, and provides a flexible tool for performance allocation among services.

Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) have been observed in a high average power gyrotron and the trapped electron population contributing to the oscillation has been measured. As high average power gyrotrons are the most promising millimeter wave source for thermonuclear fusion research, it is important to get a better understanding of this parasitic phenomenon to avoid any deterioration of the electron beam quality thus reducing the gyrotron efficiency. 2D Particle-in-cell simulations quasi-statically modeled the development of oscillations of the space charge in the adiabatic trap, but the physics of the electron dynamics in the adiabatic trap was only partially understood. Therefore, understanding of the LFOs remains incomplete and a full picture of this parasitic phenomenon has not been seen yet. In this work, we use a 3D conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) particle-in-cell (PIC) method to accurately and efficiently study the LFOs in a high average power gyrotron. As the CFDTD method exhibits a second order accuracy, complicated structures, such as a magnetron injection gun (MIG), can be well described. Employing a highly parallelized computation, the model can be simulated in time domain more realistically. LFOs have been obtained in a 3D time domain simulation for the first time. From our preliminary simulation studies, it is found that not only magnetic compression profile but initial velocity or velocity ratio play an important role in the operation of a MIG electron gun. Detailed results will be presented.","0730-9244","978-1-61284-330-8","978-1-61284-328-5","10.1109/PLASMA.2011.5993004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993004","","Gyrotrons;Three dimensional displays","finite difference methods;finite difference time-domain analysis;gyrotrons;plasma oscillations;plasma simulation;plasma sources;plasma transport processes;space charge;time-domain analysis","2D Particle-in-cell simulation;3D CFDTD PIC method;3D time domain simulation;MIG electron gun;electron beam quality;finite-difference time-domain particle-in-cell method;gyrotron;low-frequency oscillations;magnetic compression;magnetron injection gun;parallelized computation;parasitic phenomenon;space charge;thermonuclear fusion research;trapped electron population","","0","","","","","26-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, the centers of the clusters which are formed by the received samples are estimated, in a computationally efficient manner, that exploits the channel linearity and the symmetries underlying the transmitted signal constellation. This paper investigates the relationship of the center estimation (CE) part of the proposed equalizer with the Least Squares (LS) method, demonstrating that it can attain LS performance at a substantially lower computational cost. The importance of CE is thus confirmed, as a methodology that combines high performance, simplicity and low computational cost, as required in a practical equalization task. The results of this paper provide also an alternative, algebraic viewpoint on the CE method, while at the same time leading to a new interpretation of the LS, in terms of averaging for cluster center estimation.","","978-320-0001-65-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7080027","","Abstracts;Estimation;Lead;Least squares approximations","channel estimation;equalisers;least squares approximations;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;pattern clustering;transient response","CE method;LS method;channel impulse response;cluster center estimation least squares performance;clustering-based MLSE equalization;maximum likelihood sequence estimation equalizer","","0","","","","","6-10 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When DC voltage was applied, metallic ions from end terminations of the MLC would migrate along the condensed water film on the MLC surface and made a permanent short-circuiting path between two terminations. Silver and tin migrations were found by EDX detection in our experiment. It was also found that the applied DC electrical loading level had a strong influence on the fail rate of MLCs.

These equations are used to study mechanical effects on the thickness-shear (TS), flexural (F), and face-shear (FS) vibrations of an AT-cut quartz plated with two identical electrodes. Dispersion curves are calculated from the present 2D equations as well as the 3D equations. The comparison of these curves shows that the agreement is very close for all three frequency branches of TS, F, and FS modes in a range up to 1.5 times the fundamental TS frequency and for gold and aluminum electrodes with R, the ratio of the mass of the electrodes to that of the plate, equal to 0.05, without introducing any correction factors. In order to assess electrode effects, spectra of /spl Omega/ vs. a/b/sub q/ (length-to-thickness ratio of the quartz) are computed for plates with gold and aluminum electrodes and different R ratios.

Shannon famously considered a scheme that instantaneously samples the signal at equispaced times. He proved that the signal can be reconstructed as long as the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth (Nyquist rate). Candès, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires instantaneous samples of the signal at random times. They proved that the signal can be uniquely and efficiently reconstructed, provided the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, times logarithmic factors. In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal, and a sampling scheme inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory. Namely, we propose to acquire non-instantaneous samples at random times. Mathematically, this is implemented by acquiring a small random subset of Gabor coefficients. We show empirically that this scheme achieves correct reconstruction as soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.","2157-8095","978-1-4673-2580-6","978-1-4673-2578-3","10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283951","","Compressed sensing;Couplings;Information theory;Message passing;Sensors;Standards;Vectors","probability;random codes;random processes;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","Gabor coefficient;Nyquist rate;Shannon scheme;coding theory;frequency domain sparse support;information theoretically optimal rate;random signal sampling scheme;signal probabilistic model;signal reconstruction;spatial coupling idea;time logarithmic factor","","5","","18","","","1-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most attractive applications of MPLS is traffic engineering (TE), However, MPLS by itself cannot provide service differentiation, which brings up the need to complement it with another technology capable of providing such a feature: DiffServ. By mapping the traffic from different DiffServ classes of service on separate LSPs(light switched paths) networks can meet engineering constraints specific to the given class on both shortest and non-shortest path. This TE strategy is called DiffServ-aware TE (DS-TE).

A bit loading analysis for power line channels over the considered DSL bandwidth of 30 MHz has been presented assuming the Transmit power spectral densities as for ADSL and VDSL2 used in telephone lines.

We quantify the performance differences between the two receivers, allowing system designers and operators to determine when the less complex narrow filter receiver might be the appropriate choice. We numerically optimize the 3-dB bandwidth and center frequency of the narrow filter and show it is more robust to carrier frequency detuning than the conventional solution. We show that the narrow filter receiver is more tolerant to chromatic dispersion (CD) than the conventional one, and equally tolerant to first-order polarization-mode dispersion. We show the impact of the 3-dB bandwidth on the receiver performance when CD accumulates. Finally, we show via experiments and simulations that the 3 dB advantage of the conventional receiver vanishes when the nonlinear impairments are fiber nonlinearities; comparing the two receivers at the optimum launch power for a 25 times 80 km system, the difference in optical SNR margin is reduced to ~1.6 dB.

Hence, in order to improve detector systems, there is the necessity to develop multiplexing techniques to keep the number of wires in the cryogenic environment as low as possible. We realized a readout circuit with rapid single flux quantum electronics. All detector output signals were merged to a single output channel. This leads to a loss of spatial resolution of the information provided by the single pixels. In order to overcome this effect, this work describes a theoretical analysis of time and code multiplexing technique for arrays of SNSPDs and a comparison concerning their applicability in different cases.

However, current Web service management systems do not provide a holistic view of Web services. These management systems use independent information models covering different aspects of Web services, for instance, QoS, licensing, taxonomy information, to name just a few. In this paper, we address the challenges of (1) integrating available information into a common Web service information model, while (2) providing an extensible information model, and at the same time, (3) keeping track of Web services changes and (4) offering means for complex analysis of Web services. We introduce a Service Evolution Management Framework (SEMF) that addresses the aforementioned challenges using a generic Web service information model.

The question is how to run multi-dimensional Lipschitz Global Optimization in parallel, such that the implementation depending on the used platform is efficient. Previous work shows a parallel version developed for multicore nodes with two levels of parallelism: intra-node and inter-node. On intra-node level, one can perform dynamic load balancing by generating threads dynamically. Threads end when they complete their assigned work. The inter-node level carries out a static load balancing using MPI. In general, algorithm design depends on the characteristics of problems to be solved. There are several ways to improve performance of general parallel B&B algorithms. Specifically, we are interested in how to apply them to parallel Lipschitz Global Optimization algorithms. Operations like selecting the next subproblem to be evaluated become critical in parallel B&B schemes. We study Depth and Hybrid (Best-Depth) options as selection criterion. Previous work, using only MPI or OpenMP, discard not only the broadcasting of the best found upper bound of the solution due to its high average cost/performance but also the use of dynamic load balancing. Here we check how broadcasting the upper bound affects the developed MPI-Pthreads algorithm. Additionally, we study how to perform dynamic load balancing at inter-node level. Experimental results show which designs perform better on which type of instances for the used computational architecture.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681279","Lipschitz optimization;branch-and-bound;distributed computing;dynamic load balancing;global optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Instruction sets;Load management;Memory management;Message systems;Optimization","application program interfaces;message passing;optimisation;parallel algorithms;resource allocation;tree searching","MPI;MPI-Pthreads algorithm;depth and hybrid options;dynamic load balancing;exhaustive search;general parallel B&B algorithms;hierarchical load-balancing techniques;inter-node level;intra-node level;multidimensional Lipschitz global optimization algorithm;parallel branch-and-bound methods;static load balancing","","0","","21","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, pipelined hardware implementation of these algorithms has two disadvantages: (1) backtracking which requires stalling the pipeline and (2) inefficient memory usage due to variation in the size of the trie nodes. We propose a clustering algorithm that can partition a given rule database into a fixed number of clusters to eliminate back-tracking in the state-of-the-art hierarchical search structures. Furthermore, we develop a novel ternary trie data structure (T<sub>∈</sub>). In T<sub>∈</sub> structure, the size of the trie nodes is fixed by utilizing ∈-branch property, which overcomes the memory inefficiency problems in the pipelined hardware implementation of hierarchical search structures. We design a two-stage hierarchical search structure consisting of binary search trees in Stage 1, and T<sub>∈</sub> structures in Stage 2. Our approach demonstrates a substantial reduction in the memory footprint compared with that of the state-of-the-art. For all publicly available databases, the achieved memory efficiency is between 10.37 and 22.81 bytes of memory per rule. State-of-the-art designs can only achieve the memory efficiency of over 23 byte/rule in the best case. We also propose a SRAM-based linear pipelined architecture for packet classification that achieves high throughput. Using a state-of-the-art FPGA, the proposed design can sustain a 418 million packets per second throughput or 134 Gbps (for the minimum packet size of 40 Bytes). Additionally, our design maintains packet input order and supports in-place non-blocking rule updates.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195565","","Clustering algorithms;Data structures;Hardware;IP networks;Partitioning algorithms;Silicon;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;tree data structures","∈-branch property;FPGA;SRAM;backtracking;binary search trees;clustering algorithm;hierarchical hybrid search structure;high performance packet classification;linear pipelined architecture;memory footprint;memory inefficiency problem;memory usage;multicore network processor;pipelined hardware;rule database;ternary trie data structure","","3","","23","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the heart of the ASIC is a highly flexible RAKE processing engine that utilizes a unique resource allocation technique for maximum flexibility. The front-end of the chip consists of a matched filter and an all digital timing and frequency recovery loop based on interpolation and direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) techniques. A highly configurable multipath combiner is used to generate the final demodulated symbols by combining contributions from different multipath in a maximal ratio combining scheme. The combiner is also instrumental in performing channel estimation/correction and in closing the loop on the timing and frequency recovery circuits. The chip also features a multipath searcher which performs an energy scan of the wireless channel to decide on new valid multipath. To minimize power consumption and enhance the flexibility of the architecture a unique data tagging technique is utilized to decouple the sampling rate of the incoming data from the processing frequency of different blocks of the ASIC. All resources are programmable via a microcontroller interface that provides firmware control over system resources. Furthermore, the architecture supports the concept of design reuse by enabling simple modular expansion as a means of increasing resources. The resulting layout area is 8.29 mm<sup>2</sup> in a 0.18-μm 1-poly 6-metal CMOS process and consists of 320000 equivalent gates. The core consumes a total of 4.032 mW in a typical load scenario including full demodulation of two RAKE fingers and simultaneous searching for new multipath.","0018-9200","","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.831466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317056","ASIC;CDMA;DDFS;Farrow;G cellular;RAKE receiver;direct digital frequency synthesis;filters;interpolation;low power;resource allocation","Application specific integrated circuits;Diversity reception;Fading;Frequency synthesizers;Heart;Multiaccess communication;Multipath channels;Resource management;Technological innovation;Timing","3G mobile communication;CMOS digital integrated circuits;application specific integrated circuits;code division multiple access;direct digital synthesis;diversity reception;low-power electronics;microcontrollers;radio receivers;resource allocation;spread spectrum communication","0.18 micron;3G cellular radio;4.032 mW;ASIC;CMOS;DS-CDMA-based system;RAKE processing engine;RAKE receiver;architectural innovations;channel correction;channel estimation;data tagging;design reuse;digital timing;direct digital frequency synthesis;firmware control;frequency recovery circuits;frequency recovery loop;front-end processor;interpolation;microcontroller interface;multipath combiner;multipath searcher;power consumption;resource allocation;system resources","","5","2","7","","","Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It exploits the spatial correlation between the neighboring blocks to select several codewords that are very close to the encoding block from the master codebook. But if the block boundary is in the region edge area, the spatial correlations are not high and the SMVQ can't select proper codewords to encode blocks. An entropy-constrained gradient-match VQ (ECGMVQ) is proposed. Instead of exploiting the spatial correlation, the ECGMVQ uses the gradient contiguity property to select the codewords. The state function of ECGMVQ can select better codevectors than the SMVQ. In addition, the entropy-constrained rule is applied to the encoding process to reduce the bit rate. Simulation results show that the improvement of ECGMVQ over the SMVQ is up to 4-5 dB at nearly the same bit rate.

However, before the adoption of purely asynchronous strategies in VLSI design, globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) design approaches should take over. The design of circuits using complex field programmable components like state of the art FPGAs follows this same trend. In GALS design, a critical step is the definition of asynchronous interfaces between synchronous regions. This paper proposes SCAFFI, a new asynchronous interface to interconnect modules inside FPGAs. The interface is based on clock stretching techniques to avoid metastability. Differently from other interfaces, it can use both logic levels for stretching and do not require the use of arbiters. Also, compactness of the implementation is enhanced by the use of dedicated FPGA hard macros. A GALS version implementation of an RSA cryptography core demonstrates the use of SCAFFI.","1063-6404","978-1-4244-1257-0","978-1-4244-1258-7","10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601950","","Asynchronous circuits;Clocks;Delay;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Metastasis;Proposals;Protocols;Synchronization;Very large scale integration","VLSI;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;network synthesis","FPGAs;GALS;RSA cryptography core;SCAFFI;VLSI design;clock stretching techniques;field programmable gate arrays;globally asynchronous, locally synchronous design;hard macros;intrachip FPGA asynchronous interface;synchronous VLSI circuits","","11","","13","","","7-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Former modelling results showed that it should be possible to reach efficiencies in excess of 18% although using an opaque as a substrate and no light trapping schemes. However, silicon layers grown by LPE on suitable low cost substrates such as low-grade multicrystalline silicon are often very rough, making the processing of the layers difficult. We have used of a modified LPE technique which incorporates intermittent meltback into the growth process to grow silicon on cast multicrystalline wafers. The use of this technique has resulted in a significantly improved surface morphology, as was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. This improvement can be explained by considering the transport of solute in the melt during the growth and meltback stages. Solar cells fabricated on these layers have achieved efficiencies up to 15.4%, despite the absence of any light confinement. The results also indicate that further performance boosts up to 17% are possible through further refinement of the cell processing techniques","","0-7803-3374-8","","10.1109/COMMAD.1996.610050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=610050","","Costs;Epitaxial growth;Photovoltaic cells;Rough surfaces;Semiconductor films;Semiconductor process modeling;Silicon;Substrates;Surface roughness;Temperature","elemental semiconductors;liquid phase epitaxial growth;semiconductor epitaxial layers;silicon;solar cells","15.4 percent;Si;conversion efficiency;liquid phase epitaxy;meltback;multicrystalline silicon solar cell;photovoltaic material;scanning electron microscopy;solute transport;surface morphology;thin film growth","","0","","4","","","8-11 Dec 1996","08 Dec 1996-11 Dec 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As our systems communicate more and more with other that we know less and less, they become increasingly vulnerable to hostile intruders who may take advantage of the very protocols intended for the establishment and authentication of communication to tie up our resources and disable our servers. Since these attacks occur before parties are authenticated to each other. Proxy network based defense has recently emerged to address an open research challenge-protecting Internet service application from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Such schemes use a proxy network as a mediator for a hidden application to prevent direct attacks on the applicationpsilas physical infrastructure, while maintaining communication between users and the application. The proxy network provides a distributed front-end to disperse DoS attack traffic, thereby shielding the application. However, the basic feasibility and fundamental properties of such schemes remain unclear, posing critical challenges for their use. Resisting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is an important open research. This work explores the use of overlay proxy networks to protect applications against DoS attacks. The analysis shows that proxy network-based DoS defense can effectively resist these attacks and protect application successfully.","","978-1-4244-3334-6","","10.1109/ICCET.2009.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4769624","denial-of-service;distributed denial-of-service;network security","Authentication;Computer crime;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Queueing analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","communication authentication;denial-of-service attacks;distributed front-end;hostile intruders;overlay proxy networks;queuing analysis","","0","","13","","","22-24 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the existence of a number of statistical and soft computing methodologies for stock market forecasting, there is still need for an efficient and accurate forecasting model for this purpose. Although a wide range of nature inspired evolutionary algorithms have been developed and applied successfully in the domain of stock market forecasting, their performance may vary significantly from one stock market to another. Therefore selection of an algorithm involves an inherit risk associated with it. In this paper, instead of employing a single algorithm and investing the total time budget in it, we construct a cooperative algorithm framework, which takes two algorithms as its constituent algorithms. Particularly two population-based algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and chemical reaction optimization (CRO) have been chosen as the constituent algorithms. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture have been used as the forecasting model. The cooperative algorithm framework executes each constituent algorithm with a part of the entire computation time budget and encourages interaction between them, so that they can benefit from one other. The cooperative algorithms have evaluated on five fast growing real stock market data set consisting daily closing prices.

We also propose an architecture of a reader-tag system that addresses the underlying technical challenges. The rectifier is based on a differential drive cross-coupled topology that has been shown to work at UHF frequencies only so far. In this paper, we investigate significant challenges in implementing this topology at millimeter-wave frequencies with good power conversion efficiency (PCE). The analyses, design, and results presented in this work demonstrate the feasibility of achieving this by minimizing simultaneously the small on-resistance and the reverse leakage current in the MOS transistors, and by reducing losses and parasitic capacitances through proper transistor sizing and layout optimization. Using a standard 65-nm bulk CMOS process, a chip was designed, fabricated, and tested under different input and output loading conditions. The rectifier exhibits an overall PCE of 20% at 24 GHz, 18% at 35 GHz, and 11% at 60 GHz under RF available driving power of 6, 6, and 3 dBm, respectively, and output load resistance of 1, 1, and 2 kΩ, respectively.

This NBC-MPSK scheme was generalized to multiple-antenna systems in [2] as well. In this paper, we present further research results on NBC-MPSK and its generalization. We first focus on the rotational invariance (RI) of NBC-MPSK. Based on the RI property of NBC-MPSK with multistage decoding, a noncoherent near-optimal linear-complexity multistage decoder for NBC-MPSK is proposed. Then we propose a tree-search ML decoding algorithm for NBC-MPSK. The proposed algorithm is shown to have low complexity and excellent error performance. This ML decoding algorithm can also be applied to the generalized NBC-MPSK for multiple antennas. In addition, we propose a new signal set with partitioning for the generalized NBC-MPSK. Error performance and complexity of decoding algorithms is verified by simulations.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.254916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024308","","Baseband;Block codes;Constellation diagram;Decoding;Detectors;Differential phase shift keying;Differential quadrature phase shift keying;Partitioning algorithms;Phase detection;Space time codes","","","","1","","22","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to lack of accurate information, availabilities of some components may not be known during establishment of restoration strategies after a blackout. In this paper, a novel risk-based methodology is proposed for constructing restoration strategies with stochastic availability constraints for both individual components and restoration paths. Based on a stochastic model of the availability, a multistage stochastic optimization model is constructed. A bi-level method is used to solve the proposed model. The established restoration strategy is to achieve a reasonable restoration duration subjects to operating constraints and acceptable risk levels. The proposed risk constraints are introduced into the EPRI's System Restoration Navigator (SRN) with a little modification.

The proposed approach enables a more practical implementation of distributed context-aware broadcasting, which requires no global information and only partial synchronization.

IEEE","20020806","1999","2","","1244","1247 vol.2","Owing to simplicity, polarization purity, power capacity, good match, and low cost, the use of a coaxially fed monopole in a parallel plate waveguide is an attractive option as an adapter or a feed and has been extensively investigated for years. However, a simple coaxially fed linear monopole particularly offers a narrow impedance bandwidth. So some modified monopoles have been often applied to wireless communication antennas in the past decades. The input impedance performance has been significantly improved by means of the various loading techniques, such as dielectric coatings, attached dielectric resonator structures, and disc-ended or top-hat structures. Previously, an alternative is a leaky-mode aperture-coupled dielectric resonator, which has been successfully used as a feed of a class of omnidirectional antennas suitable for wireless communication systems. In this article, a novel sleeve monopole type is proposed to further improve the impedance performance of a monopole. This structure simply consists of a second sleeve and a sleeve monopole vertically put between a parallel plate waveguide. Compared to traditional structures used in a parallel plate waveguide, this modified sleeve monopole has the merit of noticeably broad impedance bandwidth and still maintains the feature of simple structure, low cost, and pure polarization. Because of simple manufacture, broad bandwidth, and good match, this novel structure has shown a promising potential application in various microwave applications and wireless/satellite communications.","","0-7803-5639-x","","10.1109/APS.1999.789539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=789539","","Aperture antennas;Bandwidth;Coatings;Coaxial components;Costs;Dielectric resonator antennas;Feeds;Impedance measurement;Polarization;Wireless communication","antenna feeds;electric impedance;microwave antennas;monopole antennas;parallel plate waveguides;satellite antennas","broad impedance bandwidth;coaxially fed linear monopole;dielectric coatings;dielectric resonator structures;impedance bandwidth;input impedance performance;leaky-mode aperture-coupled dielectric resonator;loading techniques;microwave applications;omnidirectional antennas;parallel plate waveguide;polarization purity;power capacity;sleeve monopole;wireless communication antennas;wireless/satellite communications","","1","","7","","","11-16 July 1999","11 Jul 1999-16 Jul 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Do expert swing dancers physically optimize their pose for a partnered spin? In a partnered spin, two dancers connect hands and spin as a unit around a single vertical axis. We describe the pose of a couple by the angles of their joints in a two-dimensional plane and compare expert and novice dancers' actual poses to the approximately ideal poses generated from a biomechanical optimization model. The optimization objective is to maximize rotational acceleration, by minimizing the resistance to spin, but still producing torque. The model considers only external forces and neglects internal forces. It consists of equations derived from physical principles such as Newton's laws and moment of inertia calculations. Using numerical non-linear optimization we find the pose for each couple that maximizes their rotational acceleration. Different dancers are differently sized, so every couple has a unique optimal pose. Each couple's optimal pose is compared to the pose they actually assumed for the spin. We used motion capture to determine the angles of the joints in the couple's actual pose. The couple's actual pose is used to calculate a predicted rotational acceleration. This predicted acceleration is then compared to the optimal acceleration to determine a fraction of optimal for each couple. We hypothesized that expert swing dancers would achieve a higher fraction of their optimal acceleration than beginners. Our results did not achieve statistical significance with a simplified model and a small sample of 10 couples.","0743-1619","978-1-4577-0080-4","","10.1109/ACC.2011.5990892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990892","","Acceleration;Foot;Force;Hip;Joints;Mathematical model;Optimization","acceleration;biomechanics;gait analysis;optimisation;torque","Lindy hop partnered spin;Newton laws;biomechanical optimization model;moment of inertia calculations;numerical nonlinear optimization;pose selection;rotational acceleration maximization;torque production","","0","","7","","","June 29 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the time, such a cable would have been capable of carrying half the entire electric power generated in the United States, and about one-tenth today. This paper will revisit their vision in the context of the subsequent discovery of high temperature superconductivity twenty years later, and the now emerging availability of long lengths of high performance wire and tape for operation in the 20-80 K range. Whereas the scenario set by Garwin and Matisoo addressed the one-way transmission of electricity from remote coal and nuclear generation multi-plant ""farms"" to large population centers, we will extend their picture to include two-way transmission on a diurnal or longer period to take advantage of regional electricity pricing and production which has resulted from the deregulation of generation. We conclude that the advent of high temperature superconductivity substantially extends and brings closer both the technical and economic feasibility of Garwin and Matisoo's dream. However, we note, as did they, the caveat that ""whether it is desirable or necessary is another matter entirely."" We believe this question will be decided in the affirmative as societal demands continue to increase for the clean, reliable and ecologically gentle delivery of large amounts of electric power, a need that was foreseen but not as overriding forty years ago as it is now.","1051-8223","","","10.1109/TASC.2007.899981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277417","DC power transmission;high-temperature superconductors;superconducting cables","Helium;High temperature superconductors;Niobium;Nuclear power generation;Power generation;Proposals;Refrigeration;Superconducting cables;Superconductivity;Tin","high-temperature superconductors;power transmission economics;superconducting cables","cable system;deregulation;electric power generation;electrical power transmission;high temperature superconductivity;one-way transmission;regional electricity pricing;superconducting lines","","1","","21","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The impedance matrix localization method (IML) developed by Canning [199] constitutes a different method for speeding up MOM matrix-vector multiplications. The IML is designed for objects that are smooth on the scale of the wavelength, and relies on a transformation that numerically sparsifies the MOM matrix. This is achieved by using basis functions that radiate strongly in preferred directions. In this paper, a hybrid IML-FMM (fast multipole method) technique is presented. The IML is used to sparsify the FMM far-field transformation matrices to further speed up the MOM matrix-vector multiplication. Although the proposed method does not decrease the rate of scaling of the computational cost, it does significantly reduce the actual cost associated with the solution of many practical 2D scattering problems. Furthermore, a windowed translation operator is also used, yielding an efficient O(N/sup 4/3/) FMM code for analyzing scattering from 2D perfect electrically conducting surfaces.","","0-7803-5639-x","","10.1109/APS.1999.789215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=789215","","Acceleration;Computational efficiency;Costs;Electromagnetic scattering;Impedance;Integral equations;Magnetic analysis;Matrix decomposition;Message-oriented middleware;Sparse matrices","electromagnetic wave scattering;impedance matrix;matrix multiplication;method of moments","2D objects;2D perfect electrically conducting surfaces;IML;MOM matrix-vector multiplication;MOM matrix-vector multiplications;basis functions;computational cost;electromagnetic scattering;far-field transformation matrices;fast multipole acceleration;fast multipole method;impedance matrix localization;moment method;windowed translation operator","","0","","6","","","11-16 July 1999","11 Jul 1999-16 Jul 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For lysing of Eschericia coli, this tendency has been proven to hold for pulsewidths as short as 60 ns. For macroorganisms, however, it was found that for pulsewidths of less than 5 μs, the tendency is reversed: the energy required to affect the macroorganisms increases again.

We all know that the biggest threat to the availability of internet is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The objective of DDoS attack is to consume the target's resources to such an extent that it becomes incapable to serve legitimate clients. Till date, a wide variety of solutions have been proposed to solve this problem but a very few of them concentrate on protecting critical infrastructures. Secure Overlay Services (SOS) architecture acts as a basis to protect all these time critical applications. It proactively prevents the target by providing layers of security between the authenticated client and the protected target. Although SOS architecture is successful in complicating the job of attacker, but still it is vulnerable to various attacks. Various researchers critically study this architecture and discuss various attacks possible on it. The aim of this paper is to review various attacks possible on this architecture so that more detailed understanding of attacker's strategy can be achieved and use this knowledge to develop more robust solutions.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449864","Overlay;SOS;attacks;intelligent attacker","Servers","Internet;client-server systems;computer network security;message authentication;overlay networks;software architecture","DDoS attack;Internet;SOS architecture;authenticated client;critical analysis;critical infrastructures;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate clients;protected target;secure overlay services;time critical applications","","0","","13","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To sort the palette, a measure for color similarity is needed. Here an l<sub>2</sub> distance in the RGB and luminance-chrominance color space has been studied, and a new color correlation measure is proposed.

Generalized Transfer Function (GTF) is the most widely used approach for solving this problem, which adopts an average population model to describe the relationship between the BPs at the central and peripheral locations. In this paper, we compare the performance of two GTF-based methods of central BP reconstruction. In these methods, the central BP is reconstructed using the upper extremity arterial BP measurements, and the propagation process of BP from the aorta to the upper-limb peripheral site is described using the traditional transmission line (TTL) model and the segmented transmission line (STL) model, respectively. The two models were tested using leave-one-out cross-validation on 8 sets of simulated data. The results demonstrated that STL-based method performed better than the TTL-based method. The underlying reason for the improved performance is that, the STL-based method better describes the pervasive wave reflection effects in the upper-limb vessels.","","978-1-4577-2176-2","978-1-4577-2175-5","10.1109/BHI.2012.6211663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211663","atherosclerosis;cardiovascular monitoring;central blood pressure;transfer function;transmission line","Atherosclerosis","blood;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;patient monitoring;transfer functions","average population model;central blood pressure estimation;central blood pressure waveform;generalized transfer function;leave-one-out cross-validation;noninvasive measurements;peripheral upper extremity arterial blood pressure;pervasive wave reflection effects;segmented transmission line model;traditional transmission line model;upper-limb peripheral site;upper-limb vessels","","0","","13","","","5-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To compliment this simulation, a top level design of a real time executive kernel has been developed to portray the basic techniques used when designing a real time executive kernel. Investigations into several types of redundancy management algorithms have revealed the differences in the real time requirements for these algorithms in the context of an advanced flight control system, and several of these algorithms have been incorporated into the simulator. The design process of the executive kernel and the redundancy management algorithms offer a basic understanding of how a real time system would be developed and designed. The use of the fault tolerant flight control simulator tool that has been developed allows an investigation, analysis, and trouble shooting of fault tolerant, real time system software architectures to be performed prior to the flight control architecture being formally defined. With the use of this FTFCS tool and the discussed design techniques, the non recurring costs and the actual design time of a flight control computer system could potentially be reduced. Future enhancements and efforts on this topic might include adding to the simulator the capability for processing user supplied scheduling techniques and redundancy management algorithms. This would make the simulation more generic in nature and would enhance its versatility to a greater variety of applications.

Ontologies play an important role for interoperability between organizations and for the semantic Web because they aim at capturing domain knowledge in a generic way and provide a consensual understanding of a domain. Alignment is the process where for each entity in first ontology we try to find a corresponding entity in the second ontology with the same or the closest meaning. Existing ontology alignment tools do not adequately provide a way for users to analyze the results. While many alignment tools generate lists of mappings it is difficult to analyze these alignments without examining every pairwise correspondence in the output files and even then it is an overwhelming task. We propose the use of visualization techniques to facilitate user understanding of the ontology alignment results.

Especially, Video-on-Demand (VoD) services are pushing the demand for broadband connectivity to the Internet, and optical fiber technology is being deployed in the access network to keep up with such increasing demand. To provide a more scalable network architecture for video/content delivery, network operators are currently considering novel integrated metro/access networks which accommodate replicated video servers directly in their infrastructure. In such way, servers for VoD delivery are placed nearer to the end users, the core segment of the network is partially traffic offloaded, and the end users experience better performance in terms of QoS. In our work, we will evaluate the performance improvement of an integrated metro/access architecture for VoD delivery with replicated video servers considering different configurations in terms of number of replicated servers, meshing degree and adopted network technologies. We develop a network simulator in which replicas of video servers (called Metro Servers, or MSs) are deployed to meet the demand of VoD traffic. In the result section we compare the performance of the various configurations and discuss which are the minimum requirements to minimize blocking of the VoD requests.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883853","","Broadband communication;Integrated optics;Optical network units;Optical switches;Servers;Streaming media","Internet;broadband networks;media streaming;optical fibre communication;quality of service;subscriber loops;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;video on demand;video servers","Internet traffic;MS;Metro Servers;QoS;VoD delivery;VoD requests;VoD services;VoD traffic offloading;broadband connectivity;integrated metro-access networks;media streaming traffic;meshing degree;network architecture;network operators;network simulator;optical fiber technology;replicated video servers;video-content delivery;video-on-demand services","","1","","12","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While we have used a standard face detector, we achieve face tracking combining a new scale invariant Kalman filter with kernel based tracking algorithm. From each potential face trajectory an angle histogram of neighboring points is then extracted. Finally, an Earth Mover's Distance-based K-NN classification discriminates true face trajectories from the false ones.

The declarative expression of a federation in terms of data flow among the component programs captures synchronization requirements implicitly and exploits the inherent concurrency automatically.

"Introducing Thread Criticality awareness in Prefetcher Aggressiveness Control","Panda, B.; Balachandran, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Indian Inst. of Technol. Madras, Chennai, India","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","A single parallel application running on a multi-core system shows sub-linear speedup because of slow progress of one or more threads known as critical threads. Some of the reasons for the slow progress of threads are (1) load imbalance, (2) frequent cache misses and (3) effect of synchronization primitives. Identifying critical threads and minimizing their cache miss latencies can improve the overall execution time of a program. One way to hide and tolerate the cache misses is through hardware prefetching. Hardware prefetching is one of the most commonly used memory latency hiding techniques. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of hardware prefetchers for multiprogrammed workloads (multiple sequential applications running independently on different cores). In contrast to multiprogrammed workloads, the performance of a single parallel application depends on the progress of slow progress(critical) threads. This paper introduces a prefetcher aggressiveness control mechanism called Thread Criticality-aware Prefetcher Aggressiveness Control (TCPAC). TCPAC controls the aggressiveness of the prefetchers at the L2 prefetching controllers (known as TCPAC-P), DRAM controller (known as TCPAC-D) and at the Last Level Cache (LLC) controller (known as TCPAC-C) using prefetch accuracy and thread progress. Each TCPAC sub-technique outperforms the respective state-of-the-art techniques such as HPAC [2], PADC [4], and PACMan [3] and the combination of all the TCPAC sub-techniques named as TCPAC-PDC outperforms the combination of HPAC, PADC, and PACMan. On an average, on a 8 core system, in terms of improvement in execution time, TCPAC-PDC outperforms the combination of HPAC, PADC, and PACMan by 7.61%. For 12 and 16 cores, TCPAC-PDC beats the state-of-the-art combinations by 7.21% and 8.32% respectively.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800293","","Accuracy;Hardware;Measurement;Message systems;Prefetching;Random access memory","multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;storage management","DRAM controller;L2 prefetching controllers;LLC controller;TCPAC mechanism;TCPAC-C;TCPAC-D;TCPAC-P;cache miss;cache miss latencies minimization;critical threads identification;hardware prefetching;last level cache controller;load imbalance;memory latency hiding techniques;multicore system;multiprogrammed workloads;prefetch accuracy;prefetcher aggressiveness control;program execution time;single parallel application;synchronization primitives;thread criticality awareness;thread progress","","0","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve the data transfer efficiency, DPCM and HSF encoding technologies were adopted to realize high effective compression. However, being a static code, HSF sometimes can lead to compression inefficiencies if the statistics of the actual data differ from the original one. Additionally, the adaptive Huffman code performs badly in segment fashions, like SMS. We developed a set of schemes on dynamic HSF code table, and modeled and calculated the departure between the ideal code table and the running one to decide whether updating was needed. By compressing the code-table's redundancy and rectifying HSF code, we can use only some dozens of bytes to figure the whole HSF code table including 511 symbols. As a result, only one short message is needed to transfer the whole HSF code table.","","0-7803-8647-7","","10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1345964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1345964","","Decoding;Encoding;Huffman coding;Insulation;Monitoring;Power engineering and energy;Power industry;Statistics;Telemetry;Testing","Huffman codes;condition monitoring;data structures;electronic messaging;power system measurement;redundancy;telemetry","DPCM encoding;HSF encoding;Huffman-Shannon-Fano code;SMS;Short Message Service data transfer technology;adaptive Huffman code;code table redundancy;code table transfer;code table updating;compression inefficiencies;data statistics;data transfer efficiency;dynamic HSF code table;effective compression;ideal code table;power industry monitoring;static code;symbols;table representation;telemetry","","0","","6","","","27-29 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel model is proposed in which oxide breakdown is triggered when the current level of steady-state SILC via electron tunneling between traps reaches a critical value. From the spatial distribution of traps, we have concentrated on the critical trap pair whose electron-tunneling probability has the smallest value in the middle of the SiO<sub>2</sub> films. To verify this model, the convoluted trap density which is related to the electron-tunneling probability between the critical trap pair is investigated.

Based on the modal and vibrational characteristics, it was found that the fabricated piezoelectric acoustic actuator has a significant dip of 1.32 kHz and peak of 2.24 kHz, which correspond respectively to the (1,3) and (3,1) resonant modes of the acoustic diaphragm. However, by attaching an elastic mass to the acoustic diaphragm with a shape similar to the (3,1) mode, the resonant frequencies corresponding to the (1,3) and (3,1) modes shifted to higher frequencies and the vibrational displacements at each mode were dramatically reduced by about 40%. As a result, the dip at (1,3) mode was greatly improved by 13 dB and total harmonic distortion was dramatically reduced from 80.83% to 8.71%.

A variety of Interconnects have been proposed during this period, with InfiniBand leading the way due to its high performance and open standard. At the same time, multiple programming models have emerged in order to meet the requirements of various applications and their programming models. To support requirements of multiple programming models, InfiniBand provides multiple transport semantics, ranging from unreliable connectionless to reliable connected characteristics. Among them, the reliable connection (RC) semantics is being widely used due to its high performance and support for novel features like Remote Direct Memory Acesss (RDMA), hardware atomics and Network Fault Tolerance. However, the pair wise connection oriented nature of the RC transport semantics limits its scalability and usage at the increasing processor counts. In this paper, we design and implement on-demand connection management approaches in the context of Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming models, which provided shared memory abstraction and one-sided communication semantics, leading to the development of multiple languages (UPC, X10, Chapel) and libraries (Global Arrays, MPI-RMA). Using Global Arrays as the research vehicle, we implement this approach with Aggregate Remote Memory Copy Interface (ARMCI), the runtime system of Global Arrays. We evaluate our approach, ARMCI-On Demand Connection Management (ARMCI-ODCM) using various micro benchmarks and benchmarks (LU Factorization, Random-Access and Lennard Jones simulation) and application (Subsurface transport over multiple phases (STOMP)). With the performance evaluation for up to 4096 processors, we are able to have a multi-fold reduction in connection memory with a negligible degradation in performance. Using STOMP at 4096 processors, reduces the overall connection memory by 66 times with no per- - formance degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design, implementation and evaluation of on-demand connection management with InfiniBand using PGAS models.","","978-1-4244-6987-1","","10.1109/CCGRID.2010.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5493482","InfiniBand;PGAS","Aggregates;Context modeling;Degradation;Electronics packaging;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Libraries;Memory management;Scalability;Vehicles","","","","4","","","","","17-20 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modified SIFT algorithm (called ROI-SIFT), followed by RANSAC to identify outliers, is used to localize and match correspondence interest points, that will be used to compute affine transformations for the registration of a dermatological image with the respective follow-up examination image.

In many cases, the microphone and likely source locations are known a priori, and calculating beamforming filters is therefore straightforward. In ad-hoc situations, however, when the microphones have not been systematically positioned, this information is not available and beamforming must be achieved blindly. In achieving this, a commonly neglected issue is whether it is optimal to use all of the available microphones, or only an advantageous subset of these. This paper commences by reviewing different approaches to blind beamforming, characterizing them by the way they estimate the signal propagation vector and the spatial coherence of noise in the absence of prior knowledge of microphone and speaker locations. Following this, a novel clustered approach to blind beamforming is motivated and developed. Without using any prior geometrical information, microphones are first grouped into localized clusters, which are then ranked according to their relative distance from a speaker. Beamforming is then performed using either the closest microphone cluster, or a weighted combination of clusters. The clustered algorithms are compared to the full set of microphones in experiments on a database recorded on different ad-hoc array geometries. These experiments evaluate the methods in terms of signal enhancement as well as performance on a large vocabulary speech recognition task.","1558-7916","","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2055560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497098","Array signal processing;speech enhancement;speech recognition","","array signal processing;blind source separation;microphone arrays;speech recognition;statistical analysis","ad-hoc array;beamforming filters;blind beamforming;clustered algorithms;microphone arrays;signal propagation vector;spatial coherence;speaker locations;speech recognition","","8","","32","","2010-06-28","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This can be used to make augmented vision to show X-ray vision to surgeons under operation. Also because of the characteristic of neurosurgery the required measurement area is relatively small but neurosurgery is very demanding in terms of accuracy, so the measurement should be within small numbers of micrometers. For accurate measurement specially designed stereo vision is implemented with IR illumination and retro-reflective marker spheres. With a pair of stereo images from the sensor system the three-dimensional coordinates and pose of the markers are calculated. By attaching these markers to patient, surgical instruments, and robot each set of the coordinate systems can be tracked with the proposed sensor system.","2093-7121","978-89-93215-05-2","","10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6703872","augmented reality;medical robot;navigation;retro-reflective marker sphere;stereo X-ray;stereo camera","Cameras;Navigation;Neurosurgery;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems","augmented reality;distributed sensors;medical image processing;medical robotics;neurophysiology;optical sensors;radiography;stereo image processing;surgery","C-arm fluoroscopy;IR illumination;O-arm fluoroscopy;X-ray vision;augmented reality system;bipolar X-ray fluoroscopy;camera vision;coordinates tracking;image-guided neurosurgery;markers pose;markers three-dimensional coordinates;multiple optic sensor system;neurosurgery robot;retro-reflective marker spheres;stereo vision;surgical instruments","","0","","15","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we compare the drain-induced barrier-lowering effect (DIBL) of VSA-TFTs. The VSA-TFTs with thinner gate oxide thickness, an offset structure, and a longer floating n<sup>+</sup> region have better immunity to DIBL. Second, VSA-TFTs with a longer floating n<sup>+</sup> region also have better immunity under hot-carrier (HC) stress and self-heating (SH) stress. However, VSA-TFTs with a shorter floating n<sup>+</sup> region also have better immunity to positive gate bias (PGB) stress. Consequently, in order to optimize reliability characteristics, including SH stress, HC stress, and PGB stress, it is necessary to modulate the length of the floating n<sup>+</sup> region. Third, the PGB stress, rather than SH stress or HC stress, becomes a major issue for VSA-TFTs under the stress bias below 4 V. In other words, PGB stress will dominate the degradation behaviors when the stress bias is not high enough to achieve SH stress and HC stress. Finally, the worst degradation condition of VSA-TFTs under HC stress, similar to that of most TFT devices, occurs when the stress of V<sub>G</sub> is less than half of V<sub>D</sub>.","0018-9383","","","10.1109/TED.2012.2199498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215029","Hot-carrier (HC) stress;polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors (poly-Si TFTs);positive gate bias (PGB) stress;self-heating (SH) stress;symmetric S/D;vertical channel","Degradation;Integrated circuit reliability;Logic gates;Plasmas;Stress;Thin film transistors","elemental semiconductors;hot carriers;nickel;semiconductor device reliability;silicon;thin film transistors","DIBL effect;HC stress;Ni-Si;PGB stress;SH stress;degradation behavior;drain-induced barrier-lowering effect;floating n<sup>+</sup> region;hot-carrier stress;offset structure;positive gate bias stress;reliability analysis;self-heating stress;symmetric VSA-TFT;symmetric vertical-channel nickel-salicided polySi thin-film transistor;thinner gate oxide thickness","","0","","31","","2012-06-11","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The fundamental goal of multiprocessing is improved performance through the introduction of additional hardware threads or cores (referred to as “cores” for simplicity). Modern network stacks can exploit parallel cores to allow either message-based parallelism or connection-based parallelism as a means to enhance performance. OpenSolaris has redesigned and parallelized to better utilize additional cores. Three special technologies, named Softring Set, Soft ring and Squeue are introduced in OpenSolaris for stack parallelization. In this paper, we study the OpenSolaris packet receiving process and its core parallelism optimization techniques. Experiment results show that these techniques allow OpenSolaris to achieve better network I/O performance in multiprocessing environments; however, network stack parallelization has also brought extra overheads for system. An effective and efficient network I/O optimization in multiprocessing environments is required to cross all levers of the network stack from network interface to application.","0742-1303","978-1-4244-8387-7","","10.1109/LCN.2010.5735726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5735726","Network Stack;OpenSolaris","Computer architecture;IP networks;Instruction sets;Optimization;Parallel processing;Throughput","multiprocessing systems;network interfaces;network operating systems;performance evaluation;protocols","OpenSolaris network stack parallelization;OpenSolaris packet receiving process;Soft ring;Softring Set;Squeue;connection-based parallelism;core parallelism optimization techniques;message-based parallelism;multiprocessing environments;network I/O optimization;network interface;parallel optimization evaluation;performance enhancement","","3","","6","","","10-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

State of the art requires prior interaction to grant access. Sharing with users who are not subscribed or previously have not been accepted as contacts in any case is only possible via public posts, which can easily be abused by automatic harvesting for user profiling, targeted spear-phishing, or spamming. Moreover, users are restricted to the access rules defined by the provider, which may be overly restrictive, cumbersome to define, or insufficiently fine-grained. We suggest a complementary approach that can be easily deployed in addition to existing access control schemes, does not require any interaction, and includes even public, unsubscribed users. It exploits the fact that different social circles of a user share different experiences and hence encrypts arbitrary posts. Assembling only well-established cryptographic primitives, we prove that the security of our scheme is determined by the entropy of the required knowledge. We consequently analyze the efficiency of an informed dictionary attack and assess the entropy to be on par with common passwords. A fully functional implementation is used for performance evaluations, and available for download on the Web.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883904","Secret Sharing;Social Network Security;Spam Protection","Access control;Ciphers;Dictionaries;Entropy;Social network services","authorisation;cryptography;social networking (online)","Web;access control schemes;access rules;confidential OSN posts;cryptographic primitives;dictionary attack;online social networks;protection layer;public posts;spamming;spear-phishing;user profiling","","0","","21","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this integrated data structure, the router can alternate between global and detailed routing operations, both of which use rip-up and reroute techniques. This integration has resulted in a router that can solve difficult problems not solvable by other programs while exhibiting runtimes that grow only moderately with the size of the routing problem.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-0869-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=122456","","Computer science;Data structures;Law;Legal factors;Phased arrays;Routing;Runtime;Very large scale integration;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;data structures","Codar;congestion-directed general area router;course wiring;detailed routing;global routing;grid map;grid space;integrated data structure;legal positions;rip-up and reroute techniques;routing tracks;wire segments","","17","4","9","","","7-10 Nov. 1988","07 Nov 1988-10 Nov 1988","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not appropriate for effective dealing with stochastic effects arising from inhomogeneities in a random medium that cause multipathing. In order to improve imaging effects in random media, an active-transducer array imaging approach motivated by time reversal mirrors is proposed. DOA imaging algorithm is based on the following steps: (1) an arrival time analysis of the echo received from the scatters , (2) the singular value decomposition of the array response matrix in the frequency domain. In comparison with traditional approach, this time-resolved imaging method compresses multipathing and realizes self-adaptive focusing. We illustrate the theory with the results of numeric simulations. The approach gives an effective estimate of the cross-range of the targets and has higher detection performance and statistical stability.","","978-1-4244-0737-8","978-1-4244-0737-8","10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4318782","DOA estimation;random medium;singular value decomposition;time reversal mirrors","Algorithm design and analysis;Focusing;Frequency domain analysis;Image analysis;Matrix decomposition;Mirrors;Random media;Scattering;Singular value decomposition;Stochastic processes","array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;frequency-domain analysis;singular value decomposition;stochastic processes","DOA imaging algorithm;active-transducer array imaging approach;array response matrix;frequency domain;imaging effects;multipathing methods;numeric simulations;self-adaptive focusing;singular value decomposition;statistical stability;stochastic effects;time reversal mirrors;time-resolved imaging method","","1","","10","","","23-25 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using simple rules, it is possible to define kernels which guarantee the RID properties. A primitive h(t) is the starting point for kernel design. Starting with this primitive h(t), one may evolve a RID which enjoys all of the desirable properties. In addition, RIDs designed by this means also exhibit scale invariance in addition to the time-shift invariance and frequency-shift invariance exhibited by members of Cohen's class relevant to these properties. Such RIDs also exhibit a property which we call information invariance. Information invariance is defined under Renyi's generalized information. Renyi information has been found to be a useful quantifier of resolution in TFDs wherein minimum values of Renyi information are related to maximum resolution of the signal components. In this paper, we show that h(t) may be adapted to minimize Renyi information and thus achieve very good time-frequency resolution","","0-7803-2127-8","","10.1109/TFSA.1994.467355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=467355","","Computer science;Delay effects;Energy resolution;Fourier transforms;Interference;Kernel;Signal resolution;Spectrogram;Time frequency analysis;Uncertainty","adaptive signal processing;interference (signal);minimisation;signal resolution;time-frequency analysis;uncertain systems","Cohen's class;Renyi information;adaptive RID kernels;frequency-shift invariance;information invariance;kernel design;minimization;reduced interference;reduced interference distribution;scale invariance;signal components;time-frequency distributions;time-frequency uncertainty;time-shift invariance","","22","","7","","","25-28 Oct 1994","25 Oct 1994-28 Oct 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two ICs were assembled together achieving a system-in-package. A direct-conversion BiCMOS tuner benefits from the low 1/f noise and high f<sub>tau</sub> bipolar transistors resulting in a lower noise figure in comparison with CMOS- implementations. The on-chip LNA noise was reduced by using a noise cancellation technique that rejects the noise contribution of the input devices, eliminating the need for an external LNA. The DC offset cancellation loop capacitors were integrated on-chip by combining multiple offset loops with a Miller capacitance multiplication. The die area was significantly reduced by replacing the multi-oscillator solution used at present with a single high frequency Colpitts oscillator followed by a ratiometric frequency divider that generates the local oscillator signals for the entire satellite TV L-band.","1088-9299","978-1-4244-1018-7","","10.1109/BIPOL.2007.4351845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351845","AGC loop;DVB;LC-VCO;LNA;PLL;frequency synthesizer;satellite TV tuner;zero-IF receiver","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Germanium silicon alloys;Noise cancellation;Noise figure;Noise reduction;Notice of Violation;Satellite broadcasting;Silicon germanium;TV;Tuners","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Ge-Si alloys;analogue-digital conversion;demodulators;direct broadcasting by satellite;low noise amplifiers;semiconductor materials;system-in-package;television receivers;tuning","BiCMOS direct-conversion TV tuner;CMOS demodulator-on-host;DBS satellite TV tuner;DC offset cancellation loop capacitors;LNA;Miller capacitance multiplication;SiGe;SiP integration;TV receiver;baseband ADC converters;bipolar transistors;front-end RF-to-digital tuner;high frequency Colpitts oscillator;integrated on-chip;lower noise figure;noise cancellation technique;on-chip ADC;ratiometric frequency divider;system-in-package","","1","","14","","","Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a slip-ring with Au plated on Ni base-plated layer is investigated in reliability against AgPd brush. Test conditions are 400rpm in rotation speed and 0-5A in operation current. Contact resistance and surface morphology are observed with operation time. Consequently, the lifetime is dependent on load current, with or without lubricant and sample, while the surface deterioration process is almost same. Namely firstly the Au plated layer is worn out, secondly the Ni base-plated layer and finally the wear reaches the bulk metal. At that time the contact resistance sharply increases and the life is over. At the final stage of the lifetime the contact surface is covered with black film which is estimated to be an oxide of a constituent element of the bulk metal by EPMA analysis.","","0-7803-9113-6","","10.1109/HOLM.2005.1518262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1518262","","Brushes;Contact resistance;Degradation;Gold;Life estimation;Lubricants;Power supplies;Surface morphology;Surface resistance;Testing","brushes;contact resistance;electrical contacts;electroplating;gold;nickel;power supplies to apparatus;silver alloys;surface morphology;wear","0 to 5 A;AgPd;AgPd brush;Au;EPMA analysis;Ni;black film;chip mounter;contact resistance;degradation process;gold plated layer;nickel base-plated layer;power supply slip-ring;sliding contact;sliding system;surface deterioration process;surface morphology","","2","1","6","","","26-28 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The magnetic sensitivity was not so high though the spatial resolution was good. In this paper, the flux transfer from the sample to the SQUID through the probe was investigated by using the magnetic field simulations. The result showed that the flux was decreased by a factor of more than 1,000 from the probe tip to the SQUID. The critical drop was occurred around the end of the probe. It suggested the magnetic coupling between the SQUID and the probe should be improved. The additional gap distance was needed in the initial rf-SQUID because of the thickness of the substrate resonator used with the rf-SQUID. Therefore, new rf-SQUIDs, which could be operated without a resonator, were fabricated to reduce the gap distance between the SQUID and the probe. The gap distance affected the quality of the magnetic images.","1051-8223","","","10.1109/TASC.2014.2361808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926826","Magnetic field measurement;Radio frequency;SQUIDs;Scanning probe microscopy;magnetic field measurement;radio frequency;scanning probe microscopy","Magnetic flux;Magnetic force microscopy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Microscopy;Probes;Resonant frequency;SQUIDs","SQUID magnetometers;magnetic flux;magnetic permeability","SQUID magnetometer;gap distance;magnetic flux transfer;magnetic permeability;needle probe;scanning SQUID probe microscope;spatial resolution;substrate resonator;superconducting quantum interference device","","0","","10","","2014-10-16","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Internet of Things (IoT) will change our lives again. From its humble beginning as Arpanet in 1969 to pervasive social networking, the Internet has been a major driving factor for the high tech industry. IoT is the next wave in the evolution of the Internet. With predicted 50 Billion IoT devices by 2020 and over $15 Trillion in generated profit over the next 10 years, IoT will have a profound and dominating impact on the high tech industry in general and the semiconductor industry in particular. Unlike semiconductor devices for mobile applications, most IoT devices do not use complex Systems-on-Chips (SoC). IoT devices are simple, small, do not require leading edge process technologies, and have low development cost. However, IoT devices have a very large spread of applications ranging from home automation, to smart power, to fleet management, to environmental control. The semiconductor device simplicity, lower development cost, and wide range of applications foster innovation, creativity, and novel technology applications. IoT creates an unprecedented era of IC design opportunities for small to medium size companies, worldwide. To prepare and capitalize on the IoT opportunities, a new IC design development model is needed. “IC design in cloud” offers a new enabling technology and a new business solution to lower the design barriers for IC design companies.","","","","10.1109/IDT.2014.7038572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038572","","","Internet of Things;cloud computing;innovation management;integrated circuit design;logic CAD","Arpanet;IC design development model;IC design-in-cloud;Internet of Things;IoT devices;SoC;integrated circuit design;pervasive social networking;semiconductor innovation;systems-on-chip","","0","","","","","16-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using X-ray technology, it is possible to determine a material's density and effective atomic number, or Z<sub>eff </sub>-related information. In theory, an illicit material can be identified using those two pieces of information. The R-L technology developed at Virginia Tech is the first true multisensing technology for explosive detection. It uses X-ray dual-energy transmission and X-ray scatter technologies to obtain characteristic values of an object; i.e., R and L. The material type of this object can then be determined using the R-L plane. R is related to Z<sub>eff</sub> and is obtained from dual-energy transmission signals. L is related to density, and is obtained using transmission and scatter signals. Compared to single-sensing technologies and pseudo-multisensing technologies, R-L technology should provide a much higher level of detection accuracy. However, the R and L values can only be computed from an object's true gray levels, which are defined as the measured gray levels of an object in different sensing modalities when it is not overlapped with any other objects. Because an object in a bag is always overlapped with many other objects, being able to identify the object of interest and remove the overlap effects becomes the key issue in determining the true gray levels of that object. This paper focuses on the development of an image processing system to determine an object's true gray levels in all the sensing modalities used in this work","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2005.855532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715504","Explosive detection;X-ray;image processing","Airports;Costs;Explosives;FAA;Image processing;Terrorism;X-ray detection;X-ray detectors;X-ray imaging;X-ray scattering","X-ray detection;X-ray scattering;explosions;image segmentation;sensor fusion","R-L technology;X-ray dual-energy transmission;X-ray scanner;X-ray scatter technology;X-ray technology;explosive detection;image processing method;multisensing technology","","2","","16","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The frequency-dependent elastic modulus of the silicone rubber was modeled by a four-parameter fractional derivative viscoelastic model in the 100 to 250 kHz frequency range. The calculations were carried out in the range of the first radial resonance frequency of the sensor. At the resonance, the hyperelastic effect of the silicone rubber was modeled by a hyperelastic compensating function. The calculated response was matched to the measured response by using the transitional peaks in the impedance spectrum that originates from the switching of standing Lamb wave modes in the silicone rubber. To validate the results, the impedance responses of three 5-mm-thick silicone rubber disks, with different radial lengths, were measured. The calculated and measured transitional frequencies have been compared in detail. The comparison showed very good agreement, with average relative differences of 0.7%, 0.6%, and 0.7% for the silicone rubber samples with radial lengths of 38.0, 21.4, and 11.0 mm, respectively.

However, because MAVs are flown close to the ground (300 meters or less in altitude), their field of view for any one image is relatively small. In addition, the context of the video (where and at what orientation are the objects being observed, the relationship between images) is unclear from any one image. To overcome these problems, we propose a geo-referenced mosaicing method that creates a mosaic from the captured images and geo-references the mosaic using information from the MAV IMU/GPS unit. Our method utilizes bundle adjustment within a constrained optimization framework. Using real MAV video, we have demonstrated our mosaic creation process on over 700 frames. Our method has been shown to produce the high quality mosaics to within 7 m using tightly synchronized MAV telemetry data and to within 30 m using only GPS information (i.e. no roll and pitch information).","","978-1-4244-3803-7","978-1-4244-3804-4","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354669","Bundle Adjustment;MAV;Mosaic;constrained optimization","Constraint optimization;Global Positioning System;Image analysis;Image resolution;Image sequences;Image storage;Intelligent robots;Telemetry;USA Councils;Videoconference","aircraft;geophysical signal processing;image segmentation;telemetry;video signal processing","GPS information;MAV video;bundle adjustment;constrained optimization;georeferenced mosaics;miniature aerial vehicles;mosaic creation process;telemetry","","2","","21","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various data and knowledge could be collected from manufacture, test bed measurement systems, on-board measurement systems, maintenance history and experts' experience. Integrating and fusing these data and information to provide intelligent fault diagnosis and maintenance schedules are essentially to both civil and military engines. Information fusion strategies and architectures have been developed over the last several years for improving upon the accuracy, robustness and overall effectiveness of diagnostic and prognostic technologies. Fusion of relevant sensor data, maintenance database information, and various diagnostic and prognostic technologies has been proven effective in reducing false alarm rates, increasing confidence levels in early fault detection, and predicting time to failure or degraded condition requiring maintenance action. In this paper, we researched on the architectures of fusion systems. A four-level model was presented to fit the usage in aircraft engines fault detection and diagnosis. To generate the deviations for gas path fault detection, baseline values should be chosen firstly. We analyzed choosing baseline values and generating deviations in detail. Then, the fuzzy set was introduced to descript the degree of symptoms belonging to fault patterns. A method based on fuzzy set to isolate fault and quantify the deterioration of performance of components was presented. We also demonstrated the method with an example. For this method, it is not necessary to have more measurements than fault patterns. The fault diagnosis system based on it is very easy to construct and extend too","","0-7803-9712-6","0-7803-9713-4","10.1109/ICMECH.2006.252524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018359","","Air safety;Aircraft propulsion;Costs;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Fusion power generation;Fuzzy sets;Intelligent sensors;Manufacturing;System testing","aerospace computing;aerospace engines;fault diagnosis;fuzzy set theory;maintenance engineering;sensor fusion","aircraft engine;data fusion;fuzzy set;gas path fault detection;information fusion;intelligent fault diagnosis;maintenance database information;maintenance scheduling;onboard measurement systems;prognostic technology;test bed measurement systems","","1","","8","","","3-5 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Civil and military applications of UAS demand ever-decreasing levels of human involvement and oversight, hence, UAS need to grow in autonomy. Autonomous deconfliction is a capability that is not only essential for the UAS's self-preservation, but also for avoiding damage to static infrastructure and/or to friendly and civilian aircraft flying contiguously. It is also key to the successful completion of the missions assigned to the UAS. Numerous solutions to partial aspects of autonomous deconfliction have been proposed. However, there is an enormous gap in systematic approaches that may be used for testing and evaluation (T&E) of autonomous capabilities such as deconfliction. This paper focuses on application of systems engineering-oriented tools to the analysis of autonomous deconfliction capability in UAS. The systems capability technical reference model (SC-TRM) presented in this work helps in identifying the different aspects of a deconfliction solution. Besides presenting the systems engineering-oriented tools and the analysis of the deconfliction problem based on those tools, this paper also proposes venues that may enable concrete implementation and development of T&E methods that are applicable to civil as well as military applications.","","978-1-4244-2621-8","978-1-4244-2622-5","10.1109/AERO.2009.4839599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839599","","Aerospace electronics;Biographies;Concrete;Control systems;Embedded system;Humans;Military aircraft;System testing;Systems engineering and theory;Unmanned aerial vehicles","aircraft control;control system analysis;remotely operated vehicles;systems engineering;testing","autonomous deconfliction;civilian aircraft;military applications;systems capability technical reference model;systems engineering;testing and evaluation;unmanned aircraft systems","","0","","31","","","7-14 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technical constraint is often considered to be a major limitation to the admissible level of embedded generation in an LV network. This paper deals with a study of the influence of embedded generation. The starting idea is that considering the worst-case load and generation combinations is too pessimistic. Therefore, a stochastic approach has been chosen. Loads and embedded generation production are modeled as stochastic processes whose characteristics depend on season and peak/low demand periods. Monte Carlo simulations yield the amount of time where the voltages are out of limits at one point in the network. The simulation results can be efficiently interpreted using the concept of critical network length and show how it is affected by the embedded generation. A reference LV radial distribution configuration is taken and different values of specific area load densities (kW/km<sup>2</sup>), cable-loading densities (kilowatts/kilometers), and LV network lengths are considered. For the evaluation of the networks currents and node voltages, a simple current injection method was chosen for its efficiency for studying the radial distribution network operating in the voltage limits (limited voltage regulation). The method was adapted for distributed loads. To conclude, a specific case with a substantial amount of additional DG is considered.","0885-8977","","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.848676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458915","Concept of limit radius;Monte Carlo method;current injection power flow;distribution network;embedded generation;radial network;stochastic process","Character generation;Distributed power generation;Mesh generation;Monte Carlo methods;Numerical models;Power cables;Power generation;Production;Stochastic processes;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;distributed power generation;distribution networks;stochastic processes;voltage control","Monte Carlo simulations;distributed electricity generation;embedded generation;low-voltage distribution networks;low-voltage radial distribution;simple current injection method;stochastic approach","","12","","15","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The multiple description coding method proposed takes into account the content of the image and provides the least amount of degradation, caused by loss of descriptors, for those areas of the image which are of greater interest. This is achieved by employing a nonlinear geometrical transform to add redundancy mainly to the area of interest followed by a partitioning of the non-linearly transformed image into sub-images which are coded and transmitted over separate channels. Simulations show that this approach yields exceptional performance even when only one descriptor is received. Moreover the method proposed can be implemented through pre- and postprocessing of the image data, without modification to the source codecs (e.g., JPEG).","","0-7695-1506-1","","10.1109/ITCC.2002.1000369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000369","","Computed tomography;Image coding;Image communication;Information technology","codecs;data compression;image coding;image segmentation;visual communication","JPEG;codecs;content-based image processing;content-based multiple description coding;descriptors;error prone environments;error resilient image communication;image partitioning;image transmission;nonlinear geometrical transform;redundancy;simulations","","0","1","","","","8-10 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the image content effect in classification, a correlation predictor is trained based on different types of image features. By using the predicted correlation and the actual correlation, a 2D classifier using support vector machine is proposed in this paper.

The interaction defines a population-dependent fitness function. The scGA employs multiple-spot mutation, various crossover operators and power-law scaled proportional fitness selection. In particular, the Vose-Liepins version of mutation-crossover is included. To achieve convergence, the mutation and crossover rates have to be annealed to zero in proper fashion, and power-law scaling is used with logarithmic growth in the exponent. If creatures of specific types exist that have maximal fitness in every population they reside in, then the scGA described here converges asymptotically to a probability distribution over multiuniform populations containing only such maximal creatures wherever they exist.","","0-7695-1957-1","","10.1109/ICCIMA.2003.1238124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238124","","Character generation;Chromium;Computational intelligence;DH-HEMTs;Genetic algorithms","convergence;genetic algorithms;maximum likelihood estimation;optimisation;statistical distributions","Vose-Liepins;crossover operators;crossover rates;genetic algorithm;logarithmic growth;maximal fitness;multiple-spot mutation;multispecies environment;multiuniform populations;mutation rates;mutation-crossover;optimization;population-dependent fitness function;power-law scaling;probability distribution;proportional fitness selection;scaled coevolutionary","","0","","","","","27-30 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose SpamWeeder, a simple idea for spam prevention, which targets the root of the spam problem - the email address trafficking. SpamWeeder can track the email address trafficking channels, expose the parties at the source of these channels, and precisely block all email from all and only parties belonging to a given distribution channel. SpamWeeder can further generate warnings to users against submitting their email addresses to parties likely to engage in address trafficking. Finally, our approach is transparent to users and can be installed autonomously by an organization intranet, without need for any changes to the rest of the email infrastructure.","","978-1-4244-2219-7","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.4544636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544636","","Bandwidth;Electronic mail;Feedback;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Target tracking;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;telecommunication traffic;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;SpamWeeder;distribution channel;email address trafficking channel;email spam;intranet;spam prevention;spam reduction","","1","","18","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The suboptimal performance prevails when those transforms are used for a sparse representation of functions consisting of smoothly varying areas separated by smooth contours. This paper introduces a method creating normal meshes with nonsubdivision connectivity to approximate the nonsmoothness of such images efficiently. From a domain decomposition viewpoint, the method is a triangulation refinement method preserving contours. The so-called normal offset decomposition searches from the midpoint of the edges in the previous approximation along the normal direction until it pierces the surface that represents the image and adds the piercing points to the approximation. The transform is nonlinear as it depends on the actual image. In this paper, we propose a normal offset based compression algorithm for digital images. The discrete setting causes the transform to become redundant. We also propose a model to encode the obtained coefficients. We show rate distortion curves and compare the results with the JPEG2000 encoder.","","978-0-7695-2887-8","","10.1109/IMVIP.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4318148","","Compression algorithms;Computer science;Digital images;Discrete transforms;Image coding;Image processing;Machine vision;Rate-distortion;Tensile stress;Wavelet transforms","image processing;wavelet transforms","digital images;geometrical image compression;nonlinear contour preserving transform;tensor product wavelet methods;triangulation refinement method","","0","","","","","5-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traffic channel access and modulation is based on a spectrally efficient CDMA scheme. The satellite code-division switch (CDS) routes calls from an uplink to a downlink beam without onboard demodulation and channel decoding. This system operates with demand assignment control; that is, channel bandwidth and switch connections are only assigned per user request. The system can offer a wide variety of bit rates with wireline quality of service. The services provided are circuit-switched calls for voice data and video, and packet-switched for data. As shown, the proposed SE-CDMA can achieve high capacity and very low bit error rates at low signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the innovative switching technique can provide low complexity and achieve high throughput for all services","0163-6804","","","10.1109/35.774885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=774885","","Artificial satellites;Bandwidth;Communication switching;Computer aided instruction;Control systems;Decoding;Demodulation;Downlink;Multiaccess communication;Switches","circuit switching;code division multiple access;data communication;demand assigned multiple access;multiuser channels;network interfaces;packet radio networks;quality of service;satellite communication;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication signalling;telecommunication traffic;visual communication;voice communication","SS/CDMA;bit rates;channel bandwidth assignment;circuit-switched calls;code-division multiple access;common air interface;data;demand assignment control;downlink;downlink beam;geostationary fixed satellite service;modulation;multibeam satellite;onboard code switching mechanism;packet-switched service;satellite code-division switch;satellite switched CDMA system;signaling control;switch connections;system architecture;system performance;traffic channels;video;voice;voice data;wireline quality of service","","3","1","11","","","Jul 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The combination of air and permeate backwashing as membrane fouling controlling technique was adopted and the membrane bio-reactor in treating municipal wastewater as reclaimed water was studied, as well as the economic feasibility was analyzed in this study. The results showed that the effluent quality was superior and stable, colorless and odourless, COD<; 30 mg/L, NH<sub>3</sub>-N <; 0.5 mg/L, and no coliform was identified if the membrane bio-reactor was adopted to treat municipal wastewater. The effluent quality met the ""National Standard of Reclaimed Water"" (CJ 25.1-89). This back washing technique could blow off the cake layer deposited on the membrane surface greatly, decrease the membrane resistance, recover the membrane flux and maintain the membrane permeability, so it could be taken as an effective membrane fouling controlling technique.","2151-7614","978-1-4244-5088-6","","10.1109/icbbe.2011.5781019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5781019","","Biomembranes;Effluents;Immune system;Resistance;Wastewater;Water pollution;Water resources","bioreactors;economics;membranes;wastewater treatment;water pollution;water resources","economic feasibility;membrane bioreactor technology;membrane fouling;membrane resistance;urban wastewater reclamation;urban wastewater reuse;wastewater treatment;water environmental pollution;water resource","","0","","6","","","10-12 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is shown that mode partitioning between the main mode and a weak side mode in conjunction with the difference in longitudinal distributions can lead to strong rebroadening even for side mode suppression ratios (SMRs) larger than 30 dB. An analytical expression for the new linewidth contribution is derived. The contribution increases with the third power of the photon number in the dominant side mode. This agrees with experiments on DFB lasers when one generally observes a strong increase in linewidth where the SMSR decreases below 30 dB. This work and the reported experimental results clearly show that linewidths increase if the side mode suppression goes down. However, it seems that in some DFB lasers rebroadening can occur without any decrease in SMSR, so that other mechanisms need to be considered.<<ETX>>","1041-1135","","","10.1109/68.76858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=76858","","Charge carrier density;Ear;Fabry-Perot;Fluctuations;Frequency;Laser modes;Laser noise;Laser tuning;Semiconductor device noise;Semiconductor lasers","distributed feedback lasers;laser modes;laser theory;semiconductor junction lasers;spectral line breadth","DFB lasers;distributed feedback;laser modes;linewidth rebroadening;main mode;mode partitioning;photon number;side mode suppression ratios;weak side modes","","16","","8","","","Feb. 1991","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The power produced by a PV module depends on the solar irradiance and temperature. MPPT controllers adaptively search and maintain operation at the maximum power point for changing irradiance and temperature condition, thus maximizing the panel power output and consequently minimizing the overall system cost. Various conventional MPPT algorithms have been proposed for ideal conditions, few algorithms were derived to extract true maximum power under partial shading conditions, and very few have addressed the problem of continuously changing shading conditions caused by changing weather conditions, e.g. rain, clouds. Under dynamically changing conditions, the conventional MPPT controllers can't find the true MPP (global MPP) and are often track to a local one. In this work, results are obtained for a tracking algorithm based on Bayesian fusion combined with swarm intelligence. Compared to state-of-the-art trackers, the system achieves global maximum power tracking and higher efficiency for modules with different optimal current, caused by continuously changing uneven insolation.","","978-1-4577-0804-6","","10.1109/EPECS.2011.6126831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126831","Bayesian fusion;Solar power generation;computational intelligence;particle swarm optimization;photovoltaic system","Algorithm design and analysis;Bayesian methods;Heuristic algorithms;Photovoltaic systems;Vectors;Voltage control","maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems;power generation control","Bayesian fusion;MPPT controller;changing-weather conditions;distributed PV modules;distributed photovoltaic modules;global MPP;global maximum power tracking;multidimensional maximum power point tracking;panel power output;partial shading conditions;solar irradiance;swarm intelligence;system cost minimization;temperature condition;true-maximum power;unified controller","","1","","5","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Academia has taught computer forensics students that one of the most important elements of the digital forensic process is having a working copy of the original device. Though this concept works well with computers and laptops, it does not with smartphones. At this point, a bit-for-bit image of a smartphone cannot be made. Furthermore, any action taken on a smartphone is logged and therefore, attempting to create a copy would in essence change the state of the device; making the use of hashes null and void. In an effort to realize interesting and unique forensic patterns in the operations of smartphones, two experiments were designed using XRY, DiffMerge, and four smartphone devices: RIM Blackberry 8703e, Blackberry 7103, Blackberry 8530, and Symbian HTC TouchPro 6850. These experiments allowed the researchers to compare and contrast the four smartphones not only by the specific device but by carrier, manufacturer, file size by category, file size by test, and folder size in terms of how the kernel deals with file stores, edits, and deletes after specific user operations. The outcome of the experiments resulted in a process that helps the forensic examiner to manually inspect a device while being aware of the path of contamination introduced to the device through user functions. The goal of this research is to create an open debate in the forensic community about the consideration of different standards when examining smartphones, one of which would be the acceptance of change.","","978-1-4799-3963-3","","10.1109/THS.2013.6699002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699002","Small Scale Digital Forensics;digital forensics;mobile device;process modelling","Browsers;Computers;Digital forensics;Performance evaluation;Smart phones","digital forensics;file organisation;smart phones","Blackberry 7103;Blackberry 8530;DiffMerge;RIM Blackberry 8703e;Symbian HTC;TouchPro 6850;XRY file;bit-for-bit image;computer forensics students;computer security;contamination;digital forensic process;file size by category;file size by test;folder size;forensic community;forensic patterns;smartphone devices","","0","","5","","","12-14 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bigger rotor size means the wind shear and turbulence would be more obvious. In such situations, only having the information of a hub height wind speed is not enough for the maximum power point tracking control and the load reduction control. The accurate information of wind speed is crucial in the large-scale wind turbine control and requires numerous wind sensors to be installed on the three wind turbine blades. The commonly used wind sensors such as pitot tube, hot-wire anemometer and sonic anemometer are usually expensive and thus not practically feasible by installing many wind sensors in a single wind turbine. Inspired by the microtab based smart blade (MBSB), a cost effective, microtab based wind sensor (MBWS) is proposed in this paper. We then discuss the design, structure and working principle of the new MBWS. Finally, using a finite element analysis, geometric features of the MBWS are determined. A novel method for the calculation of wind speed is given and its effectiveness is validated by three application cases, in which it is illustrated how wind speeds in multiple positions can be measured by installing more low-cost MBWS in three blades of a wind turbine.","","","","10.1109/WCICA.2014.7053753","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053753","Wind speed measurement;effective wind speed;ice-free;low cost;microtab based wind sensor","Automotive components;Blades;Fluid flow measurement;Force;Torque;Wind speed;Wind turbines","blades;finite element analysis;microsensors;position measurement;rotors;velocity measurement;wind turbines","MBSB;MBWS;finite element analysis;horizontal axis wind turbine;hot-wire anemometer;hub height wind speed;large-scale wind turbine control;load reduction control;maximum power point tracking control;microtab based smart blade;microtab based wind sensor;pitot tube;position measurement;rotor;sonic anemometer;velocity measurement;wind shear;wind turbine blade;wind turbulence","","0","","","","","June 29 2014-July 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the applications, it is required that the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors should meet the Welch bound equality strictly or asymptotically. In this paper, a new (N, K) codebook is constructed from a K×N partial Fourier matrix with N = K<sup>2</sup> -1 and K=2<sup>k</sup> for a positive integer k, where each code vector is equivalent to a column of the matrix. To obtain the K×N partial Fourier matrix, K rows are selected from the N ×N inverse discrete Fourier transform matrix, where a set of the selected row indices is determined from the structure of binary m-sequences of period N. Through a theoretical study, it is found that the magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors is two-valued, and its maximum nearly achieves the Welch bound equality. The new near-optimal codebook, equivalent to a nearly equiangular tight frame, can find its potential applications in deterministic compressed sensing.","2157-8095","978-1-4673-2580-6","978-1-4673-2578-3","10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283952","Codebooks;Compressed sensing;Fourier matrices;Welch bound;m-sequences","Arrays;Compressed sensing;Correlation;Cryptography;Indexes;Polynomials;Vectors","binary sequences;compressed sensing;discrete Fourier transforms;m-sequences;matrix algebra","(N,K) codebook;K×N partial Fourier matrix;N×N inverse discrete Fourier transform matrix;Welch bound equality;binary m-sequences;deterministic compressed sensing;distinct code vectors;equiangular tight frame;near-optimal partial Fourier codebook;positive integer;quantum computing;signal processing","","1","","24","","","1-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture elevates two forms of processing as first-class items: individual transformations of global state, as defined in pure functions, and rules of interaction of transformations, as managed by an engine that maintains certain invariants.

To this end, activity and attenuation maps generated using high-resolution anatomical images from patients were used as input maps in a MC projector to simulate SPECT or PET sinograms. The reconstructed images were compared with the corresponding real SPECT or PET studies in an iterative process where the activity inputs maps were being modified at each iteration. Datasets of 30 refractory epileptic patients were used to assess the new method. Each set consisted of structural images (MRI and CT) and functional studies (SPECT and PET), thereby allowing the inclusion of anatomical and functional variability in the simulation input models. SPECT and PET sinograms were obtained using the SimSET package and were reconstructed with the same protocols as those employed for the clinical studies. The convergence of Brain-VISET was evaluated by studying the behavior throughout iterations of the correlation coefficient, the quotient image histogram and a ROI analysis comparing simulated with real studies. The realism of generated maps was also evaluated. Our findings show that Brain-VISET is able to generate realistic SPECT and PET studies and that four iterations is a suitable number of iterations to guarantee a good agreement between simulated and real studies.","0278-0062","","","10.1109/TMI.2014.2326041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819831","Anatomical variability;Monte Carlo (MC) simulation;emission tomography;epilepsy;functional variability","Attenuation;Brain modeling;Computed tomography;Histograms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Single photon emission computed tomography","Monte Carlo methods;biomedical MRI;brain;image reconstruction;iterative methods;medical image processing;positron emission tomography;single photon emission computed tomography","MC projector;MC simulation;MRI;Monte Carlo simulation;PET sinograms;ROI analysis;SPECT sinograms;SimSET package;[ <sup>18</sup>F]-PET brain databases;[ <sup>99m</sup>Tc]-SPECT brain databases;anatomical information;attenuation maps;brain-VISET;brain-VISET convergence;correlation coefficient;functional information;high-resolution anatomical images;image processing;image reconstruction;quotient image histogram;refractory epileptic patients;structural images;voxel-based iterative method;voxel-based iterative simulation-for-emission tomography","","0","","34","","2014-05-22","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society 1999 12th Annual Meeting","20020806","1999","2","","705","706 vol.2","The authors' approach makes use of the fact that in many practical devices, the lasing spectrum is restricted to only a few longitudinal modes, either by virtue of high repetition rate or by an artificial spectrally selective element such as a distributed Bragg reflector. These lasers therefore render themselves more naturally, not to the fully-time-domain analysis, but to a time-frequency-domain approach. The model is applicable to a wide variety of realistic actively, passively and hybridly mode-locked structures, and takes into account both slow and fast nonlinearities in the active medium. With this model, we can describe, on the same footing, a wide variety of transient as well as steady-state regimes including CW lasing, fully or partially rendered mode-locking (ML), and more complex dynamics including self-pulsing and chaotic instabilities. In our approach, the lasing light is decomposed into a set of longitudinal modes of the realistic (open and inhomogeneous) cavity. We first apply the model to a Fabry-Perot passively mode-locked (F=100 GHz) laser; the resulting steady-state spectra agree well with distributed time-domain model (DTDM) simulations, whilst providing an increase of about an order of magnitude in computation speed. Next, the model is applied to colliding-pulse ML (CPM) lasers (F-200 GHz); as expected, all the “odd” modes die out during the first 1-2 ns of the transient regime and are suppressed by at least 20 dB in the resulting spectrum, which corresponds to a full repetition frequency doubling of the ML pulse train.

This paper describes a method of reducing the processing time while achieving the necessary processing. To speed up the processing, three reduction measures are proposed: (1) reduction of the number of times the GA processing algorithm is executed, (2) reduction of the number of generations by means of promoting evolution and selection, and (3) reduction of the time per generation needed for the process. As implemented results, the processing time, which was formerly 60 seconds or longer, was reduced to two seconds or less, or in other words, we could manage to reduce the time needed by all the processing to approximately one thirtieth.","","978-1-4577-0233-4","","10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2011.6031810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6031810","GA;embedded systems;remote controller;user interface","Conferences;Educational institutions;Embedded systems;Genetic algorithms;Graphical user interfaces;Sorting;Time measurement","display instrumentation;genetic algorithms;graphical user interfaces","GUI display;faster processing;genetic algorithm","","0","","2","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Use of microstrip transmission lines as couplers or adaptors to connect miniature components under test to standard coaxial broadband test equipment can provide considerably better control of impedance match than other transmission line configurations resulting in improved accuracy of measurement and convenience of use. A description of microstrip characteristics and fabrication procedures pertinent to this application is given. A novel microstrip device with a provision for inserting current probes, electroexplosive devices, magnetic cores and other miniature current-sensitive components has been built and tested. It can be used as a broadband coupler for measuring impedance and transient response to current inputs or as a calibrator to supply a predetermined current to a current-sensing probe from DC to 1.1 GHz with a maximum error of 2.7 dB. Other microstrip couplers designed for measurements on electroexplosive devices are also described.","0018-9375","","","10.1109/TEMC.1969.4307215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4307215","","","","","","0","","8","","","17-19 June 1969","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is despite the advent of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, aka particle filters) methods, which provide very good approximations to the optimal filter under weak assumptions. Several algorithms based on SMC have been proposed in the past 10 years to solve the static parameter problem. However all the algorithms we are aware of suffer from the so-called `degeneracy problem'. We propose here a methodology for point estimation of static parameters which does not suffer from this problem. Our methods take advantage of the fact that many state space models of interest are ergodic and stationary: this allows us to propose contrast functions for the static parameter which can be consistently estimated and optimised using simulation-based methods. Several types of contrast functions are possible but we focus here on the average of a so-called pseudo-likelihood which we maximize using on-line Expectation-Maximization type algorithms. In its basic form the algorithm requires the expression of the invariant distribution of the underlying state process. When the invariant distribution is unknown, we present an alternative which relies on indirect inference techniques.","","0-7803-9567-0","","10.1109/CDC.2005.1582177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1582177","","Automatic control;Inference algorithms;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Monte Carlo methods;Parameter estimation;Probability distribution;Sliding mode control;State estimation;Statistics","","","","9","","13","","","12-15 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The weights are computed by walking through the range of test generation approaches from pure random at one extreme to deterministic at the other extreme, dynamically selecting the weight assignments to correspond to the remaining faults at every stage.

The expected number of paging area boundary crossings and the cost of the distance-based location update method are analyzed by using the classical renewal theory for two different call handling models. For the call plus location update model, two cases are considered. In the first case, the intercall time has an arbitrary distribution and the cell residence time has an exponential distribution. In the second case, the intercall time has a hyper-Erlang distribution and the cell residence time has an arbitrary distribution. For the call without location update model, both intercall time and cell residence time can have arbitrary distributions.

This concern is further increased in India, due to its large population of the unmanned railroad crossings. Almost 40% of the level crossings present in India are unmanned. Hence this calls for an efficient, robust and stable automatic gate closure system. This paper proposes an intelligent level crossing controller (ILC) from a new dimension altogether. This is an innovative approach which combines the use of GPS (global positioning system) tracking system and GSM (global system for mobile communication) modem to accomplish an efficient gate closing at the level crossings. Detectors are also placed on the railway tracks which sense the arrival and departure of the train and also forward this information to the subsequent crossings. These detectors are also interfaced with the controllers present in the train to activate the motors at the gate accordingly. The system has been simulated and the results showed that the system has high speed, stability, accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. This ILC has been designed such that it is easy to apply this controller under most kinds of situations, locations and tracks.","","978-1-4799-4098-1","","10.1109/GHTC-SAS.2014.6967591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967591","GPS tracking;GSM modem;microcontroller;unmanned gate crossing","GSM;Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;Logic gates;Microcontrollers;Receivers;Sensors","Global Positioning System;cellular radio;railway accidents","GPS;GSM;India;global positioning system tracking system;global system for mobile communication modem;humanitarian intelligent level crossing controller;railway tracks;unmanned railroad crossings","","0","","15","","","26-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, our RD beamspace techniques aim at designing optimal beamspace matrices based on reasonable tradeoffs between the desired in-sector source distortion and the powerful jammer (possibly in-sector) attenuation when conducting the jammers suppression. These designs are cast as convex optimization problems which are derived using second-order cone programming. Meanwhile, we study the MUSIC-based direction-of-arrival estimation performance of the proposed beamspace designs by comparing to the conventional algorithms.

By retransmission within the range of the delay restriction specified by PR-SCTP while doing buffering, the tolerance to a burst packet loss can be improved in exchange for some delay.We have implemented the proposed method as a translator of RTP in consideration of interoperability with the existing application implemented with RTP/UDP. And we artificially caused the burst-packet loss as an experiment in the translator and evaluate the outcome of an experiment.","","978-1-4244-4776-3","978-0-7695-3700-9","10.1109/SAINT.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5230778","PR-SCTP;Real-time Video Streaming;Translator","Internet","forward error correction;transport protocols;video streaming","PR-SCTP;burst packet loss;real-time video streaming;reliable streaming transmission","","7","","6","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, network flows are a fundamental tool for modeling the network behavior, identifying security attacks, and validating research results. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of network flows, security and privacy concerns discourage the publication of such datasets. On the one hand, existing techniques proposed to sanitize network flows do not provide any formal guarantees. On the other hand, microdata anonymization techniques are not directly applicable to network flows. In this paper, we propose a novel obfuscation technique for network flows that provides formal guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. Our work is supported by extensive experiments with a large set of real network flows collected at an important Italian Tier II Autonomous System, hosting sensitive government and corporate sites.

For this linear system with excitation signals, the policy iteration (PI) technique is investigated to adaptively find the optimal control law in the presence of both internal uncertainties and known excitation signals. For the proposed PI technique, the stability of the closed-loop system and convergence to the optimal solution are mathematically proven.

Exploiting this parallelism and optimizing for the GPU memory hierarchy is well-understood for regular applications that operate on dense data structures such as arrays and matrices. However, there has been significantly less work in the area of irregular algorithms and even less so when pointer-based dynamic data structures are involved. Recently, irregular algorithms such as Barnes-Hut and kd-tree traversals have been implemented on GPUs, yielding significant performance gains over CPU implementations. However, the implementations often rely on exploiting application-specific semantics to get acceptable performance. We argue that there are general-purpose techniques for implementing irregular algorithms on GPUs that exploit similarities in algorithmic structure rather than application-specific knowledge. We demonstrate these techniques on several tree traversal algorithms, achieving speedups of up to 38× over 32-thread CPU versions.","","978-1-4503-2378-9","","10.1145/2503210.2503223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877443","GPU;irregular programs;tree traversals;vectorization","Abstracts;Educational institutions;Legged locomotion;Optimization;Propulsion;Semantics;Servers","multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;tree data structures","Barnes-Hut tree traversal algorithm;CPU versions;GPU execution;GPU memory hierarchy;algorithmic structure;application-specific semantics;general-purpose techniques;irregular algorithms;kd-tree traversal algorithm;offloading workloads;pointer-based dynamic data structures;programmer-friendly GPU computing environments","","0","","","","","17-22 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In education, there are great advantages for high-schools to utilize these online communication platforms, especially Online Open Forums and Social Networking Sites. Communication is the backbone of education. Everything from classroom teaching to school policy making depends on effective communication [1]. With these new communication platforms at hand, schools can develop more adaptable and friendly channels among students, teachers and management (only the first two interveners are covered under this study). Various components of the schools will essentially work together in a more collaborative and regenerative way [2]. This research paper analyses how online communication platforms are changing the internal nature of education. It takes sample populations from two schools in Macao (Pre-University of the University of Saint Joseph, USJ, and Colégio Diocesano de São José, CDSJ) with different backgrounds such as medium of language, level of degree, professor's background and style of teaching. Teachers of these schools are communicated first for their opinion on key elements to improve learning with online communication platforms. These factors are implemented in a platform such as Social Networking Sites.

To reduce the environmental influence, a detailed analysis of the contribution of each gas used during manufacturing was carried out which identified NF3 as contributing almost 50% of the total process gas used (by weight), with the majority of this used for dry cleaning. In this study, sk Hynix has evaluated on-site generated F2 from Linde as an alternative cleaning gas to NF3 for our 300mm process line. F2 has been used for cleaning 300mm batch type LPCVD process tools since 2003 and we now study 2 single wafer PECVD process tools for different processes. When F2 was used for PECVD chamber cleaning, the etch rate was increased by up to a factor of 2. There was also greater process chamber temperature stability which meant that post clean conditioning could be significantly shortened even without clean recipe optimization giving a reduction in total non-productive time of around 40%. RPS plasma power consumption is reduced by up to 50% and there are also significant reductions in the mass of gas required. Thermal cleaning with F2 was also demonstrated.","1078-8743","978-1-4673-0350-7","","10.1109/ASMC.2012.6212907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212907","300mm;Fluorine;chamber cleaning;environmental effect","Atomic measurements;Cleaning;Films;Global warming;Optimization;Plasma temperature;Silicon","air pollution control;chemical vapour deposition;laundering;power consumption;semiconductor device manufacture","Linde;NF3 gas;RPS plasma power consumption;batch type LPCVD process tool;eco-efficiency indicator;environmental influence;global warming emission;greenhouse gas elimination;low-pressure chemical vapor deposition;material consumption;performance value;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;post clean conditioning;power consumption value;process chamber temperature stability;regulation compliance;semiconductor dry cleaning process;single wafer PECVD process tool;size 300 mm;sk Hynix;thermal cleaning","","0","","7","","","15-17 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The effect of demand uncertainty in a price setting newsvendor model","Ming Xu; You Chen","Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Service Systems and Service Management, 2008 International Conference on","20080812","2008","","","1","1","This paper considers the classical newsvendor problem with a price-dependent, random, demand. At the beginning of a selling season, a joint decision on order quantity and selling price is made for the season, to maximize the expected profit. We analyze the impact of demand uncertainty on the profit, price and order quantity. Intuition has that when the demand is more uncertain, the optimal price will be higher, the order quantity will be smaller, and the maximal achievable profit will be lower. Our analysis demonstrates that this is true for many demand functions and random distributions that are both theoretically plausible and commonly used in practice. However, in general, exceptions exist, for which this intuition does not hold true. In other words, a reduction in demand uncertainty may not result in lower price, or higher profit. Whether the profit increase occurs depends on many factors such as the definitions of uncertainty, the cost structure, and demand functional form. Many firms commit resources to reduce forecasting errors or variability through information collecting efforts and process improvement initiatives (e.g., collaborative forecasting, accurate response, delayed differentiation, and so on). Such efforts may assume that stochastically less variable demand is beneficial. Hence, the result in this paper is of practical importance.","","978-1-4244-1671-4","978-1-4244-1672-1","10.1109/ICSSSM.2008.4598494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598494","","Collaboration;Cost function;Delay;Demand forecasting;Uncertainty","pricing;uncertainty handling","cost structure;demand functional form;demand uncertainty;newsvendor model;order quantity;price setting","","0","","","","","June 30 2008-July 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Oxidation may occur during production of polyethylene, during the extrusion and curing process used to produce XLPE cables, or in subsequent processes/operation of the cables. Oxidized particles are here referred to as organic contaminants. In the present study artificial organic contaminants were introduced in XLPE samples made for electrical treeing measurements. Instead of using the common needle-needle or needle-plane configuration, a wire-plane configuration was used. Organic contaminants have an increasing conductivity and permittivity as function of increasing degree of oxidation. These properties most probably give rise to local electric field enhancements in the material. The morphology of organic contaminants also differs from virgin XLPE, which probably cause bad adhesion between the XLPE matrix and the contaminants. A combination of these factors was found to affect the electrical performance of the insulation. Several different parameters, such as dry and wet ageing, as well as AC voltage and DC voltage stress, were included in the study.","0084-9162","978-1-4673-1253-0","978-1-4673-1251-6","10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378851","","Aging;Electric breakdown;Electric fields;Oxidation;Polymers;Wires","XLPE insulation;electrical conductivity;inclusions;measurement systems;permittivity;power cable insulation;trees (electrical)","AC voltage stress;DC voltage stress;XLPE insulation;XLPE matrix;artificial organic contaminants;conductivity;crosslinked polyethylene insulation;curing process;dry ageing;electrical treeing measurements;extrusion process;inclusions effects;local electric field enhancements;needle-needle configuration;needle-plane configuration;oxidized particles;permittivity;polyethylene production;wet ageing;wire-plane configuration","","0","","","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of optimization and changes in the system like, glass recycling and plastic recycling, and design for end-of-life activities is determined. Finally the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed WEEE/RoHS Directives can be reviewed. The strength of the eco-efficiency concept is demonstrated on a large number of products and scenarios. It is shown that, ""eco-efficient improvements"" vary substantially per product category. The quantitative eco-efficiency concept as such is proven to be very useful in monitoring take-back system performance in general and in addressing the role of all actors and stakeholders in particular.

In this paper, efforts are made to generate trajectory for these operations. Firstly, an extended manipulability index is proposed to optimize the key poses so that the humanoid robot has the manipulability considering joint limits at the key poses, which makes it convenient to adjust the trajectory. Secondly, a fast approach to generating the whole trajectory consisting of all the key poses and the strategies to realize the trajectory adjustment when specifications change are proposed. Finally, the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) displacement excited by the reactive operations is also given to decide whether the generated trajectory is feasible.

IEEE/WIC International Conference on","20031027","2003","","","47","53","In recent years, information has grown rapidly, especially on the World Wide Web. Also volume of information found by search engines tends to be large, and these documents are not tailored to a user's actual needs and interests. Thus, to offer the personalized service that includes only user interested information become increasingly important. Web mining techniques have proven themselves as a very useful tool for mining information of interests on the Web. However, past pioneers' studies have indicated that the main challenges in Web mining are in terms of handling high-dimensional data, achieving incremental learning (or incremental mining), providing scalable mining and parallel and distributed mining algorithms. We present a novel self-organizing hierarchical CMAC (HCMAC) neural network composed of two-dimensional weighted grey CMACs (WGCMAC) capable of handling both higher dimensional classification problems and self-organizing memory structure according to the distribution of training patterns. Moreover, a learning algorithm that can learn incrementally from new added data without forgetting prior knowledge is proposed to train the self-organizing HCMAC neural network. It can be applied to incrementally learn user profiles from user feedback for identifying personalized Web pages. A benchmark dataset of Web pages ratings that contains four topics of user profiles is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the self-organizing HCMAC neural network has a good incrementally learning ability and can overcome the problem of enormous memory requirement in the conventional CMAC while it is applied to solve the higher dimensional classification problems. Furthermore, experiments also confirm that the self-organizing HCMAC neural network has a better forecasting ability to identify user interesting Web pages than other well-known classifiers do.","","0-7695-1932-6","","10.1109/WI.2003.1241172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241172","","Collaboration;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information filters;Intelligent agent;Neural networks;Search engines;Web mining;Web pages;Web sites","Internet;Web sites;cerebellar model arithmetic computers;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);online front-ends;search engines;self-organising feature maps","Web page mining;Web sites;World Wide Web;cerebellar model arithmetic computers;incremental learning;incremental personalized service;learning algorithm;scalable mining;search engines;self-organizing hierarchical CMAC;training patterns;weighted grey CMAC","","3","","","","","13-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The EEG recordings of the ambulatory recording systems generate very lengthy data and the detection of the epileptic activity requires a time-consuming analysis of the entire length of the EEG data by an expert. A neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection method is proposed in this paper, which uses delay time as the input feature of an artificial neural network. Mutual information method is applied in this paper for computing the delay time parameter of EEG signals. The results indicate that the delay time values of EEG signals during an epileptic seizure become larger than those of normal EEG signals obviously, and then this phenomenon is utilized for automated epileptic EEG detection combined with probabilistic neural networks (PNN). Delay time parameter is used as the input feature of the neural network for the first time for the detection of epilepsy. It is shown that the overall accuracy as high as 100% can be achieved by using the method proposed in this paper.","","978-1-4244-1747-6","978-1-4244-1748-3","10.1109/ICBBE.2008.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4535002","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Delay effects;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Information analysis;Mutual information;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Signal analysis;Time series analysis","electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neural nets","artificial neural network;delay time-based epileptic EEG detection;electroencephalogram signal;epilepsy diagnosis;neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection;probabilistic neural networks","","0","","12","","","16-18 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments with subjects navigating in physically impossible environments indicate that the basic human representation of space cannot be map-like. Rather, it seems to be sensori motor in nature, combining sensory features with motor actions. We argue that such a sensori motor representation is important for the design of artificial systems that have to deal with spatial data. Here we demonstrate that this refers to both autonomous systems for spatial exploration and navigation and to systems for human assistance, in particular a navigation assistance and training system for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disorientation and getting lost behavior are early signs of AD in most patients. The proposed system will focus on cognitive deficits associated with the disease by using and training skills that are still likely to be intact in the individual person. By means of guiding the attention to salient and autobiographically important landmarks, and practicing routes between them, the system will help to build up and train a more resilient sensori-motor representation. The user interface focuses on combining the visual scenes of the incorporated landmarks with a simplified map of the surrounding area.","","978-1-4673-1536-4","","10.1109/ICIS.2012.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211100","alzheimer;assistance system;dementia;disorientation;navigation;sensorimotor;spatial cognition;virtual reality","Alzheimer's disease;Buildings;Navigation;Training;Virtual environments;Visualization","computer based training;diseases;handicapped aids;health care;human computer interaction;multi-agent systems;user interfaces","Alzheimer disease;artificial system design;assistive devices;autonomous systems;bio-inspired representation;motor actions;navigation assistance;sensory features;space sensorimotor representation;spatial exploration;spatial navigation;training system;user interface;visual scenes;wayfinding assistant","","0","","26","","","May 30 2012-June 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Spam blogs are problematic in extracting useful marketing information from the blogosphere; they often appear to be rich sources of information based on individual opinion and social reputation. One characteristic of spam blogs is copied-and-pasted articles based on normal blogs and news articles. Another is multiple postings of the same article to increase the chances of exposure and income from advertising. Because of these characteristics, spam blogs share common keywords, and such blogs and keywords can form large spam bi-clusters. Based on such clusters, this paper explains how to detect spam blogs and spam keywords with mutual filtering. It reports that the maximum precision of the filtering is 95%, based on a preliminary experiment with approximately six months' updated blog data and a more detailed experiment with one day's data.","","978-1-4244-4614-8","978-1-4244-4615-5","10.1109/NDT.2009.5272171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272171","","Advertising;Bipartite graph;Blogs;Costs;Data mining;Filtering;Information resources;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","Web sites;advertising data processing;e-mail filters;information filtering;pattern clustering;unsolicited e-mail","advertising;cooccurrence cluster seed;copied-and-pasted article;marketing information extraction;mutual detection mechanism;social reputation;spam bi-cluster;spam blogosphere filtering;spam keyword","","0","","4","","","28-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our results show that the M2E delay depends mainly on the receiving end-point. Hardware IP phones, when acting as receivers, usually achieve a low average M2E delay (45-90 ms) under low jitter conditions. Software clients achieve an average M2E delay from 65 ms to over 400 ms, depending on the actual implementation. All tested end-points can compensate for clock skew, although some suffer from occasional playout buffer underflow. Only a few of the tested end-points support silence suppression. We find that these silence detectors have a relatively long hangover time (> 0.5 sec), and they may falsely detect music as silence. All hardware IP phones we tested support some form of packet loss concealment better than silence substitution. The concealment generally works well for two to three consecutive losses at 20 ms packet intervals, but voice will quickly deteriorate beyond that.","","0-7803-7802-4","","10.1109/ICC.2003.1203932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203932","","Circuits;Clocks;Computer science;Delay estimation;Detectors;Hardware;Information technology;Internet telephony;Quality of service;Testing","Internet telephony;delay estimation;interference suppression;quality of service;telephone sets","45 to 90 ms;QoS evaluation;VoIP end point;clock skew;hardware IP phones;mouth to ear;packet loss;silence suppression behavior;voice over IP","","10","","","","","11-15 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the use of Ta sacrifices the drawability of the precursor wires, increasing the risk of wire breakage during drawing. In this work, a new layout intended to balance drawability and interfilament decoupling is proposed. In this new layout, Nb barrier filaments are concentrated around the central dummy core, and Ta barrier filaments are located so as to magnetically decouple the Nb barrier filaments in the outer filamentary region. The drawability and magnetization behavior of the newly designed Nb<sub>3</sub>Al wires are compared with those of conventional wires.","1051-8223","","","10.1109/TASC.2012.2235519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6414596","<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$hbox{Nb}_{3}hbox{Al}$</tex></formula>;Drawability;interfilament coupling;low field instability","Conductors;Couplings;Magnetization;Niobium;Superconducting magnets;Wires","aluminium alloys;drawing (mechanical);ductility;fracture;magnetisation;multifilamentary superconductors;niobium alloys;tantalum","Nb barrier filaments;Nb<sub>3</sub>Al-Ta;Ta barrier filaments;central dummy core;drawing;high-melting-point matrix material;interfilament decoupling;liquid He temperature;low-field instability;magnetic interfilament coupling;outer filamentary region;precursor wire drawability;transformation-processed conductor design;wire breakage;wire magnetization behavior","","0","","6","","2013-01-17","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we model this as an optimization problem which minimize upload bandwidth and is constrained with a maximum acceptable download time. Solving this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which has the benefit of low complexity and can be implemented with low computation and communication overhead.","","978-4-88552-232-1","978-4-88552-231-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773844","","Analytical models;Application software;Bandwidth;Computer science;Constraint optimization;IP networks;Iterative algorithms;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;bandwidth allocation;computational complexity;iterative methods;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer networks;Internet;communication overhead;computation complexity;file sharing systems;iterative algorithm;network traffic;optimization problem;resource allocation;upload bandwidth sharing","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eros computes the similarity between two MTS items by measuring how close the corresponding principal components (PCs) are using the eigenvalues as weights. Since the weights are based on the data items in the database, they change whenever data are inserted into or removed from the database. In this paper, we propose a distance-based index structure, Muse (Multilevel distance-based index structure for Eros), for efficient retrieval of MTS items using Eros. Muse constructs each level as a distance-based index structure without using the weights, up to z levels. At the query time, Muse combines the z levels with the weights, which enables the weights to change without the need to rebuild the index structure. In order to show the efficiency of Muse, we performed several experiments on a set of synthetically generated clustered datasets. The results show the superiority of Muse as compared to sequential scan and M-tree in performance.","1530-1311","0-7695-2370-6","","10.1109/TIME.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443353","","Application software;Biomedical imaging;Computer science;Covariance matrix;Databases;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Euclidean distance;Magnetic field measurement;Personal communication networks;Principal component analysis","data structures;database indexing;principal component analysis;time series","Eros;Muse;PCA;extended Frobenius norm;multilevel distance-based index structure;multivariate time series;principal component analysis","","1","","16","","","23-25 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IWSN acts as one of the fundamental elements of the IoT infrastructure to bridge the physical sensors and actuators in field and backbone systems in the Internet. For deterministic performances, all mainstream IWSN standards utilize the slotted media access control (MAC) where the communication is allocated based on the superframe that comprises a number of slots in either contention-based access or contention-free access modes. In this paper, the planning of the superframe structure of the slotted MAC is investigated by two means: 1) a mathematical model of the MAC access latency based on the queue theory; and 2) an easy-to-use software tool based on packet-level simulation. The mathematical model gives an overall estimation of the average MAC access latency of the whole network. The software tool gives the exact latency of each packet and then can derive the optimal superframe structure of the network. The two means are validated correspondingly. With the methods proposed in this paper, IWSN designers can minimize the MAC access latency while satisfying the requirements at different generating rates of packet, number of nodes in the network, and packet buffer length of each node.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2014.2306776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742617","IEEE 802.15.4;Internet-of-things (IoT);industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN);packet latency model;slotted MAC;superframe planning","Delays;Mathematical model;Media Access Protocol;Planning;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;access protocols;queueing theory;software tools;wireless sensor networks","IWSN;Internet of things;IoT;MAC access latency;contention-based access;contention-free access;industrial wireless sensor network;packet buffer length;packet level simulation;queue theory;slotted MAC;slotted media access control;software tool;superframe planning","","1","","","","2014-02-17","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Current research for these protocols generally uses an ack-based approach and consists of mobile support stations and supervisor hosts. Each supervisor host controls a group of neighboring mobile support stations by delivering one ack message to the sender and collecting ack messages from all the mobile hosts that are joined in a multicast group and are in its domain. But if either the number of mobile hosts in the supervisor host's domain is increased or the mobile hosts crowd around a particular supervisor host, an ack implosion of the supervisor host can occur because of the number of ack messages from mobile hosts. To solve the problem, we propose the HARM approach, a reliable multicast protocol that hierarchically processes ack messages in both the mobile support station and the supervisor host to alleviate the ack messages","","0-7695-0777-8","","10.1109/ICON.2000.875814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875814","","Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Handheld computers;Intelligent networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Multicast communication;Multicast protocols;Portable computers;Telecommunication network reliability","cellular radio;multicast communication;radio networks;telecommunication network reliability;transport protocols","HARM approach;IP;Internet protocol;ack messages;cellular radio;hierarchical ack-based protocol;mobile hosts;mobile networks;mobile support stations;multicast group;personal computing devices;reliable multicast communication;reliable multicast protocol;simulation model;supervisor hosts","","0","2","9","","","2000","05 Sep 2000-08 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ECG typically consists of three important component waves, called the P, QRS, and T waves, which provide clinical information about the functioning of the heart. An important problem in ECG signal processing is that of delineation of the ECG component waves. The delineation of the P wave is difficult in certain cardiac diseases where the P wave overlaps the other ECG component waves. We present an innovative algorithm, for the delineation of the P waves, which works well even in such cases.

The resulting pole-zero filter is then decomposed into a set of unique partial fractions (PF), with each PF representing a sub-component or a fractional component (FC) of the ECG.

Airway resistance has, in the past, been noted as variable, and this variability has been connected to pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma). A hypothesis was presented many years ago that postulated airway resistance as an optimized parameter in healthy individuals, and we have noticed that respiratory measurements made with the airflow perturbation device (APD) tend to be variable in nature. It was posited that this variability indicates that respiratory resistance is optimized similarly to other physiological processes. Fifty subjects with a wide range of demographics volunteered to have 100 measurements made of their respiratory resistances. Resistances were separated into inhalation and exhalation phases. These were plotted and shown to have frequency distributions that were consistent with expectations for an optimized process. The frequency distributions were not quite symmetrical, being skewed slightly toward upper resistances. Comparison between subject data and data from a mechanical respiratory analog showed that subject resistance variation is overwhelmingly from the respiratory system and not from the APD.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2204055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215025","Airflow perturbation device;asthma;respiration","Correlation;Electrical resistance measurement;Humans;Immune system;Resistance;Standards;Testing","biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;cardiology;diseases;gait analysis;pneumodynamics","airflow perturbation device;airway caliber;cardiac function;exhalation phases;mechanical respiratory;optimization;optimized processing;physiological processing;physiologically optimized processing;postulated airway resistance;pulmonary disease;respiratory measurements;respiratory resistances;subject resistance variation;walking","Adolescent;Adult;Airway Resistance;Asthma;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Respiratory Function Tests;Respiratory Mechanics","0","","32","","2012-06-11","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Speaker data is represented as Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) vectors, and features are compared using the KL2 metric to form clusters of speech segments for each speaker. We make two observations with respect to clustering based on KL2: 1.) The accuracy of clustering is strongly dependent on the absolute lengths of the speech segments and their extracted feature vectors. 2.) The accuracy of the similarity measure strongly degrades with the length of the shorter of the two speech segments. These effects of length can be attributed to the measure of covariance used in KL2. We demonstrate an empirical correction of this sample-size effect that increases clustering accuracy. We draw parallels to two vector quantization-based (VQ) similarity measures, one which exhibits an equivalent effect of sample size, and the second being less influenced by it.","","978-1-4244-2570-9","978-1-4244-2571-6","10.1109/ICME.2008.4607737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4607737","","Computer science;Degradation;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Labeling;Length measurement;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Size measurement;Speech;Symmetric matrices","pattern clustering;quantisation (signal);speaker recognition","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;feature matrices;sample size effect;similarity measures;speaker clustering;speaker data;speech segments;symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance;vector quantization","","3","","7","","","June 23 2008-April 26 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed voltage compensation control method based on the voltage amplitude change rate achieve accurate reactive power sharing and the system voltage stability. The dynamic performance is also improved. The small-signal model analysis verifies that matched parameters can greatly affect the transient response, and appropriate parameter design is good for the improvement of dynamic performance.

The information of pre-steps is encrypted by cipher and embedded in the second category of AC coefficients. So our scheme is also well supported by cryptographic theory.

DTC is a high performance motor control scheme with fast torque and flux responses. However, the main disadvantage of conventional DTC is electromagnetic torque ripple. Besides, the matrix converter is a single-stage ac-ac power conversion device without dc-link energy storage elements. Due to the properties of the matrix converter, the pseudo dc-link will provide with three different types of voltage: the high, middle, and low voltages. Therefore, based on space vector modulation generated by a matrix converter, there are three states on each space vector location. By suitably selecting switching pattern, the electromagnetic torque ripple of the motor is effectively reduced. Using this switching strategy, the advantages of the DTC schemes and the benefits of the matrix converters can be combined. As a result, a satisfactory servo drive can be achieved.","","0-7695-2882-1","","10.1109/ICICIC.2007.268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427746","","Capacitors;Control systems;Energy storage;Hysteresis motors;Induction motor drives;Inverters;Matrix converters;Motor drives;Torque control;Voltage","AC-AC power convertors;induction motor drives;machine control;matrix convertors;modulation;torque control","direct torque control;electromagnetic torque ripple;fed induction motor drive systems;matrix converter;motor control scheme;pseudo dc-link;servo drive;single-stage ac-ac power conversion device;space vector modulation;switching strategy","","6","","8","","","5-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Low-cost manufacturing strategy for miniature packaging","Nguyen, L.; Lee, S.; Takiar, H.","Nat. Semicond. Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium, 1998. Twenty-Third IEEE/CPMT","20020806","1998","","","473","477","The common view is that as packages decrease in size, as with chip scale packages (CSPs), the cost becomes a major impediment to implementation for high volume production. However, cost is only one aspect. In some cases, even though the cost is higher than standard equivalent surface mount packages, CSPs are still used due to the benefits obtained from miniaturization. Furthermore, current market trends show that CSP costs are falling rapidly, at least with the high volume memory products. In the longer term, the adoption of CSPs will match with the ability of the PCB infrastructure to supply cost-effective substrates. This paper discusses a manufacturing approach for CSPs to produce lower overall cost-of-ownership. The strategy centers on an organic substrate-based CSP that simplifies the back end manufacturing flow, from chip attach to wire bonding to molding through testing and singulation. Devices are attached to the strip-like substrate with designs routed out into a matrix format. This design allows the various assembly operations to be performed on existing equipment tailored previously for leadframe-based packages rather than with dedicated (and expensive) tools. Hence, more flexibility can be obtained from the assembly facilities, which are already equipped with standard equipment, boosting at the same time the machines utilization efficiency. The concept has been demonstrated for 8-lead devices and below. It has been extended to 16-, 20-, 24-, 28-, 48-, 64-, and 100-lead devices, with higher pin counts under development","1089-8190","0-7803-4523-1","","10.1109/IEMT.1998.731174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=731174","","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Assembly;Bonding;Chip scale packaging;Costs;Production;Pulp manufacturing;Surface impedance;Testing;Wire","chip scale packaging;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;lead bonding;moulding;network routing","CSP cost;CSP costs;CSPs;assembly facilities flexibility;assembly operations;back end manufacturing flow;chip attach;chip scale packages;cost-effective substrates;cost-of-ownership;design routing;device attach;equivalent surface mount packages;leadframe-based packages;machines utilization efficiency;manufacturing cost;manufacturing strategy;market trends;matrix format;miniature packaging;miniaturization;molding;organic substrate-based CSP;package size;pin count;singulation;strip-like substrate;testing;volume memory products;volume production;wire bonding","","1","","3","","","19-21 Oct 1998","19 Oct 1998-21 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, this paper trades off the potential advantages and drawbacks of using local data as compared to multi-organizational data. Motivated by the results from previous investigations, we further analyzed a large cost database from Finland that collects standard cost factors and includes information on six individual companies. Each of these companies provided data for more than ten projects. This information was used to compare the accuracy between company-specific (local) and company-external (global) cost models. They show that company-specific models seem not to yield better results than the company external models.

A typical AC structure consists of two interacting NNs which is computationally expensive. In this paper, a new architecture, called the ""Cost Function Based Single Network Adaptive Critic (J-SNAC)"" is presented that eliminates one of the networks in a typical AC structure. This approach is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear systems in engineering. Many real-life problems have controller limits.

With the advent of smart-phones equipped with MEMS sensors, it has become possible to utilize ones orientation information along with location. This combination has allowed researchers to investigate provisioning users with orientation aware location based services as well as seamless navigation in different environments using Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) techniques. Although gyroscopes are considered to be the primary sensors for orientation estimation, the errors associated with these sensors require periodic updates from other sources. In case of small hand held devices, these other sources are accelerometers for roll and pitch estimates and magnetic field sensors for the heading. In order to utilize the magnetic field sensors for heading estimation with respect to some known reference, it is desirable to measure only the Earth's magnetic field components. Although this is achievable in the outdoors, presence of manmade infrastructure in all kinds of urban environments makes it impossible to sense only the Earth's magnetic field at all times. These manmade magnetic anomalies caused by electronic devices, ferrous materials, mechanical and electrical infrastructures among others are the main culprits contaminating the magnetic field information. Therefore it is desirable to investigate how good one can estimate the heading using magnetic field alone in different pedestrian navigation environments by isolating the perturbed regions from the clean ones. In this paper, a detector is proposed that can identify the magnetic field measurements that can be used for estimating heading with adequate accuracy. The expected errors in the heading estimates are also output based on the test statistics, which allow the proposed detector to be utilized for sensor fusion and estimation of errors associated with gyroscopes. Real world data is acquired using a custom designed consumer grade sensor- - platform and a high accuracy reference system. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed detector is capable of identifying the effects of perturbations on the Earth's magnetic field, which provides users with a better estimate of magnetic heading in different pedestrian navigation environments.","","978-1-4577-1805-2","978-1-4577-1803-8","10.1109/IPIN.2011.6071947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6071947","Indoor Orientation Estimation;Magnetic Field;Pedestrian Navigation","Detectors;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic fields;Magnetic sensors;Magnetometers;Navigation","magnetic field measurement;microsensors;navigation","MEMS sensors;accelerometers;electrical infrastructures;electronic devices;ferrous materials;gyroscopes;magnetic anomalies;magnetic field based heading estimation;magnetic field measurements;magnetic field sensors;orientation aware location based services;pedestrian dead reckoning;pedestrian navigation environments;smart-phones","","7","","15","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model, obtained on training sets extracted from the intensity, allows us to reduce the classification errors concerning each pixel of the image. The proposed segmentation algorithm has been applied to biomedical images in order to detect a kind of skin cancer (melanoma). In a second step, features concerning the lesion are extracted using color information. These features are used in order to classify the benign lesions (naevus) from the other.

Independent and coordinated checkpointing have been adopted in many works on fault tolerant mobile agent (MA) systems. However, CIC, a flexible, efficient, and scalable checkpointing scheme, has not been applied to MA systems. Based on the analysis of the behavior of mobile agent, we argue that CIC is a well suited checkpointing scheme for MA systems. CIC not only establishes the consistent recovery lines efficiently but also integrates well with the independent checkpointing for reliable MA migration. Here, we propose an important improvement to CIC, referred to as the deferred message processing based CIC algorithm (DM-CIC), which achieves higher efficiency by exempting the CIC algorithm from making the forced checkpoints in MA systems. Through simulation, we find out that DM-CIC is stable and better suited to large scale MA systems.","","0-7695-2673-X","","10.1109/SKG.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5727641","","","checkpointing;fault tolerant computing;mobile agents","CIC algorithm;consistent recovery lines;coordinated checkpointing;fault tolerance;fault tolerant mobile agent system;message processing;scalable checkpointing scheme","","2","","21","","","1-3 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The general approach of couching the satisfaction of test goals as numerical optimisation problems has been applied to a variety of problems such as satisfying structural coverage criteria, specification falsification, exception generation, breaking unit pre-conditions and software hazard discovery. However, some test goals may be hard to satisfy. For example, a program branch may be difficult to reach via a search based technique, because the domain of the data that causes it to be taken is exceedingly small or the non-linearity of the ""fitness landscape'' precludes the provision of effective guidance to the search for test data. In this paper we propose to ""stretch'' relevant conditions within a program to make them easier to satisfy. We find test data that satisfies the corresponding test goal of the stretched program. We then seek to transform the stretched program by stages back to the original, simultaneously migrating the obtained test data to produce test data that satisfies the goal for the original program. The ""stretching'' device is remarkably simple and shows significant promise for obtaining hard-to-find test data and also gives efficiency improvements over standard search based testing approaches.","","978-0-7695-3675-0","","10.1109/SSBSE.2009.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5033191","Program Stretching;Program Transformation;Search based test data generation;Simulated Annealing","Automatic testing;Automation;Computer science;Costs;Hazards;Performance evaluation;Programming;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing","numerical analysis;optimisation;program testing","automated software test data generation;breaking unit pre-conditions;exception generation;numerical optimisation problems;program stretching;search based software testing;software hazard discovery;specification falsification;structural coverage criteria","","1","","35","","","13-15 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CCD is required to have high quantum efficiency (QE) at near-infrared wavelengths, low noise and dark current, and an rms spatial resolution of less than 4 mum. In order to optimize the spatial resolution and QE, requirements that have conflicting dependences on the substrate thickness, it is necessary to operate the CCD at large substrate-bias voltages. In this paper, we describe the features of the CCD, summarize the performance, and discuss in detail the device-design techniques used to realize 200-mum-thick CCDs that can be operated at substrate-bias voltages in excess of 100 V.","0018-9383","","","10.1109/TED.2009.2030631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280320","Charge-coupled device (CCD);fully depleted;high voltage;high-resistivity substrate;static induction transistor (SIT)","Charge coupled devices;Dark current;Dark energy;Electromagnetic wave absorption;Proposals;Silicon;Space technology;Spatial resolution;Telescopes;Voltage","CCD image sensors;dark conductivity;elemental semiconductors;silicon","12.3-megapixel charge-coupled device;CCD;Si;back-illuminated charge-coupled device;dark current;dark energy;device-design techniques;fully depleted charge-coupled device;high-resistivity n-type silicon;high-voltage compatible charge-coupled device;near-infrared wavelengths;quantum efficiency;size 200 mum;substrate thickness;substrate-bias voltage","","6","1","29","","2009-10-06","Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is the consequence of the development of the fast multipole algorithms (FMA) and the multilevel fast multipole algorithms (MLFMA). Such algorithms allow a matrix-vector multiplication to be performed in O(NlogN) operations or less for many scattering problems. Moreover, the memory requirements of these methods are O(NlogN), or almost matrix free. Using the fast matrix-vector multiplications in an iterative solver, problems for integral equations involving millions of unknowns have been solved previously. One of the most important mathematical formulas in FMA is the addition theorem. In the numerical implementation of the addition theorem, the infinite series should be truncated. The error analysis for the truncation error in the scalar Green's functions has been done by many researchers. In this paper, the error analysis for the truncation error in the multipole expansion of vector Green's functions is given.","","0-7803-5639-x","","10.1109/APS.1999.789217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=789217","","Computational electromagnetics;Electromagnetic scattering;Error analysis;Finite wordlength effects;Green's function methods;Integral equations;Iterative algorithms;MLFMA;Polynomials;Sampling methods","Green's function methods;electromagnetic wave scattering;error analysis;integral equations;iterative methods","addition theorem;computational electromagnetics;error analysis;fast multipole algorithms;finite series;infinite series;integral equations;iterative solver;matrix-vector multiplication;memory requirements;multilevel fast multipole algorithms;multipole expansion;scattering problems;truncation;vector Green's functions","","4","","13","","","11-16 July 1999","11 Jul 1999-16 Jul 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With respect to such a selective management scheme, we derive probabilistic guarantees on the percentage of nodes to be managed. Our contribution is centered on a distributed self-organizing management algorithm at the application layer, its efficient deployment into a management architecture and on a comprehensive simulation study.

The ultimate ""output"" sensitivity ε_{V}=<deltaPhimin{x}max{2}>/2LDeltaf is shown to be substantially less than the Planck's constant h, for the both types of SQUIDs. This result does not contradict to the uncertainty principle, because the ""total"" sensitivity ε=(ε_{V}ε_{I}-εmin{IV}max{2})^{1/2} rather than ε_{V} is an adequate figure of merit of SQUID as a linear amplifier. The total sensitivity is shown to be, in fact, limited by the quantum fluctuations, ε>h/2. These fluctuations originate in the shunting resistances of the dc SQUID, while in the ac SQUID they are due to quantum noise of the following stage of amplification.

The evaluation function considers error rate of decision tree over the test set. Three common operators for genetic algorithm such as random mutation and single-point crossover is applied for the population. Finally the algorithm returns an individual with the highest fitness as a local optimal weight. Based on four databases from UCI, we compared our approach with several other traditional decision tree pruning techniques including cost-complexity pruning, Pessimistic Error Pruning and Reduced error pruning.

In the presence of a small dc magnetic field applied in the hard direction and equal to the anisotropy field, the resulting permeability is very high, and thus the inductance of the pattern is greatly increased. Since the inductance is a function of the dc magnetic field applied in the hard direction, variable inductors and tunable planar resonant circuits are readily implemented using the proposed device.

In this paper, we conclude that the impedance criterion directly dependent on output impedance Z/sub o/(s) of the source subsystem and input impedance Z/sub i/(s) of the load subsystem is possible but gives an incorrect stability analysis for systems with a regulated source subsystem. Through introducing a mapped pure impedance of the load subsystems and the preliminary system, we develop a general three-step impedance criterion, with which a correct small-signal stability analysis can be guaranteed, regardless of the type of source subsystem. Furthermore, we introduce the application of the three-step impedance criterion in two small-signal stability analysis cases and utilize it in an example system to predict the stability shift process arising from the variation on the load resistance and input voltage value.","1540-7985","","","10.1109/LPEL.2003.822371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257352","","Impedance;Mathematical model;Power system analysis computing;Power system modeling;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Stability criteria;System performance;Transfer functions;Voltage","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;electric impedance;power supplies to apparatus;stability","impedance criterion;input impedance;load resistance;load subsystem;mapped pure impedance;minor loop gain method;output impedance;pulse-width-modulation controlled DC-DC converters;regulated source subsystem;small-signal stability analysis;small-signal stability analysis methods;stability analysis;stability shift process;three-step impedance criterion;two-stage DC distributed power systems","","11","","16","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately effects like limited accuracy and time delay occur, which are the main inherent problems of vision sensors. The effects and related compensation approaches are studied in this work. The main goal of the work is to develop an approach to combine suitable measurement devices easy to realize with improved reliability. The task to be solved is to combine the estimations of the variable gain observer (based on vision measurements) with those of the variable gain observer (based on potentiometers). Realizing a multi-model approach the variable gain controller uses the estimated states and the roll angle to generate the required damping to control the system. Simulation results show that the variable gain observers can estimate the states and the unknown disturbance acting on the payload very well and the variable gain controller can reduce effectively the payload pendulations.","","978-1-4673-1871-6","978-1-4673-1870-9","10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6485420","","Cameras;Cranes;Delay effects;Gain;Mathematical model;Observers;Robot sensing systems","cameras;compensation;cranes;damping;deformation;elasticity;gain control;image sensors;observers;reliability;vibration control","camera;compensation;complex dynamic vibration;contactless measurement sensor;damping;deformation measurement;elastic-ship mounted crane;measurement device;multimodel approach;payload pendulation;potentiometer;reliability;roll angle;ship-mounted elastic crane control;state variable estimation;system control;variable gain control;variable gain observer estimation;vision measurement;vision sensor data","","0","","11","","","5-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proposes an approach for enhancing aspect-oriented software development considering aspects as first-class design entities. The proposal puts together lines of research coming from different fields, namely: aspect-oriented frameworks, aspect models extending UML models, knowledge-driven framework documentation and agent-based planning. The concept of smart-weaving promotes essentially an early incorporation of aspects in the development cycle, so that designers are able to specify their designs by means of aspect models, reuse parts of these models, and also provide different strategies to map generic aspect structures to specific implementations. With this purpose, we have built an experimental environment called Smartweaver aiming to support this process. The kind of assistance provided by the tool relies on the Smartbooks method, a method extending traditional techniques for framework documentation. Smartbooks includes a special planning agent that is able to derive the sequence of activities that should be executed to implement a given functionality from a target framework.","","1-58113-472-X","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008051","","Bridges;Computer aided software engineering;Documentation;Engines;Permission;Programming;Proposals;Technology planning;Unified modeling language","computer aided software engineering;object-oriented programming;planning (artificial intelligence);software agents","Aspect-Moderator Framework;Smartbooks method;Smartweaver;UML models;activity sequence derivation;agent-based planning;aspect models;aspect-oriented frameworks;aspect-oriented software development;first-class design entities;framework documentation;generic aspect structures;implementation mapping;knowledge-driven framework documentation;model reuse;planning agent;software design specification","","0","","","","","25-25 May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This reality has been consolidated because, currently, tasks such as obtainment, manipulation, sharing and exploitation of large amounts of data are common and require many computational resources, so cloud computing can contribute because it can provide this resources indefinitely, including processing, memory, storage and others, all them for immediate use. Cloud computing has many challenges, among them, the specification of work platforms in a cloud environment. In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers. The use of concepts of Service Level Agreements - SLA to control the utilization of computational resources of a provider is common in computing environments and can be used to ensure the quality of services that being offered. The objective of this work is to combine these paradigms, cloud, models and SLA, in order to use the resources of a computational cloud to provide automatically a platform as a service - PaaS.

Pre- launch and on-orbit calibrations have been developed and applied to ensure accurate measurements over decades. But because of different designs as well as instrument aging effects, subsequent calibration is necessary to improve or maintain measurement accuracy. In-orbit inter-satellite radiometric calibration techniques could provide a long-term, group-wise solution. This paper presents our current research, which analyzes two methods to perform this calibration based upon coincident brightness measurements. In the first approach we build a transfer relationship based on three adjacent frequency measurements and major environmental parameters using radiative transfer model normalization. In the second approach, a linear regression is used among all frequency and both polarization measurements and their transforms. We utilize Radiative transfer models (RTM's) in both methods, and refine them under different environmental conditions and later, we test the RTM models in order to better simulate brightness temperature retrieval before use in building transfer relationships. We validate the two different approaches by comparing external measurements between AMSR on ADEOS-II and TMI on TRMM. Results of calibration comparisons are provided along with accuracy prediction and error source analysis. By pursuing this research, the feasibility of building calibrations between polar-orbit satellites can be established for improved operational and scientific utilization of microwave radiometer measurements.","","0-7803-9510-7","","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241175","","Aging;Brightness;Calibration;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency measurement;Instruments;Microwave radiometry;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Satellite broadcasting","calibration;geophysical equipment;radiative transfer;radiometers;remote sensing","ADEOS-II;AMSR;RTM;TMI;TRMM;accuracy prediction;adjacent frequency measurements;brightness temperature retrieval;calibration comparison;coincident brightness measurements;error source analysis;intersatellite microwave radiometer calibration;linear regression;on orbit calibration;polarization measurements;radiative transfer model normalization;total power microwave radiometer;transfer relationship","","2","","4","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method by which users are assigned to their respective frequency bands, termed 'band allocation', is an important part of assuring good performance in multiband CDMA systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to band allocation based on the transmission power as it is adjusted by power control. We investigate one such power-control-based algorithm that makes use of quality-based power control to switch users to another band when they reach the maximum transmission power. This algorithm is shown to provide a significant increase in capacity for high QoS requirements when compared with both wideband CDMA systems and other proposed band allocation algorithms for multiband CDMA. The capacity gain provided by the investigated algorithm substantiates our claim that power-control-based algorithms are a viable option for band allocation in multiband CDMA","","0-7803-7206-9","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.966298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966298","","Bandwidth;Base stations;Frequency;Intelligent networks;Multiaccess communication;Power control;Radio communication;Sensor systems;Switches;Wideband","cellular radio;channel allocation;channel capacity;code division multiple access;power control;quality of service;spread spectrum communication;telecommunication control","DS-CDMA;QoS requirements;band allocation;capacity;multiband CDMA;noncontiguous spectrum;performance;quality-based power control;third generation cellular systems;transmission power control","","1","1","","","","2001","25 Nov 2001-29 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many prior experiments have attempted to verify this principle, with surprisingly little success. These experiments have used several different algorithmic methods, a variety of graph interpretation questions on both real and fabricated data, and different presentation methods. However, none of the results have conclusively demonstrated the importance of mental map preservation on task performance. Our experiment measures the efficacy of the dynamic graph drawing in a different manner: we look at how memorable the evolving graph is, rather than how easy it is to interpret. As observed in the previous studies, we found no significant difference in terms of response time or error rate when preserving the mental map. While preserving the mental map is a good idea in principle, we find that it may not always support performance. However, our qualitative data suggests that, in terms of the user's perception, preserving the mental map makes memorability tasks easier. Our qualitative data also suggests that there may be two features of the dynamic graph drawing that may assist in their memorability: interesting subgraphs that remain visible over time and interesting patterns in node movement. The former is supported by preserving the mental map while the latter is not.","2165-8765","978-1-4673-0863-2","978-1-4673-0865-6","10.1109/PacificVis.2012.6183578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183578","","Animation;Context;Educational institutions;Error analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Time factors;Visualization","data visualisation;graph theory;information systems","algorithm designers;algorithmic methods;dynamic graph drawing;evolving graph;fabricated data;graph interpretation questions;memorability;mental map preservation;presentation methods;qualitative data","","1","","27","","","Feb. 28 2012-March 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a viable solution for protecting the integrity of the data stored in relational databases using fragile watermarking. Prior techniques for watermarking relational tables use secure hash to create a watermark that is stored in the least significant bits of some of the attributes. These techniques introduce distortions to the watermarked values and thus cannot be applied to all attributes. The proposed technique watermarks relational tables by reordering tuples relative to each other according to a secrete value.

However, the speed of water area extraction affects flood evaluation directly, which matters a lot to the rescue work after flood. To shorten the extracting time of water areas, parallelization process is used as one of the most efficient ways. Based on some normal methods frequently used in water area extraction, such as threshold method, NDVI, and so on, a new way is put forward, that is, to use Self-organized Feature Map to extract the water areas from ASAR images automatically and accurately, and then to analyze the SOM calculation flows to find out what influences the extraction speed, finally to optimize the calculation by using parallel I/O of parallel file system and the asynchronous parallel model of I/O hidden strategy.

Cloud computing should be able to meet the performance expectations of different classes of customers. However, inefficient scheduling algorithms decrease the quality of service experienced by users. To improve quality of service, several scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, these scheduling algorithms do not consider heterogeneous servers or different priority classes of customers. Our objective is to satisfy performance expectations of customers by proposing a Heterogeneous Dynamic Dedicated Server Scheduling (h-DDSS) while considering heterogeneous servers and different priority classes of customers. Results show that h-DDSS architecture can provide improved customer throughput and drop rate over homogeneous DDSS in cloud computing. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analysis will help cloud service providers build efficient cloud service architectures which are adaptable to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments by considering different types of priority class performances, such as, drop rate, throughput, and utilization.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883859","Cloud Computing;analytical modeling;heterogeneous;multi class;multi server;performance;queuing system","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Scheduling algorithms;Servers;Throughput","cloud computing;file servers;quality of service;scheduling","cloud computing;cloud service architectures;cloud service providers;h-DDSS architecture;heterogeneous dynamic dedicated servers scheduling;inefficient scheduling algorithms;performance expectations;quality of service","","0","","16","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is therefore important to manage this resource to be able to cast a structured (hierarchical) view into the activities of long video files to catalogue only interesting or relevant domain events. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel and efficient computational approach to ascertaining semantic segmentation of scene activities exhibited in monocular or multi-view surveillance videos. The key to achieve this is to derive the so-called dasiapacepsila descriptor, reflecting the change in underlying scene activities of a surveillance site, based on detecting key scene frames and modeling its temporal distribution. The former is performed by extracting 2D or 3D appearance-based subspace embedding features, followed by a time-constrained agglomerative data clustering. The latter models the density of such key frames distribution in the time domain, and then applies a visual curve segmentation algorithm to identify scene segments of different activities. The approach is especially suited for crowd scene segmentation, and it has been evaluated with real-world surveillance videos of both underground platforms and a busy industrial park entrance in rush hours with promising results.","","978-1-4244-4755-8","978-0-7695-3718-4","10.1109/AVSS.2009.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279492","crowded scene analysis;holistic approach;site activity segmentation;subspace embedding;video surveillance","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Layout;Resource management;Safety;Secure storage;Security;Smart cameras;Surveillance;Videos","feature extraction;image segmentation;pattern clustering;safety;video signal processing;video surveillance","agglomerative data clustering;busy industrial park entrance;computational approach;crowd scene segmentation;intelligence gathering purpose;key scene frame detection;mono-camera surveillance videos;monocular surveillance videos;multicamera surveillance videos;multiview surveillance videos;pace descriptor;resource management;safety purpose;scene activities;security purpose;semantic segmentation;subspace embedding feature extraction;temporal distribution modeling;underground platforms;visual curve segmentation algorithm","","0","1","11","","","2-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach is capable of preserving the topology of the template shape in the deformation. This property is achieved by inserting a set of additional points and imposing a set of linear equality and/or inequality constraints. The underlying optimization problem is solved using a quadratic programming algorithm. The proposed method has been tested using practical data in the context of shape-based image segmentation. Some relevant practical issues, such as missing detected landmarks and selection of the regularization parameter are also briefly discussed.","","0-7695-1950-4","","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238447","","Active contours;Active shape model;Application software;Biomedical imaging;Computer vision;Deformable models;Image segmentation;Shape measurement;Support vector machines;Topology","computer vision;feature extraction;image segmentation;quadratic programming;regression analysis;splines (mathematics);support vector machines;topology","SVM regression problem;fitting error;inequality constraints;landmark-based shape deformation;linear equality;nonrigid shape deformation;optimization problem;quadratic programming algorithm;regularization parameter;shape difference;shape-based image segmentation;support vector machine;template shape;thin-plate spline model;topology-preserving constraints","","2","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resulting filter structure based on these resonators, shows a considerable size reduction compared with the other microstrip bandpass filters based on other space-filling geometries designed at the same frequency. A second bandpass filter design based on the same resonator but with a tuning stub has been also presented, in an attempt to provide practically useful means to tune the filter to the specified performance with a considerable tuning range. The performance of the resulting filter structures has been evaluated using a method of moments (MoM) based electromagnetic simulator IE3D, from Zeland Software Inc. Results show that the proposed filter structures possess good return loss and transmission responses besides the size reduction gained, making them suitable for use in a wide variety of wireless communication applications.

During grid faults the reactive current control of the wind turbines should be used to support the grid voltage. With modern protection devices the fault durations are normally in a range of some hundred milliseconds or less. However this time window may be decisive for the stability of the conventional generators connected to the grid and consequently for the whole system. In this regard the dynamic response of the voltage support by the generation units is a very important issue. New German grid codes address this subject by specifying timing rules for the system response to grid faults. While wind turbines equipped with full-size converters can fulfil these rules with moderate effort due to their fast converter control, DFIG-based wind turbines are facing a new big challenge, which requires a dedicated control. This paper shows an extended control approach that deals with a highly dynamic response to grid faults. Simulation results prove the good performance of this control and validate it based on the new requirements.","1944-9925","978-1-4244-6549-1","978-1-4244-8357-0","10.1109/PES.2010.5589562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589562","Wind power;control system;doubly-fed induction generator;fault ride-through;grid codes;voltage support","","asynchronous generators;dynamic response;electric current control;power convertors;power generation control;power grids;wind turbines","DFIG-based wind turbines;German grid code requirements;dynamic performance evaluation;dynamic response;fast converter control;fault ride-through capability;full-size converters;grid faults;grid voltage;protection devices;reactive current control","","10","","11","","","25-29 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the chip size and number of SMs per chip increase, the frequency variation is also expected to increase, exacerbating the problem. The increased number of SMs also provides a unique opportunity: we can allocate resources to concurrently-executing applications based on how those applications are affected by the different available F<sub>max</sub> values. In this paper, we study the effects of per-SM clocking on spatial multitasking-capable GPUs. We demonstrate two factors that affect the performance of simultaneously-running applications: (i) the SM partitioning algorithm that decides how many resources to assign to each application, and (ii) the assignment of SMs to applications based on the operating frequencies of those SMs and the applications characteristics. Our experimental results show that spatial multitasking that partitions SMs based on application characteristics, when combined with per-SM clocking, can greatly improve application performance by up to 46% on average compared to cooperative multitasking with global clocking.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800390","","Business process re-engineering;Clocks;Frequency control;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Multitasking;Partitioning algorithms","graphics processing units;high level languages;multiprogramming","GPU;graphics processing units;high level programming languages;maximum operating frequencies;process variation aware workload partitioning algorithms;spatial multitasking;streaming multiprocessors;within die process variations","","0","","20","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Security-constrained unit commitment using Mixed-Integer Programming with Benders Decomposition","Laothumyingyong, N.; Damrongkulkamjorn, P.","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Kasetsart Univ., Bangkok, Thailand","Electrical Engineering/Electronics Computer Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON), 2010 International Conference on","20100624","2010","","","626","630","The objective of this paper is to determine the 24-hour unit commitment with minimum total generation cost subjecting to power flow constraints in both normal operating state and contingency state, which is considered the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). In this paper, the Benders' Decomposition technique has been applied by decomposing the problem into two parts: the master problem; and the subproblems. The master problem which is the unit commitment problem contains integer variables as the on-off status of the generating units, and therefore could be solved as Mixed-Integer Programming problem. The branch-and-cut method has been chosen to solve the master mixed-integer problem. There are two subproblems considered in this research: the power flow mismatch equations; and the operating limits of power systems. If the conditions in any subproblems are violated, the Benders Cuts corresponding to the violated constraints are added to the master problem and the mixed-integer unit commitment problem could be resolved. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 57-bus system with 7 thermal generating units. The 24-hour load data is made available along with the additional data for generating units. The results of typical unit commitment, security-constrained unit commitment under normal operating states and SCUC with contingency states are compared. The results show that the total generating costs of SCUC with contingency are higher than the others. However the committed units of that SCUC ensure that the system could still serve load when contingency occurs.","","978-1-4244-5606-2","978-1-4244-5607-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491412","","Cost function;Equations;Load flow;Mathematical model;Power engineering and energy;Power generation;Power system planning;Power system simulation;Power systems;System testing","integer programming;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power system security","Benders decomposition;IEEE 57-bus system;branch-and-cut method;generation units;integer variables;mixed-integer programming;power flow mismatch equation;security-constrained unit commitment","","1","","11","","","19-21 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The light level preferences vary amongst the various users specifically according to changing environment conditions. Thus, it is important when designing the illumination at various intelligent shared spaces to consider the preferences of users from different backgrounds. Hence, we propose a Fuzzy Logic-Multi Criteria Group Decision Making (FL-MCGDM) system which provides a comprehensive valuation from a group of decision makers utilizes General Type-2 Fuzzy Sets. We have carried out experiments in the intelligent apartment (iSpace) located in the University of Essex. The aggregation operation in the proposed method aggregates the various DMs opinions which allow handling the disagreements of DMs' opinions into a unique approval. In addition, the proposed system showed agreement between the proposed method and the real decision outputs from DMs (as quantified by the Pearson Correlation) which outperformed the FL-MCGDM systems based on Type-1 Fuzzy Sets, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets with Hesitation Index.","","","","10.1109/CEEC.2013.6659447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659447","general type-2 fuzzy sets;multi-criteria group decision making","Computer science;Decision making;Educational institutions;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Pragmatics;Uncertainty","decision making;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;lighting control;operations research","FL MCGDM system;Pearson correlation;changing environment conditions;decision makers;general type-2 fuzzy logic based multicriteria group decision making;general type-2 fuzzy sets;hesitation index;iSpace;illumination;intelligent apartment;intelligent environment;intelligent shared spaces;interval type-2 fuzzy sets;light level preferences;lighting level selection;reading comprehension;type-1 fuzzy sets","","0","","19","","","17-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The simulation results show that it has better de-noise effect than the conventional microphone array speech enhancement.","","978-1-4244-6892-8","978-1-4244-6893-5","10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5555762","adaptive beamforming;generalized sidelobe canceller;microphone array;multistage wiener filter","Array signal processing;Arrays;Microphones;Noise;Speech;Speech enhancement;Wiener filter","Wiener filters;array signal processing;filtering theory;speech enhancement","adaptive beamforming method;environment noise;generalized sidelobe canceller;post-multistage Wiener filter;speech communication systems;speech enhancement","","0","","9","","","5-7 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ninth International Conference on","20050919","2005","","","509","514","Capturing and modeling 3D information of the built environment is a big challenge. A number of techniques and technologies are now in use. These include EDM, GPS and photogrammetric application and also remote sensing applications. In this paper, we discussed 3D laser scanning technology, which can acquire high density point data in a accurate, fast way. Therefore, it can provide benefits for refurbishment process in the built environment. The scanner can digitize all the 3D information concerned with a building down to millimetre detail. A series of scans externally and internally allows an accurate 3D model of the building to be produced. This model can be ""sliced"" through different planes to produce accurate 2D plans and elevations. This novel technology improves the efficiency and quality of construction projects, such as maintenance of buildings or group of buildings that are going to be renovated for new services. Although data capture is more efficient using laser scanner than most other techniques, data modeling still presents significant research problems. These are addressed in this paper. The paper describes the research undertaken in the EU funded (FP6 IP) INTELCITIES project concerning 3D laser scanner technology for CAD modeling and its integration with various systems such as 3D printing and VR projection systems. It also considers research to be undertaken in the EU funded (INTERREG) virtual environmental planning systems (VEPS) project in the next 2 years. Following this, an approach for data modeling of scanned data is introduced, through which the information belonging to existing buildings can be stored in a database to use in building, urban, and regional scale models.","1550-6037","0-7695-2397-8","","10.1109/IV.2005.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509123","Laser scanner;built environment;data modeling;integration;objects recognition;visualization","Buildings;Data visualization;Design automation;Global Positioning System;Laser modes;Laser theory;Paper technology;Remote sensing;Space exploration;Virtual reality","CAD;building;computer graphic equipment;data visualisation;optical scanners;solid modelling;virtual reality","3D laser scanning;3D printing;CAD modeling;VR projection systems;built environment;data modeling;data visualization;laser scanner;object recognition;virtual environmental planning systems","","2","","12","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The clinical domain is one area in particular that, in principle has much to be gained from e-Science approaches. Until now however it has largely been the case that the practical realization, support and adoption of e-Science solutions in a clinical setting have been fraught by many hurdles. Not least is trust of technologies and their use in the field as opposed to demonstrator projects with non-real clinical data to prove the merit of e-Science ideas and solutions. The National e-Science Centre (NeSC– www.nesc.ac.uk) at the University of Glasgow have had a large number of clinical projects that have moved from the proof of concept demonstrators through to real systems used by real clinical researchers in real clinical trials and studies. In this paper we focus on the software systems that have been developed to support two major international post-genomic clinical research projects in the area of rare diseases: the European Union 7th Framework (EuroDSD – www.eurodsd.eu) project and the European Science Foundation (ENSAT – www.ensat.org) project.

The detection process includes pre-processing of the images, segmentation and post-processing, where objects not corresponding to areas of interest are eliminated through the utilization of rules expressing the medical knowledge. The preprocessing, segmentation and post-processing are differentiated depending on the areas that have to be detected (decalcification or occlusal areas).

In this study, we investigate yield, reliability, endurance, threshold voltages (forming, set and reset voltages) of ReRAM devices implemented in the back end of the line (BEOL). The focus of this study is on single ReRAM devices operated with an external transistor (1T1R configuration). Yield and endurance of these 1T1R configured devices show a strong dependence on device position on the wafer, the device size, and the current compliance used during the initial forming and subsequent set sweeps. Elevated temperatures resulted in a shift of the optimum operation conditions and could be used to improve device performance. Variance in performance of the ReRAM devices was directly correlated with manufacturing issues and material properties to gain maximum information for future improvements.","","978-1-4799-7308-8","","10.1109/IIRW.2014.7049535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049535","CMOS;ReRAM;endurance;hybrid;reliability","CMOS integrated circuits;Hafnium compounds;Reliability;Switches;Threshold voltage;Tin;Transistors","CMOS memory circuits;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;nanotechnology;resistive RAM","1T1R configuration;CMOS-ReRAM hybrid process;back end of the line;external transistor;flash memory replacement;fully integrated nanoscale ReRAM-CMOS combinations;integrated circuit yield;nonvolatile memory;on-wafer current control;resistive random access memory","","0","","","","","12-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This estimator is statistically analyzed and we show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be increased up to a factor equal to the number of available periods. The second estimator is similar to the former one but it avoids the use of those sample products more likely affected by noise. We prove that, under certain conditions, this estimator can remove the effect of an additive noise in a statistical sense. Both estimators are employed to extract mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as features for robust speech recognition. Although these estimators are initially conceived for voiced speech frames, we extend their application to unvoiced sounds in order to obtain a coherent feature extractor. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach over other MFCC-based front-ends such as the higher-lag autocorrelation spectrum estimation (HASE), which also employs the idea of avoiding those autocorrelation coefficients more likely affected by noise.","1558-7916","","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2053846","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492175","Acoustic noise;autocorrelation estimation;autocorrelation-based mel frequency cepstral coefficient (AMFCC);pitch-synchronous analysis;robust speech recognition","Acoustic noise;Additive noise;Autocorrelation;Feature extraction;Frequency estimation;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Noise robustness;Signal to noise ratio;Spectral analysis;Speech recognition","cepstral analysis;correlation methods;feature extraction;speech recognition","autocorrelation coefficient;autocorrelation sequence;feature extraction;higher lag autocorrelation spectrum estimation;mel frequency cepstral coefficient;periodic signal;pitch synchronous averaging;robust speech recognition;signal-to-noise ratio;speech signal frame;voiced speech frames","","2","","22","","2010-06-28","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

And the conductive material is dispensed by a nozzle. When the external pressure is applied to the sensor, the electrical signal of the conductive lines is changed. Consequently, to implement this kind of sensor, it is essential to examine dispensing conditions on the line fabrication. In this regards, we examined the conductive line fabrication characteristics by nozzle dispensing conditions. And it was found that the conductive material lines width decreases as the flow rate decreases and the nozzle moving speed increases.

Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on","20021107","2002","2","","935","942 vol.2","Littoral tracking refers to the tracking of targets on land and in sea near the boundary of the two regions. A ground-moving target continues to move on land and can not enter the sea. Similarly, a sea-moving target moves in the sea and the land serves as an infeasible region. Enforcing infeasible regions or hard constraints in the framework of the Kalman filter or interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator is not natural. However, these hard constraints can be easily enforced using the particle filter algorithm. We formulate the littoral tracking problem as a joint tracking and classification problem, where we assign a target class for each isolated land or water region. We use a reflecting boundary condition to enforce the region constraint. We demonstrate this concept for a single target using the airborne ground moving target indicator measurements. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm produces robust classification probabilities using kinematic measurements.","","0-9721844-1-4","","10.1109/ICIF.2002.1020912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020912","","Boundary conditions;Kinematics;Particle filters;Particle measurements;Particle tracking;Robustness;Sampling methods;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Target tracking","filtering theory;signal classification;target tracking","airborne ground moving target indicator measurements;ground-moving target;hard constraints;infeasible regions;joint tracking/classification problem;kinematic measurements;land;littoral tracking;particle filter algorithm;reflecting boundary condition;robust classification probabilities;sea-moving target;target class;target tracking","","7","","21","","","8-11 July 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system also adopts the open services gateway initiative (OSGi) platform, which can offer dynamically adjusted healthcare service programs for individual patients. In addition, ZigBee-built in wireless modules are used in the transmission of information between vital sign monitoring devices and the healthcare gateway. Vital sign data parameters, including ECG, SPO2, blood pressure, glucose and body temperature, can be transmitted to the healthcare gateway via ZigBee and then are relayed through the Internet to the health services information platform. This integrated healthcare system is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concept, providing a system that enables the healthcare management for individuals. As a result, round-the-clock telemedicine services can be provided for persons with chronic illnesses as well as the elderly.","","978-1-4244-2280-7","978-1-4244-2281-4","10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600108","HIS;Health Information System;OSGi;Open Service Gateway Initiative;SOA Service-Oriented Architecture;Telemedicine","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Service oriented architecture;Sugar;Telemedicine;Temperature;ZigBee","Web services;biomedical telemetry;patient monitoring;radiotelemetry;telemedicine","ZigBee;health services information platform;healthcare gateway;integrated healthcare system;open services gateway initiative;service-oriented architecture;telemedicine information monitoring system;vital sign data;wireless vital sign monitoring devices","","2","","6","","","7-9 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These results are compared with those of GaN/AlGaN QW lasers. With increasing sheet carrier density, both QW structures show that the exciton binding energy is significantly reduced, suggesting that excitons are nearly bleached at typical densities ( approximately 10<sup>13</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> ) for which lasing occurs. The flat-band model of the both QW structure shows that, with decreasing well width, the exciton binding energy increases due to the increasing confinement effect in the well. However, the self-consistent model of both QW structures shows that, with the inclusion of the internal field, the exciton binding energy is substantially reduced compared to that of the flat-band value. This is resulted from the smaller overlap due to spatial separation between the conduction and the valence wave functions as the well width gets larger. We also know that the exciton binding energy of ZnO/MgZnO QW structures is much larger than that of GaN/AlGaN QW structures. The larger exciton binding energy observed in ZnO/MgZnO QW structure can be explained by the larger matrix element than the GaN/AlGaN QW stucture, in addition to its smaller dielectric constant.","","978-1-4244-0540-4","978-1-4244-0541-1","10.1109/NMDC.2006.4388749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4388749","AlGaN;GaN;MgZnO;ZnO;exciton binding energy;polarization;quantum well","Aluminum gallium nitride;Bleaching;Charge carrier density;Excitons;Gallium nitride;Laser modes;Piezoelectric polarization;Quantum well lasers;Wave functions;Zinc oxide","II-VI semiconductors;binding energy;carrier density;excitons;magnesium compounds;piezoelectricity;semiconductor quantum wells;wave functions;wide band gap semiconductors;zinc compounds","ZnO-MgZnO;ZnO-MgZnO - Interface;conduction wave function;dielectric constant;exciton binding energies;piezoelectric polarizations;quantum well structures;self-consistent model;sheet carrier density;spontaneous polarizations;valence wave function","","0","","11","","","22-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In steady state, many adaptive filtering algorithms offer an unbiased estimation of both the reference signal and the unknown true parameter vector. In this correspondence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for adaptively biasing the weights of adaptive filters using an output multiplicative factor. We give theoretical results that show that the proposed configuration is able to provide a convenient bias versus variance tradeoff, leading to reductions in the filter mean-square error, especially in situations with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After reinterpreting the biased estimator as the combination of the original filter and a filter with constant output equal to 0, we propose practical schemes to adaptively adjust the multiplicative factor. Experiments are carried out for the normalized least-mean-squares (NLMS) adaptive filter, improving its mean-square performance in stationary situations and during the convergence phase.","1053-587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2047501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5443561","Adaptive filters;bias-variance tradeoff;biased estimation;combination filters","","adaptive filters;estimation theory;filtering theory;least mean squares methods","adaptive filtering algorithms;adaptively biasing;estimation theory;expected quadratic error;filter mean-square error;normalized least-mean-squares adaptive filter;signal-to-noise ratio","","9","","11","","2010-04-05","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In SMT process, small chip components prone to have tombstone defect Tombstone defect is defined when one of the component terminal stay intact whereas the other lifted up (Figure 1). The phenomenon occurred was mainly due to imbalance wetting force during reflow. Small component like 0402/0201 is rather light and delicate; the movement can be easily influenced by the surface tension between pad and molten solder. Imagine a small 0201 component has to balance the imbalance pulling force on its left and right terminals.

The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office's Composable Mission Space Environments program, seeks to develop concepts, technologies, and processes to enable the rapid, efficient, and flexible assembly of simulation systems from components. A workshop was held to examine the current state of composability, refine its definitions and intentions, identify capabilities and technologies needed to support practical composability, and propose research objectives and programmatic initiatives to move towards the goals of the Composable Mission Space Environments (CMSE) program. Approximately 35 experts from government, industry, and academia participated in four working groups (WGs). This paper reports the findings and recommendations of the data and metadata WG. The WG identified the crucial functions served by metadata descriptions of components in composable development, specified attributes of the components to be represented in the metadata, and sketched a high level concept of operations describing the roles and relationships of metadata stakeholders. This paper also reports the recommendations of all of the WGs for future actions in support of composability.","","0-7803-8786-4","","10.1109/WSC.2004.1371326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1371326","","Assembly systems;Collaboration;Government;Libraries;Network interfaces;Refining;Space missions;Space technology;Timing;User interfaces","digital simulation;meta data;user interfaces","assemble reusable simulation component;composable mission space environment;data requirement;defense modeling;metadata requirement;user interface;working group","","1","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Concept-based readability measurement and adjustment for web services descriptions","Sripairojthikoon, P.; Senivongse, T.","Dept. of Comput.

Among those standards is the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) which is an XML-based language for describing service descriptions. Service providers will publish WSDL documents of their Web services so that service consumers can learn about service capability and how to interface with the services. Since WSDL documents are the primary source of service information, readability of WSDL documents is of concern to service providers, i.e., service descriptions should be understood with ease by service consumers. Providing highly readable service descriptions can then be used as a strategy to attract service consumers. However, given highly readable information in the WSDL documents, competitors are able to learn know-how and can copy the design to offer competing services. Security attacks such as information espionage, client impersonation, command injection, and denial of service are also possible since attackers can learn about exchanged data and invocation patterns from WSDL documents. While readability of service descriptions makes Web services discoverable, it contributes to service vulnerability too. Service designers therefore should consider this trade-off when designing service descriptions. Currently there is no readability measurement for WSDL documents. We propose an approach to such measurement so that service designers can determine if readability is too low or too high with regard to service discoverability, service imitation, and service attack issues, and then can consider increasing or lowering service description readability accordingly. Our readability measurement is based on the concepts or terms in service domain knowledge. Given a WSDL document as a service description, readability is defined in terms of the use of difficult words in the description and the use of words that are key concepts in - he service domain. As an example, we measure readability of the WSDL document of E-commerce Web services, and experiment on redesigning of WSDL terms to adjust readability.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779196","Concept Hierarchy;Ontology;Readability;Web Services","Current measurement;Indexes;Materials;Ontologies;Web pages;Web services","Web services;XML;electronic data interchange;security of data;specification languages","WSDL documents;Web Services Description Language;Web services descriptions;XML-based language;client impersonation;command injection;communication standards;concept-based readability measurement;denial of service;distributed software applications;exchanged data;information espionage;information standards;invocation patterns;security attacks;service attack;service capability;service consumers;service description readability;service discoverability;service domain knowledge;service imitation;service information;service providers;service vulnerability","","0","","19","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the MDP could suffer from the complexity problem (i.e, curse of dimensionality). Therefore, we apply the simulation-based algorithm to obtain the optimal policy for the MDP. The algorithm can estimate the performance measure to update the policy gradient in an online fashion. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm uses parameters setting profiled from real mobile applications.

Any technology that can reduce the manual effort involved in this process therefore has the potential to significantly reduce software development costs and time consumption. An idea for achieving this is to reuse the knowledge bound up in already existing test cases, either directly or indirectly, to assist in the development of tests for new software components and systems. Although general software reuse has received a lot of attention in the past - both in academia and industry - previous research has focussed on the reuse and recommendation of existing software artifacts in the creation of new product code rather than on the recommendation of tests. In this paper we focus on the latter, and present a novel automated test recommendation approach that leverages lessons learned from traditional software reuse to proactively make test case suggestions while an engineer is developing tests. In contrast, most existing testing-assistance tools provide ex post assistance to test developers in the form of coverage assessments and test quality evaluations. Our goal is to create an automated, non-intrusive recommendation system for efficient software test development. In this paper we set out the basic strategy by which this can be achieved and present a prototypical implementation of our test recommender system for Eclipse.","","","","10.1109/IWAST.2013.6595799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595799","","Cloning;Indexes;Search engines;Software reusability;Testing;Writing","knowledge engineering;object-oriented programming;program testing;software fault tolerance;software quality;software reusability;software tools","Eclipse;automated test recommendation system;coverage assessments;defect tests development;domain knowledge;knowledge reuse;product code;software artifacts;software components;software development costs;software reuse;software test development;software time consumption;test cases;test quality evaluations;testing-assistance tools","","0","","24","","","18-19 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we examine the integration of tone-related acoustic features for Chinese recognition.. We propose the use of a cepstrum method (CEP), which uses the same window as in MFCC extraction, for the extraction of pitch-related features. The pitch periods extracted from the CEP algorithm can be used directly for speech recognition and do not require any special treatment for unvoiced frames. In addition, we explore a number of feature transformations and find that the addition of a properly normalized and transformed set of pitch related-features can reduce the recognition error rate from 34.61% to 29.45% on the Chinese 1998 National Performance Assessment (Project 863) corpus.","","0-7803-7488-6","","10.1109/ICOSP.2002.1181095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181095","","Cepstral analysis;Cepstrum;Data mining;Detection algorithms;Error analysis;Error correction;Hidden Markov models;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Natural languages;Speech recognition","cepstral analysis;feature extraction;speech recognition","Chinese;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;cepstrum method;pitch-related features;recognition error rate;speech recognition;tonal language;tone-related acoustic features;word differentiation","","0","","","","","26-30 Aug. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the case of Brazil, small hydro plants and cogeneration from sugarcane waste (bagasse) have been attractive alternatives during the past years, with hundreds of MW installed since 2004. Despite their advantages, both alternatives are hindered by seasonal yet complementary availability. This forces producers to discount (or price) the risks faced when selling firm energy contracts and may ultimately lead to projects being commercially unattractive. We propose a stochastic optimization model that defines the optimal composition of a portfolio based on these two renewable sources in order to maximize the revenue of an energy trading company. At the same time, this model mitigates hydrological and fuel unavailability risks, thus allowing the participation of both sources in the forward market environment in a competitive manner.

Such a radar coincidence imaging method resolves target scatterers based on measuring the independent waveforms of their echoes, which is quite different from conventional radar imaging techniques where target images are derived depending on time-delay and Doppler analysis. Due to the peculiar features of coincidence imaging, there are two potential advantages of the proposed imaging method over the conventional ones: 1) shortening the imaging time to even a pulse width without resolution deterioration so as to improve the performance of processing noncooperative targets and 2) simplifying the receiver complexity, resulting in a lower cost and platform flexibility in application. The basic principle of radar coincidence imaging is to employ the time-space independent detecting signals, which are produced by a multitransmitter configuration, to make scatterers located at different positions reflect independent waveforms from each other, and then to derive the target image based on the prior knowledge of this detecting signal spatial distribution. By constructing the mathematic model, the necessary conditions of the transmitting waveforms are analyzed for achieving radar coincidence imaging. A parameterized image-reconstruction algorithm is introduced to obtain high resolution for microwave radar systems. The effectiveness of this proposed imaging method is demonstrated via a set of simulations.

To solve this problem and make accurate assessment, we propose RAPCA-PP model on basis of Projection Pursuit theory to realize both risk assessment and attributes analysis. Due to Projection Pursuit's theoretical merits, RAPCA-PP is thoroughly data-driven, it can be applied to conditions with small sample quantity, incomplete data and no-prior experience. Using RAGA for solution, RAPCA-PP shows well convergence. Compared with Grey Relations Projection, it demonstrates both better accuracy and higher discrimination. Moreover, our model can analysis attributes by importance and eliminate redundancy. Experiment shows that assessment with eliminated attributes can also correctly reflect each node's performance.

The purpose of this panel is to help the designer and CAD manager determine how to properly compare extractors and how to put them to use. The panel will address a number of questions including; What is the best way to accurately handle parasitic extraction while dealing with increasingly large and complex (SOC, mixed signal) chips? How to determine and achieve the required extraction accuracy for a particular design situation? How is extraction accuracy measured? How can each extractor be compared and contrasted with some degree of confidence? Can circuit design techniques and/or tool methodologies be used to reduce the extraction effort?

To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that can capture the general performance properties for a class of multicore processors of interest over a large design space and workload space, free of scalability issues. The idea is to model multicore processors at the thread-level, overlooking instruction-level and micro architectural details. In particular, queuing network models that model multicore processors at the thread level are developed and solved based on an iterative procedure over a large design space and workload space. This framework scales to virtually unlimited numbers of cores and threads. The testing of the procedure demonstrates that the throughput performance for many-core processors with 1000 cores can be evaluated within a few seconds on an Intel Pentium 4 computer and the results are within 5% of the simulation data obtained based on a thread-level simulator.","1526-7539","978-1-4577-0468-0","","10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005353","CMP;design space exploration;manycore;multicore;queuing network","Analytical models;Approximation methods;Instruction sets;Mathematical model;Multicore processing;Servers","iterative methods;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;queueing theory","Intel Pentium 4 computer;design space exploration;instruction-level;iterative procedure;manycore processors;micro architectural details;multicore era;multicore processor design;optimal design;programming phase;queuing network;scalability issues;thread-level simulator;workload space","","2","","26","","","25-27 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method optimizes the spatially constrained Wiener filter for an efficiently parameterized model of the image autocorrelation based on a Markov random field (MRF) with affine transformation. The paper presents a closed-form solution to parameterize the model for an image. The enhancement method is computationally efficient, because it is formulated as convolution with a small kernel. Because the kernel is small, it can be optimized efficiently and only a small portion of the MRF autocorrelation model is required. Because the autocorrelation model parameters and optimal filter can be computed quickly, the method can be optimized locally for adaptive processing. Experimental results indicate that the new method can balance the error-budget tradeoff between signal error and aliasing error.","1522-4880","1-4244-0480-0","","10.1109/ICIP.2006.313062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107121","Image processing;Interpolation;Markov Process;Wiener Filter","Adaptive filters;Autocorrelation;Closed-form solution;Constraint optimization;Convolution;Image resolution;Kernel;Markov random fields;Optimization methods;Wiener filter","Markov processes;Wiener filters;affine transforms;convolution;correlation methods;image enhancement;image resolution;random processes","MRF;Markov random field;adaptive processing;affine transformation;convolution;image autocorrelation model;image resolution enhancement;optimal filter;spatially constrained Wiener filter","","0","","9","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After measuring the contrast and linewidth with the crossed-polarizer method, a comparison of the theoretical model and experimental data showed they were in good agreement.

GPS devices are notorious for their measurement errors vary from one point to the next. Therefore in order to improve the quality of the attitude estimates, the covariance matrix of measurement noise is estimated in real time upon information obtained from the differential GPS measurements, so that the KF filter continually is Â¿tunedÂ¿ as well as possible. No a priori knowledge on the direction cosines of the gravity vector in the inertial frame is required as these parameters can be also identified by the KF, relieving any need for calibration. Next, taking advantage of the redundant GPS measurements, a weight least-squares estimator is derived to weight the GPS measurement with the Â¿goodÂ¿ data more heavily than the one with Â¿poorÂ¿ data in the estimation process leading to a robust position estimation. Test results are presented showing the performance of the integrated IMU and two GPS to estimate the attitude and location of a mobile robot moving across uneven terrain.","","978-1-4244-3803-7","978-1-4244-3804-4","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354770","","Global Positioning System;Kinematics;Measurement units;Mobile robots;Noise measurement;Noise robustness;Position measurement;Real time systems;System testing;Weight measurement","Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;adaptive control;attitude control;estimation theory;inertial navigation;least squares approximations;matrix algebra;mobile robots;position control;real-time systems;three-dimensional displays;two-dimensional digital filters","3D attitude determination;Kalman filter adaptive variation;attitude determination;covariance matrix measurement noise;data estimation process;fusing data estimator based;global positioning systems;inertial measurement unit;least squares estimator;mobile robots localization;real time estimation;real time kinematic;robust position estimation","","0","","15","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MIKE interprets this domain with six soccer analysis modules that run concurrently within a role-sharing framework. We describe these analysis modules and also discuss how to control the interaction between them so that an explanation of a game emerges reactively from the system.

Data show that a large fraction of the radiation-induced increase in input bias current recovers after a 100°C anneal. The recovery in input bias current is linked to a significant amount of interface-trap annealing at 100°C. This is qualitatively consistent with previous data on interface-trap annealing and recent models for interface-trap annealing associated with hydrogen motion at the silicon/silcon dioxide interface. The annealing results have implications for hardness assurance testing. If the radiation induced charge that is responsible for ELDRS (whether it be interface or border traps) can anneal at 100°C, these data suggest that elevated temperature irradiations sometimes used to bound the ELDRS response of ICs may also cause some annealing of radiation-induced charge. These data help explain why high-dose-rate irradiations at elevated temperatures in some cases underestimate low-dose-rate degradation. In addition, these data confirm that high-dose-rate irradiations followed by elevated temperature anneals do not mimic the mechanisms that cause enhanced degradation at low dose rates in devices with ELDRS.","0018-9499","","","10.1109/TNS.2004.839200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369466","","Annealing;CMOS technology;Circuit testing;Degradation;Electronic equipment testing;Integrated circuit testing;Laboratories;Substrates;Temperature sensors;Thermal stresses","annealing;bipolar integrated circuits;dosimetry;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;interface states;passivation;radiation hardening (electronics);semiconductor device measurement;thermal stresses","100 C;LM139 comparators;Si-SiO<sub>2</sub>;annealing behavior;bipolar linear integrated circuits;defect annealing;elevated temperature irradiations;enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity;hardness assurance testing;high-dose-rate irradiations;hydrogen motion;input bias current;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;interface-trap annealing;linear bipolar devices;low-dose-rate degradation;passivation layers;postirradiation annealing behavior;preirradiation elevated temperature stress;radiation effects;radiation hardening (electronics);radiation induced charge;radiation response;silicon-silicon dioxide interface;thermal cycling;thermal stress effects;total dose degradation","","28","","28","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The model also applies to the mixed situation where a slender air terminal is installed on the top of a building to provide lightning protection. The basic elements of the model comprise a general criterion for continuous upward leader inception the validity of which is independent of the building or structure topology. This is followed by initiation of an upward leader trajectory which would either lead to a successful encounter with the negative downward leader through a final jump or to an aborted positive leader. Based on recent work published by the author, the model does not require any assumption regarding the ratio between the negative and positive leader speeds as has often been done previously. The modeling procedure has been facilitated through the use of dimensionless variables relating to the proximity effect of the building on space potential distribution, leader inception space potential, critical mean ambient ground field, and, finally, the attractive radius.

In order to build the fuzzy troubleshooting system, the linguistic data was gathered by interviewing palm oil refining plant workers that included experienced plant operators, supervisors and executives. Numerical data were collected by reviewing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Process and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), plant manual, etc. Root cause of deodorizer failure was separated into seven categories: Fatty Acid Distillate (FAD), cooling tower, hotwell, sparging steam, High Pressure Boiler (HPB), other vacuum parameter and others.

Eng., Air Force Inst. of Technol., Wright-Patterson AFB, OH","Aerospace conference, 2009 IEEE","20090424","2009","","","1","13","Autonomous aerial refueling requires a high level of accuracy and integrity. A great deal of research has been conducted in this problem area and has successfully demonstrated techniques with sufficient accuracy for fully autonomous refueling. Unfortunately, significantly less research has focused on the integrity of the relative navigation solution, especially in the presence of degraded sensor operation. In this paper, we present an image-based relative navigation algorithm which uses a predictive rendering technique to determine the relative pose of a lead aircraft using a monocular imaging camera. The predictive rendering algorithm is developed using image processing techniques and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated from an observability perspective using flight test data. Three variations of the algorithm are analyzed: sum squared difference, magnitude of gradient, and gradient with threshold. The observability of translation and rotation errors is discussed for all three techniques, noting any significant issues for each approach. Overall, the predictive rendering algorithm is shown to provide an accurate estimate of the relative position and attitude to a lead aircraft using a monocular camera. In addition, the algorithm can be tuned to provide a measurement that emphasizes precision versus convergence stability based on the mission requirements.","","978-1-4244-2621-8","978-1-4244-2622-5","10.1109/AERO.2009.4839600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839600","","Aircraft navigation;Algorithm design and analysis;Cameras;Convergence;Degradation;Image processing;Observability;Prediction algorithms;Rendering (computer graphics);Testing","aircraft;attitude control;convergence;gradient methods;image processing;rendering (computer graphics);stability","attitude;autonomous aerial refueling;convergence stability;flight test data;gradient magnitude;gradient with threshold;image processing;image-based relative navigation;lead aircraft;mission requirement;monocular imaging camera;position estimation;predictive rendering;relative pose;rotation error;sum squared difference;translation error","","0","","9","","","7-14 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional multiple reference frames single current macroblock (MRSC) scheme only considers the data reuse within one frame, and requires on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth in proportional to the reference frame number. In this paper, a single reference frame multiple current macroblocks (SRMC) scheme is presented to further exploit the data reuse at frame level. With frame-level rescheduling of the motion estimation ME procedures in different reference frames, one loaded search window can be utilized by multiple current MBs in different original frames. The demanded on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth for MRF-ME can thus be reduced to those supporting only one reference frame. Moreover, based on SRMC scheme, an architecture prototype with two-stage mode decision flow is proposed.

HTS cable terminations must span a temperature range from 77 to 300°K. The termination is insulated with insulating oil or air, cryogenic gaseous nitrogen, and liquid nitrogen. Difficult conditions for high-voltage insulation had to be overcome with HTS cable. Different environments can substantially raise the flashover possibility at a HTS cable termination.

To achieve high efficiency, the diode in conventional boost converter is replaced by MOSFET to use the converter with synchronous method. When using the synchronous boost converter with MOSFET which is a bi-directional device, in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), reverse current occurs because the secondary battery voltage is higher than the fuel cell voltage. Due to the long start-up time of the fuel cell, soft start method is required at the beginning where the reverse current can occur. Also, when charging the battery with constant current and constant voltage (CC/CV) charge method, DCM operation appears during CV mode. CCM and DCM are distinguished by the proposed mode boundary detector and the synchronous boost converter is controlled according to the determined mode. In DCM, the conventional boost converter with the diode is used, and the synchronous boost converter is used in CCM to prevent reverse current.","","","","10.1109/ICIT.2014.6894869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894869","battery charger;continuous conduction mode(CCM);discontinuous conduction mode(DCM);fuel cell;mode boundary detector;reverse current;synchronous boost converter","Conferences","MOSFET;electric current control;fuel cells;power convertors","DCM;MOSFET;bidirectional device;discontinuous conduction mode;fuel cell;hybrid system;mode boundary detector;reverse current control method;secondary battery voltage;soft start method;synchronous boost converter","","0","","","","","Feb. 26 2014-March 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the performance of the proposed scheme under various traffic arrival rates and distributions is evaluated.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4025077","","Admission control;Mobile ad hoc networks;Next generation networking;Paper technology;Quality of service;Scalability;Scheduling;Web and internet services;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","","","","0","","7","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic principle of the developed flexible force sensor array was based on the strong piezoelectrical property of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) in the sensor. The high mechanical strength and low-cost MLCCs make it ideal for large forces measuring applications. Measured results indicate that single MLCC force sensor can afford a large force loading of up to 1.1 GPa for a sensor with the cross section area of 0.64 mm<sup>2</sup>. Experimental results also indicate that the uses of MLCCs as the force sensors have several advantages including high force sensitivity, nice repeatability, high strength, big measuring range and small hysteresis behavior. A 3 times 3 MLCC force sensor array fabricated in a polyimide-based flexible circuit film (FCCL) is used to measure the corresponding force distribution in a simulated horse teeth mold fabricated with a rapid-prototyping process. The measured results indicate the MLCC force sensor array has a potential to be an ideal component for bite force measurement.","","978-1-4244-4190-7","978-1-4244-4193-8","10.1109/SENSOR.2009.5285593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5285593","bite force;flexible force sensor;multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC);piezoelectric","Area measurement;Capacitive sensors;Capacitors;Ceramics;Force measurement;Force sensors;Mechanical sensors;Mechanical variables measurement;Nonhomogeneous media;Sensor arrays","force measurement;force sensors;sensor arrays","MLCC force sensor array;flexible force sensor array;low-cost multilayer ceramic capacitors;occlusive bite force measurement;piezoelectrical property;polyimide-based flexible circuit film;rapid-prototyping process","","1","","10","","","21-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Topological navigation consists of topological mapping and obstacle avoidance navigation. In this environment, it has two major problems which are 1) identifying nodes under globally similar but locally slightly different shape of corridor environment for topological mapping and 2) obstacle avoidance navigation using cheap sensors. In order to detect nodes robustly, we define the eigenvalue ratio (EVR) which converts geometrical shape of the environment to a quantitative value based on the principal component analysis (PCA). This method is demonstrated by simulation and experiments to be robust, with the notable detail that at a given corridor intersection the method can detect a cluster of nodes defined in this manner. For safe obstacle avoidance navigation, we introduce circle following (CF) algorithm which uses geometry of environment and characteristics of sonar sensors.

In such scenarios, affordable techniques for error correction usually imply a timing penalty, e.g., check-pointing usually requires to repeat some part of the computation, which imposes a higher computation time. This can be problematic for real-time embedded control applications especially in the presence of intermittent hardware faults, for which delays due to re-computation are repeatedly encountered with high repetition rate. In this work, we investigate a setting where the control loops are executed on an unreliable embedded platform that may suffer from such intermittent faults. First, we characterize the impact of intermittent faults in the hardware by using an intermittent bit-flip fault model and RTL level error effect simulation. Subsequently, we look at novel fault-tolerant control algorithms that guarantee stability of the loops even in presence of repeating timing errors due to the error recovery of the unreliable hardware.","","","","10.1109/ISICIR.2014.7029568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029568","Fault modeling;fault-tolerant control law","Abstracts;Circuit faults;Control systems;Decision support systems;Indexes;Integrated circuit modeling","embedded systems;error correction;error detection;fault tolerant control;reliability","RTL level error effect simulation;architectural level;control loops;error correction;error detection recovery;fault-tolerant embedded control systems;intermittent bit-flip fault model;intermittent hardware faults;reliability techniques;repeating timing errors;software level;timing penalty;unreliable embedded platform;unreliable hardware","","0","","10","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, two performance criteria that mostly used in evaluating performance of the PID controller are employed to the proposed AVR system. By comparing the step responses of the two criteria, one of them is chosen as the best criterion for performance evaluation of the PID controller in non-linear conditions. Two optimization algorithms namely Shuffled Frog Leaping (SFL) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied for determining the optimal PID controller parameters in an AVR system with respect to minimizing the chosen criterion.

Eng., Univ. of Leeds, Leeds, UK","Lightwave Technology, Journal of","20120409","2012","30","12","1843","1856","In this paper, we propose a mobile optical wireless system that employs beam delay adaptation, and makes use of our previously introduced beam angle and power adaptation multi-beam spot diffusing configuration in conjunction with an imaging receiver. Our ultimate goal is to improve the bandwidth, reduce the effect of intersymbol-interference, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the transmitter operates at a higher data rate under the impact of multipath dispersion, background noise, and mobility. A significant reduction in the delay spread can be achieved compared to a conventional diffuse system (CDS) when an imaging receiver replaces a nonimaging receiver at the room's corner, where the delay spread is reduced from 2.4 ns to about 0.35 ns. Our proposed system, beam delay, angle, and power adaptation in a line strip multibeam spot diffusing configuration (BDAPA- LSMS), offers a reduction in delay spread by a factor of more than 10 compared with only the beam angle and power adaptation LSMS. An increase in channel bandwidth from 36 MHz (CDS) to about 9.8 GHz can be achieved when our methods of beam delay, angle, and power adaptation coupled with an imaging receiver are employed. These improvements enhance our system and enable it to operate at a higher data rate of 10 Gb/s. At a bit rate of 30 Mb/s, our proposed BDAPA-LSMS achieves about 50 dB SNR gain over conventional diffuse systems that employ a nonimaging receiver (CDS). Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed BDAPA-LSMS at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s achieves about 32.3 dB SNR at the worst communication path under the presence of background noise and mobility while achieving a bit error rate below 10<sup>-9</sup>.","0733-8724","","","10.1109/JLT.2012.2190970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179389","Angle and power adaptation;beam delay;gigabit mobile optical wireless systems;imaging receivers;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","Delay;Dispersion;Imaging;Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Signal to noise ratio","electromagnetic interference;error statistics;optical noise;optical receivers;optical transmitters","background noise;bandwidth 36 MHz;beam angle adaptation;beam delay;beam delay adaptation;bit error rate;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;bit rate 30 Mbit/s;conventional diffuse system;delay spread;imaging detection;imaging receiver;indoor optical wireless systems;intersymbol interference;line strip multibeam spot diffusing configuration;mobile optical wireless system;mobility;multibeam spot diffusing configuration;multipath dispersion;nonimaging receiver;power adaptation;signal-to-noise ratio;time 2.4 ns;transmitter","","4","","33","","","June15, 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A common preprocessing step designed for this purpose is to compute an over-segmentation of the image, often referred to as superpixels. In this paper, we propose a new approach to superpixels computation. In a first step, a hypergraph-based representation of the image is built. Then, a coarsening approach is operated on the resulting hypergraph to group pixels which belong to the same homogeneous region. This leads to a smaller hypergraph where each component represents a superpixel of the image. Our approach is very fast and can deal with great sized images. Its reliability have been tested on several real images from nature scenes with comparison to other methods. We show in particular that hypergraphs offer a more accurate image representation than graphs.","","978-1-4244-5996-4","","10.1109/ISVC.2010.5654894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654894","Hypergraph coarsening;Image segmentation;Superpixels algorithm","Clustering algorithms;Computer vision;Databases;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Partitioning algorithms;Pixel","graph theory;image representation;image segmentation","hypergraph coarsening;hypergraph-based representation;image representation;image segmentation;image superpixelization","","0","","16","","","Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize (w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up to a <i>O</i>(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>t</sub>) term, where <i>t</i> is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the average mutual information.","0018-9448","","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2162190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006593","Ergodic capacity;frequency selective MIMO channels;large random matrices","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Context;Covariance matrix;Electromagnetic interference;MIMO;Mutual information","Gaussian processes;MIMO communication;Rayleigh channels;approximation theory;channel capacity;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;frequency selective surfaces;optimisation;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","Gaussian large random matrices method;Rayleigh MIMO channel;asymptotic approximation;average mutual information approximation;capacity achieving covariance matrix;channel capacity;direct maximization approach;frequency selective MIMO channels;iterative waterfilling scheme;optimization algorithm;receive antenna;transmit antenna","","8","","18","","","Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Through a bibliographical study and a modeling approach of the interruption arc, an analysis of the role of the different mechanisms of energy transfer between the arc and SF/sub 6/ was conducted. With a 10 kA pulse, about 80% of the transfer is found to be due to convection and the rest to radiation from the arc. This transfer results in an overpressure of nearly 1 bar in SF/sub 6/ and 2 bar in N/sub 2/. It appears that the operation of this type of circuit breaker is limited to high currents: for currents below 7 kA the overpressure is lower than 0.5 bar, which does not provide efficient blowing at current zero.<<ETX>>","0093-3813","","","10.1109/27.16548","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=16548","","Circuit breakers;Current measurement;Electric variables measurement;Energy exchange;Energy measurement;Equations;Physics;Pistons;Temperature;Voltage","circuit-breaking arcs","0 to 2 bar;10 KA;N/sub 2/;SF/sub 6/;arc voltage;blowing;circuit-breaker arc;convection;current;electric field;energy transfer;high-current phase;interruption arc;overpressure;pressure rise;pressure variations;self-generated flow","","5","","21","","","Dec. 1988","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This DSC problem can be viewed as a generalization of the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem with only one remote source; it is also an extension of Oohama's latest work with correlated Gaussian remote sources, where the number of remote sources equals the number of observations. For our new DSC problem, we first provide general inner and outer rate regions, followed by a tighter outer rate region when the transform matrix between the sources and the encoders is semi-orthogonal. We then give a sufficient condition - in the form of capping the target distortion under certain threshold - for our inner and outer rate regions to match. When K = 1, both our inner and outer regions specialize to known result for the Gaussian CEO problem; with K = L and identity transform, our inner and outer regions degenerate to those provided by Oohama, however, our sufficient condition is more relaxed in the sense of allowing more matching cases.","","978-1-4244-6372-5","","10.1109/ITWKSPS.2010.5503203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5503203","","Decoding;Distortion measurement;Distributed computing;Gaussian noise;Robustness;Source coding;Sufficient conditions;Upper bound","Gaussian processes;decoding;source coding","DSC problem;K correlated remote Gaussian sources;L encoders;Oohama;correlated Gaussian remote sources;decoder;distributed source coding;noisy linear combinations;quadratic Gaussian CEO problem;remote sources subject;sum-distortion constraint;transform matrix","","2","","15","","","6-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of LiDAR data and WorldView-2 satellite imagery produced different combinations of input data layers for image segmentations and a large number of variables derived from these data layers for object-based classifications. Assessment of different features (including the input data layers and subsequently derived variables) for object-based forest classification is important. In this study, five image segmentation schemes were explored to test the effectiveness of the different input data layers, in particular, the new WorldView-2 multispectral bands to object-based forest classification. Object-based variables derived from these data layers were assessed to rank their importance before inputting into decision trees for forest classifications. It demonstrated that, using methods developed in this study, the integration of airborne LiDAR and eight WorldView-2 bands can significantly improve the accuracy of forest classification in our study area. The variable importance was ranked, indicating how important a variable contributes to the classification in a particular decision tree. The results showed that using LiDAR data alone or four conventional bands only, the overall accuracies achieved were 61.39% and 61.42% respectively, but the overall accuracy increased to 82.35% when all eight bands and the LiDAR data were used.","","978-1-4799-5757-6","","10.1109/EORSA.2014.6927920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927920","LiDAR;WorldView-2;decision tree;forest classification;object-based image analysis","Atmospheric modeling;Earth;Image resolution;Image segmentation;Laser radar;Object recognition;Remote sensing","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;image segmentation;remote sensing by laser beam;vegetation","LiDAR data;WorldView-2 band;WorldView-2 multispectral bands;WorldView-2 satellite imagery;airborne LiDAR band;airborne LiDAR data;feature assessment;forest structure modelling;high spatial resolution satellite imagery;image segmentations;input data layers;object-based forest classification;tree species classification;tree species identification","","0","","29","","","11-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can cause the insulation of a high voltage equipment to fail and lead to catastrophic incident. In a power transformer, detection of PD using acoustic emission technique has been gaining popularity due to its nonintrusive application and capability of locating PD sources. In this research work, acoustic emission (AE) detection system is used to detect PD in an experimental tank filled with transformer oil. Three different types of PD sources to generate PD in the experimental tank are created from pressboards which are the plain pressboard, the floating metal in the pressboard and the bubble in pressboard. Several samples of AE signals due to the occurrence of PD from the same discharge source are captured and recorded. In order to characterize the different types of PD sources, five features or descriptors were extracted from the Short-Time Fourier Transform spectrogram of the AE signals. Then, the preprocessing of the AE signals are carried out from the extracted features using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Neural Network. Finally, the characteristics of the AE signals from the acquired samples can be obtained and the outlier samples can be determined.","","978-1-4244-8947-3","","10.1109/PECON.2010.5697552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5697552","Acoustic Emission Sensors;Acoustic Emission Signals;Oil-pressboard Insulation;Partial Discharge Sources;Self-Organizing Map","","Fourier transform spectra;acoustic emission;acoustic signal detection;acoustic signal processing;feature extraction;partial discharges;power engineering computing;power transformer insulation;self-organising feature maps;transformer oil","AE signals;PD detection;SOM Neural Network;acoustic emission detection system;acoustic emission signal preprocessing;acoustic emission technique;discharge source;experimental tank;feature extraction;floating metal;high voltage electrical system;high voltage equipment insulation;oil-pressboard insulation system;partial discharge;power transformer;self-organizing map neural network;short-time Fourier transform spectrogram;transformer oil","","0","","11","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory of photonic band-gap (PBG) or electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) was developed initially for optical frequencies and can easily be applied to millimeters waves, microwaves and antenna. The PBG or EBG lattice can usually offer more flexibility to design the transmission line. Generally, EBG can diminish the propagation constant causing the wave to move slowly. In the relative researches, we have found that the EBG lattice can offer more flexibility to design the transmission line. The inductance and capacitance values of EBG can be adjusted by varying the dimensions of EBG lattice geometries, thus can effectively cancel the reactive part of the antenna impedance. If the spacing between CPW center conductor and ground remains the same, the optimization variables can be further reduced. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the spiral EBG into the antenna design and attempt to achieve better antenna performances.","","0-7803-9128-4","","10.1109/MAPE.2005.1617842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617842","","Antenna feeds;Antennas and propagation;Electromagnetic propagation;Lattices;Metamaterials;Microwave photonics;Optical materials;Periodic structures;Slot antennas;Transmission line theory","antenna feeds;coplanar waveguides;geometry;photonic band gap;slot antennas;transmission lines","conductor;electromagnetic band-gap;lattice geometries;millimeters waves;optical frequencies;optical wave propagation;photonic band-gap;photonics materials;relative theory;transmission line;triple-band slot antenna","","2","","3","","","8-12 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional approaches based on principal component analysis or position-patch suffers from the artifacts, low sharpness, and significant quality degradation for dis-aligned input images. In this paper, a novel face hallucination approach called eigen-patch is proposed. It combines eigen transformation with the concept of position-patch to increase local details while maintaining computation efficiency. Moreover, an image alignment procedure is proposed to align the input image to the database with multiple hypothesis verification. In addition, a re-projection procedure is also proposed to maintain the fidelity of the whole system. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the resolution of the input facial image faithfully, and it is more robust to dis-alignment between the input image and database.","","","","10.1109/ICME.2014.6890206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890206","Eigen Transformation;Eigen-Patch;Face Hallucination;PositionPatch;Principal Component Analysis","Databases;Face;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;PSNR;Principal component analysis;Training","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;face recognition;image resolution;principal component analysis;video surveillance","eigen transformation;eigen-patch;face hallucination;facial image resolution;multiple hypothesis verification;position-patch;principal component analysis;reprojection procedure;video surveillance","","0","","","","","14-18 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a ranking of five selected causes linked to road accidents. Types of vehicles involved in road accidents are considered as the criteria for ranking. The imprecision or vagueness inherited the causes has led the application of fuzzy sets theory to deal with ranking problems. Data in form of linguistic variables were collected from three authorized personnel of three Malaysian Government agencies. The multi criteria decision making, fuzzy TOPSIS was applied in computational procedures. From the analysis, it shows that registered vehicle was first in ranking and road environment as the last in ranking. The ranking is drawn using the magnitude of closeness coefficient of TOPSIS.

Pulsed-point source lights (LEDs) with limited visibility in range and angle are used as surrogate viewable events. A camera yaw estimate, with an error of +/-5 degrees, can be achieved with a single event observation. Using multiple observations weighted by their expected accuracy further reduces this error. The effects of camera occlusions caused by 3-D terrain elements are also examined. When more than two cameras observe an event, or when multiple events are visible from the same camera, it is possible to perform a secondary pass. Finally, given an occlusion map, the orientation of cameras that do not observe any events may be estimated by excluding pointing angles, at which events would otherwise be visible. Our results explore the dependencies of the system accuracy on factors such as: camera density, visibility range, occlusion rate, LED emission angles, cameras FOV, and GPS accuracies. For each system setup we calculate a 3-D coverage map as an end product.","","978-1-4799-3963-3","","10.1109/THS.2013.6699015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699015","area coverage;distributed sensors;pose estimation;sensor network calibration","Accuracy;Cameras;Estimation;Global Positioning System;Light emitting diodes;Measurement uncertainty;Sensors","distributed sensors;measurement errors;pose estimation;video cameras","3D terrain elements;GPS;LED emission angles;camera density;camera field coverage estimation;camera occlusions;camera pose;camera yaw estimate;cameras FOV;common event sensing;occlusion map;occlusion rate;pulsed point source lights;single event observation;visibility range","","0","","6","","","12-14 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Head-mounted display (HMD) is a key building block of wearable devices, and offers users immediate access to relevant information in a glance. However, most existing user input mechanisms accompanying HMDs are designed for interactive information exploration rather than for extended text entry. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a text input system for HMDs called Air Typing, which requires only a standard camera and is shown to be comparable in effectiveness to single-hand text input on tablet computers in a lab setting. Air Typing features a novel two-level virtual keyword layout, which substantially improves the typing speed by cutting down unnecessary hand movements during typing and greatly simplifies the associated image processing task by doing away with fine-grained matching between fingertips and keys. The current Air Typing prototype incorporates an OpenCV-based virtual key press detection algorithm that runs on the featured two-level virtual keyboard. In our tests, an experienced user's typing speeds of one-hand text input and of two-hand text input under Air Typing are 13 and 15 words per minute (WPM), respectively.","","","","10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097812","Head mounted display;fingertip detection and tracking;hand tracking;keyboard layout;typing in air;virtual keyboard","Engines;Keyboards;Layout;Presses;Skin;Thumb","cameras;feature extraction;gesture recognition;helmet mounted displays;image matching;keyboards;mobile handsets;notebook computers","HMD;OpenCV-based virtual key press detection algorithm;air typing prototype;extended text entry;featured two-level virtual keyboard;fine-grained matching;head mounted display-based wearable devices;image processing task;interactive information exploration;mobile device;mobile systems;one-hand text input;single-hand text input system;tablet computers;two-hand text input;two-level virtual keyword layout;user typing speeds","","0","","","","","16-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach uses techniques from stochastic processes and in particular, a construction related to the Brownian bridge.

These two integral equations are applied to reconstruction of the roughness profile of complex fractal surface. The fractal rough surfaces described by the band-limited Weistrass-Manderbrot function are numerically realized by using the Monte Carlo method. As the scattered fields along a line parallel to the mean surface are solved with the Gaussian beam incidence, the rough surface profile are then progressively inverted.

Early detection of shadow fading plays an important part in facilitating the design of adaptive data transmission schemes. We propose an accurate, on-line detection mechanism to detect a receiver entering or leaving shadow regions using simply signal strength measurements. The method is based on wavelet decomposition of signal strength time series into independent fading components. Our measurements indicate that fast fading signals have a scale invariant nature. This scale invariance of fading signals is destroyed when shadow fading, which is log-normal distributed and is independent of fast fading components, is added to the signal. An online detection mechanism is then proposed which exploits this phenomenon. Real measurements of signal strength traces are used to validate the detection mechanism.","","978-1-4244-1042-2","978-1-4244-1043-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410974","","Channel estimation;Data communication;Degradation;Fading;Legged locomotion;Protocols;Shadow mapping;Signal analysis;Wavelet coefficients;Wireless networks","fading channels;normal distribution;radio networks;time series;wavelet transforms","adaptive data transmission scheme;independent fading component;log-normal distribution;scale invariance;shadow fading detection;signal strength time series;wavelet decomposition;wireless communication;wireless network","","1","","9","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increased processing capabilities of graphic devices and recent improvements in CCD technology have made hexagonal sampling attractive for practical applications and brought new interests on this topic. The hexagonal structure is considered to be preferable to the rectangular structure due to its higher sampling efficiency, consistent connectivity and higher angular resolution and is even proved to be superior to square structure in many applications. Since there is no mature hardware for hexagonal-based image capture and display, square to hexagonal image conversion has to be done before hexagonal-based image processing. Although hexagonal image representation and storage has not yet come to a standard, experiments based on existing hexagonal coordinate systems have never ceased. In this paper, we firstly introduced general reasons that hexagonally sampled images are chosen for research.

Despite considerable research, high efficiency silicon based cells remain expensive, while the more recent organic photovoltaics are still struggling with low efficiencies and short lifetimes. Meanwhile, over the last few years, the study of localized plasmons has also received great attention due to the high field enhancements associated with confined fields, with a wide range of applications possible, from optical switches to substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Here we discuss how combining the structures normally used in photovoltaic devices with metallic cavities supporting localized plasmons can lead to considerable improvements in the performance of solar cells. In particular we show how by changing the shape and size of spherical voids on a metallic surface, one can tune the plasmon modes to obtain significant absorptions across the solar spectrum. By coating one such nanocavity surface with a sub 100 nm-layer of semiconductor, we can create a nanostructured solar cell, where the localised Mie modes efficiently couple light into the semiconductor layer. As the plasmons electric field enhancement is largest very close to the surface, significant absorption can be maintained even when the semiconductor thickness is reduced to below the typical exciton diffusion length.

Proceedings., Tenth Annual IEEE Symposium on","20020806","1995","","","148","155","One formulation of the concept of logic programming is the notion of an abstract logic programming language. Central to its definition is a uniform proof, which enforces the requirements of inference direction, including goal-directedness, and the duality of readings, both declarative and procedural. We use this technology to investigate disjunctive logic programming (DLP), an extension of traditional logic programming that permits disjunctive program clauses. This extension has been considered by some to be inappropriately identified with logic programming because the indefinite reasoning introduced by disjunction violates the goal-oriented search directionality that is central to logic programming. We overcome this criticism by showing that the requirement of uniform provability can be realized in a logic which is more general than that of DLP under a modest, sound modification of programs. We use this observation to derive inference rules that capture the essential proof structure of InH-Prolog (Inheritance Near-Horn Prolog), a known proof procedure for DLP","1043-6871","0-8186-7050-9","","10.1109/LICS.1995.523252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=523252","","Books;Calculus;Computer science;Databases;Logic programming","duality (mathematics);formal languages;inference mechanisms;logic programming;logic programming languages;programming theory;search problems;theorem proving","InH-Prolog;Inheritance Near-Horn Prolog;abstract logic programming language;declarative programming;disjunctive logic programming;disjunctive program clauses;duality of readings;goal-directedness;goal-oriented search directionality;indefinite reasoning;inference direction;inference rules;procedural programming;proof structure;sound program modification;uniform proofs;uniform provability","","1","","14","","","26-29 Jun 1995","26 Jun 1995-29 Jun 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the growing penetration rate of wind power, the susceptibility of the power system to power fluctuations increases. Wind turbines operating at a higher rotational speed compared to optimal tip speed ratio's have the ability to smooth power. However, the efficiency of a wind turbine with inertial power smoothing capabilities will be lower. Full inertial power smoothing for fluctuations of 0.01Hz and higher will decrease the overall wind turbines efficiency with less than 1.5%.","","978-1-4244-7667-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5649448","Fourier transformation;kinetic energy;power balancing;power smoothing;rotor inertia;speed control;torque set-point;wind power fluctuations","Fluctuations;Power smoothing;Power systems;Rotors;Torque;Wind power generation;Wind turbines","power generation control;smoothing methods;wind turbines","frequency 0.08 Hz to 0.5 Hz;inertial power smoothing;power system susceptibility;supplementary control;wind power fluctuations;wind power smoothing;wind turbine efficiency","","1","","26","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While depth maps-projections of 3D geometry onto 2D image planes at chosen camera viewpoints-can nowadays be readily captured by inexpensive depth sensors, they are often corrupted by non-negligible acquisition noise. Given depth maps need to be denoised and compressed at the encoder for efficient network transmission to the decoder, in this paper, we consider the denoising and compression problems jointly, arguing that doing so will result in a better overall performance than the alternative of solving the two problems separately in two stages. Specifically, we formulate a rate-constrained estimation problem, where given a set of observed noise-corrupted depth maps, the most probable (maximum a posteriori (MAP)) 3D surface is sought within a search space of surfaces with representation size no larger than a prespecified rate constraint. Our rate-constrained MAP solution reduces to the conventional unconstrained MAP 3D surface reconstruction solution if the rate constraint is loose. To solve our posed rate-constrained estimation problem, we propose an iterative algorithm, where in each iteration the structure (object boundaries) and the texture (surfaces within the object boundaries) of the depth maps are optimized alternately. Using the MVC codec for compression of multiview depth video and MPEG free viewpoint video sequences as input, experimental results show that rate-constrained estimated 3D surfaces computed by our algorithm can reduce coding rate of depth maps by up to 32% compared with unconstrained estimated surfaces for the same quality of synthesized virtual views at the decoder.","1057-7149","","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2326413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819840","Multiview video;depth image compression;image denoising","Cameras;Estimation;Image coding;Noise;Surface reconstruction;Surface treatment;Three-dimensional displays","data compression;estimation theory;image denoising;iterative methods;rendering (computer graphics);video codecs;video coding","3D surface reconstruction;MVC codec;acquisition noise;depth image based rendering;depth maps;iterative algorithm;maximum a posteriori;network transmission;noise corrupted multiview depth videos;rate constrained 3D surface estimation;video sequences;virtual images","","1","","33","","2014-05-22","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, field reliability experienced by customers often does not match those expectations. Actual disk drive reliability may differ greatly from the manufacturer's specification and from customer to customer because of dependence on a variety of factors, some of which are completely independent of the drive design or manufacturing process. Thermal environment and duty cycle, inherent characteristics of the drive itself, architecture and logic of the system in which it is used, and the data collection and analysis process itself are all sources of significant variability. Together, these can create a range on mean time between failures (MTBF), if MTBF is indeed the correct metric, of 350,000 to 1,200,000 hours over the lifetime of a population of server class disk drives. This paper further elaborates on these four causes of variability and explains how each is responsible for a possible gap between expected and measured drive reliability.","","0-7803-8215-3","","10.1109/RAMS.2004.1285439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285439","","Data analysis;Databases;Disk drives;Electronic equipment testing;Home appliances;Life estimation;Life testing;Manufacturing processes;Network servers;System testing","Weibull distribution;customer satisfaction;disc drives;manufacturing processes;reliability","Weibull distribution;data collection;drive reliability;duty cycle;field data;hard disk drive manufacturers;manufacturing process;mean time between failures;returns database;server class disk drives;system architecture;system logic;thermal environment","","6","1","","","","26-29 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This simulation ideally made in a single development environment, should cover different areas and all components of the system. In this paper, we briefly describe the behavioral models of the elements of a large scale wireless sensors network (WSN) used to create our simulator, focusing specifically on the model of the transmission channel, and how we can retrieve results from the behavioral simulator.

The design and control of quadruped robots has become a fascinating research field because they have better mobility on unstructured terrains. Until now, many kinds of quadruped robots were developed, such as JROB-1 [1], BISAM [2], BigDog [3], LittleDog [4], HyQ [5] and Cheetah cub [6]. They have shown significant walking performance. However, most of them use serial mechanism legs and have animal like structure: the thigh and the crus. To swing the crus in swing phase and support the body's weight in stance phase, a linear actuator is attached on the thigh [2, 3, 5, 6], or instead, a rotational actuator is installed on the knee joint [1, 4]. To make the robot more useful in the wild environment, e.g., the detection or manipulation tasks, the payload capability is very important. To carry the sensors or tools, heavy load legged robot is very necessary. Thus the knee actuator should be lightweight, powerful and easy to maintain. However, this can be very costly and hard to satisfy at the same time.","","","","10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907223","","Actuators;Automation;Legged locomotion;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems","actuators;gait analysis;legged locomotion","knee actuator;linear actuator;parallel mechanism legs;quadruped robot;walking performance","","0","","","","","May 31 2014-June 7 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The delay that occurs during the break-off interval can vary from a few hundreds of microseconds to a few seconds. However, delay sensitive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or streaming multimedia applications usually are unable to tolerate such long connectivity delays that fall beyond the range of 50-200 ms. This results in dropped calls or frozen video frames. To improve the deficiency, this paper proposes the preliminary study of managing the signal strength threshold to minimize handoff time by investigating the effect of changing the threshold at AP. Although different solutions are available in the literature, most of them proposed changes that were outside the purview of the current 802.11 standards. Our study requires no additional support from the network.

A bank of even and odd S-Gabor filter pairs of different orientations are convolved with vascular images in order to create an external snake energy field. Each fitter pair will give maximum response to the segment of vessel having the same orientation as the filters. The resulting responses across filters of different orientations are combined to create an external energy field for snake optimization. Vessels are represented by B-Spline snakes, and are optimized on filter outputs with dynamic programming. The points of minimal constriction and the percent-diameter stenosis are determined from a computed vessel centerline. The system has been statistically validated using fixed stenosis and flexible-tube phantoms. It has also been validated on 20 coronary lesions with two independent operators, and has been tested for interoperator and intraoperator variability and reproducibility.

It is based on fast numerical inversion of the cumulative distribution functions and exploits the strong correlation between the increments of the original process and Brownian motion. In the suggested control variate framework, a similar functional of Brownian motion is used as a main control variate while some other characteristics of the paths are used as auxiliary control variates.

Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Symposium on","20020806","1998","","","191","","A new method for reducing peak to average power ratio (PAR) in multicarrier systems is presented. The PAR is reduced by adding time domain signals to the data sequence that lay in a disjoint frequency space to the multicarrier data symbols. With this formulation, optimizing the time domain signal leads to a convex optimization problem that can be transformed into a linear program (LP). Solving the LP exactly leads to PAR reductions of 6-10 dB, but a simple gradient algorithm could achieve most of this reduction after a few iterations. These additive signals can be easily removed from the received signal without transmitter-receiver symbol handshake","","0-7803-5000-6","","10.1109/ISIT.1998.708789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=708789","","Baseband;Degradation;Digital video broadcasting;Gaussian processes;Information systems;Laboratories;OFDM modulation;Peak to average power ratio;Time domain analysis;Transmitters","convex programming;gradient methods;linear programming;modulation;optimisation;time-domain analysis","additive signals;convex optimization problem;data sequence;disjoint frequency space;efficient algorithms;iterations;linear program;multicarrier data symbols;multicarrier modulation;multicarrier systems;peak to average power ratio;reducing PAR;simple gradient algorithm;time domain signals","","42","10","2","","","16-21 Aug 1998","16 Aug 1998-21 Aug 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The device presented here is capable of resolving changes in pressure as small as 200 mtorr within a PDMS channel. The embedded GMR grating has a pitch distance of 500 nm when the PDMS membrane is unstrained; at this pitch, the grating has a resonance response at around 727 nm, producing a peak in the reflectivity spectrum of the device. When pressure within the channel increases, the membrane is strained, resulting in an increase in the grating pitch as well as its corresponding resonant wavelength. By measuring the resulting change in the reflectivity spectrum of the grating, the device should be able to detect changes in relative pressure throughout a range of over 60 torr.","1057-7157","","","10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2203792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231639","Guided-mode resonance (GMR);microfluidics;optical diffraction;pressure measurement","Diffraction gratings;Finite element methods;Gratings;Magnetic resonance;Strain;Substrates","diffraction gratings;membranes;nanosensors;optical polymers;optical sensors;pressure sensors;titanium compounds","PDMS channel;PDMS membrane;TiO<sub>2</sub>;distance 500 nm;embedded GMR grating;high-resolution optical pressure sensor;one-dimensional nanograting-based guided-mode resonance pressure sensor;polydimethylsiloxane membrane;reflectivity spectrum;resonant wavelength;size 85 mum","","1","","22","","2012-07-03","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results show better performance and lower power consumption for MDCVSPG compared to EDCVSL and DCVSPG. In addition, when is used in design of an 8 bit ripple carry adder, the proposed style consumes 38% less silicon area compared to DCVSPG.

ESMO 2006.

Applied robotics has found several niche applications in Hydro-Quebec operations. One example of a recently developed robotic solution for power line applications is the LineROVer Technology. Now that the technology has proven its worth for power system applications, the next logical step in the project is to develop a vehicle capable of clearing such obstacles as insulator strings, vibration dampers, aircraft warning spheres and corona rings. It must also clear spacer dampers and insulator strings as it travels along conductor bundles. The LineScout robot developed meets this requirement and can clear obstacles as it travels down a line. It can move along several axes, allowing it to adjust its shape in real time to various line configurations and to a wide range of obstacles while remaining as light and compact as possible. The robot's geometry was engineered to give it at least six possible obstacle-clearing sequences, making it versatile in unforeseen situations. The robot can operate on an energized line, has one-day battery life and can be remotely controlled 5 km away. The control approach and electronics allow intuitive human operation of the robot. Moreover, it can operate semi-autonomously, learning to clear obstacles by means of automated sequences.

Sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible filters are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, upon which both the delay-independent and dependent filtering problems are cast into convex optimization problems. These two approaches also incorporate a new parameter-dependent stability result into the filter designs, which greatly reduces the conservatism of the quadratic framework.

SMRs resonating at frequencies around 1.75 GHz have been fabricated, some devices using a thin film of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the top electrode material and some identical devices using a chromium/gold electrode. Protein solutions with different concentrations were loaded on the top of the resonators and their responses to mass-load from physically adsorbed coatings were investigated. Results show that resonators using CNTs as the top electrode material exhibited higher frequency change for a given load due to the higher active surface area of a thin film of interconnecting CNTs compared to that of a metal thin film electrode and hence exhibited greater mass loading sensitivity. It is therefore concluded that the use of CNT electrodes on resonators for their use as gravimetric biosensors is viable and worthwhile.","1075-6787","978-1-61284-111-3","","10.1109/FCS.2011.5977728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977728","","Acoustics;Electrodes;Films;Metals;Resonant frequency;Sensors","III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;biosensors;bulk acoustic wave devices;carbon nanotubes;electrodes;gravimeters;thin film sensors;wide band gap semiconductors","AlN-C;CNT electrodes;SMR;biosensing application;carbon nanotube electrode;chromium-gold electrode;gravimetric sensing;mass loading sensitivity;metal thin film electrode;solid mounted resonators","","0","","26","","","2-5 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing.

For large scale, industrial applications of pulsed corona techniques it is important to develop systems having high energy conversion efficiency. From electrical engineering point of view the challenge is to optimize energy transfer from a power modulator to a reactor with a transient impedance. The matching is expressed as the energy transfer efficiency between the modulator and the reactor. For a matched svstem. a maximum amount of the available energy in the power modulator is used to generate the streamer plasma. The criterion for optimal matching between a modulator and a load is that the output impedance of the modulator is equal to the load impedance. When trying to match a plasma reactor to a pulsed power modulator this criterion is difficult to obey since the load impedance changes rapidlv before, during and after plasma generation. To simulate the response of the load as function of the voltage pulse, a simplified equivalent circuit is used. This circuit was used to analyze the matching between the modulator and the load. Measurements will be presented that support and extend the derived model. Based upon the findings, guidelines to optimize the matching between modulator and reactor are derived. By using the gathered information we already succeeded to construct a large average power (10-30 kW), high energy efficient (>90%) pulsed corona plasma system with short (~100 ns) pulses.","0730-9244","978-1-4244-0915-0","","10.1109/PPPS.2007.4345745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4345745","","Corona;Energy exchange;Impedance;Inductors;Large-scale systems;Plasma applications;Plasma measurements;Plasma simulation;Power generation;Pulse modulation","corona;discharges (electric);equivalent circuits;impedance matching;modulators;plasma production;pulsed power technology","corona plasma reactor;energy conversion efficiency;energy transfer efficiency;energy transfer optimization;equivalent circuit;load impedance;modulator output impedance;pulsed corona plasma system;pulsed power modulator;streamer plasma generation;transient impedance","","0","","","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the minimum angles of all triangles in the planar triangulation are maximized by means of edge switching to improve connectivity and throughput. The resulting triangulation at this stage, the Delaunay triangulation, can be determined locally at each node. The topology is modified by negotiating among neighbors to satisfy a design requirement on the nodal degree parameter.

In this service, however, unexpected service degradation may occur and differentiation among classes may be disordered if the network is designed to minimize over-provisioning or is under-provisioned. We therefore developed a packet scheduling scheme that dynamically allocates bandwidth to each class queue to guarantee the differentiation among classes under any traffic conditions. The scheme estimates the sum of CIRs (committed information rates), i.e. rate of the packets having lowest drop preference, of active flows in each class and initially allocates the link bandwidth according to the sum of CIRs. It allocates the excess bandwidth by using a combination of CIR-proportional allocation and equal-share allocation. The equal share part enables that the flows in best effort class or the flows having zero CIRs can utilize minimum share of the bandwidth. Our scheme also introduces a scalable scheduling technique to improve fairness among flows in the same class. We evaluate the proposed scheme and show that it makes DiffServ operations fairer under any traffic conditions.","","0-7803-7400-2","","10.1109/ICC.2002.997264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997264","","Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Degradation;Diffserv networks;Information rates;National electric code;Quality of service;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;bandwidth allocation;packet switching;quality of service;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","CIR-proportional allocation;DiffServ classes;IETF Differentiated Services working group;IP header;Internet;QoS;TCP/UDP;assured forwarding per hop behavior;best effort class;class-based differentiated IP services;committed information rates;dynamic fair bandwidth allocation;edge routers;equal-share allocation;flow aggregation level control;high-speed backbone routers;link bandwidth;packet drop preference;packet scheduling;quality of service;queue management;scalable scheduling;service degradation;traffic conditions","","10","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The computational complexities of the proposed fast 1-D 4 times 4 and 8 times 8 inverse integer transforms for H.264/AVC are the same as those of the previous fast methods.

The dataset was acquired from 36 stationary camera views using a variety of surveillance cameras with resolutions ranging from standard VGA to three megapixel. 27 cameras observed the persons and vehicles in an outdoor environment, while the remaining nine observed the same persons indoors. The activity of persons was planned in advance, they drive the cars to the parking lot, exit the cars and walk around the building, through the main entrance, and up the stairs, towards the first floor of the building. The intended use of the dataset is performance evaluation of computer vision methods that aim to (re)identify people and objects from many different viewpoints in different environments and under variable conditions. Due to variety of camera locations, vantage points and resolutions, the dataset provides means to adjust the difficulty of the identification task in a controlled and documented manner. An interface for easy use of dataset within Matlab is provided as well, and the data is complemented by baseline results using a basic color histogram-based descriptor.

In telecommunication, the importance of antenna array processing initiates from its ability to cancel the noise and interfering signals, mitigate the multipath and fading due to the environment effects, reduce the total power consumption, and its ability to replace the mechanical scanning arrays. The objective of this work is to improve the performance of adaptive array systems by taking the inter-element coupling effects into account. Many publications discussed the adaptive arrays techniques neglecting the coupling effects, but in practical antennas the elements of the array affect each other through mutual coupling and this reduces the adaptive antenna system performance. In the present work the adaptive array response is considered in two cases, beamforming and Direction of Arrival [DOA] estimation algorithms. To be able to compensate the coupling effects the coupling needs to be calculated. Here, the coupling in Uniform Linear Array (ULA) of MicroStrip (MS) patches is calculated using two Matlab codes and FEKO software based on MOM technique. This small array composed of three MS elements, is considered as a replacement of the single element mobile station antenna. The final numerical simulations for the proposed adaptive array system prove that including coupling effects greatly improve performance of the array.","","978-1-61284-805-1","","10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873591","Beamforming;Direction of Arrival Estimation;Microstrip Arrays;Mutual Coupling","Adaptive arrays;Arrays;Instruction sets","adaptive antenna arrays;array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;linear antenna arrays;method of moments;microstrip antenna arrays","DOA estimation algorithm;FEKO software;MOM technique;Matlab codes;ULA;antenna array processing;beamforming;direction-of-arrival estimation;interelement coupling effect;microstrip adaptive array;microstrip patches;mutual coupling effect;portable device;uniform linear array","","0","","13","","","26-28 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Space operations issues will be separated from the power generation fixation and verified by testing. Doing the developmental testing on the ground instead of in space will result in a low cost program that can be accomplished in a very short time. The concept is to build a Ground Test Installation that couples an existing 100 kW terrestrial solar cell array to a phased-array wireless power transmitter based on a subarray.

These ideas motivated the creation of the European Certimark project. After a short definition of dewatermarking, we present an original attack based on self similarities. This attack is then put to the test with three different publicly available watermarking tools.

In this paper, a discontinuous finite-element time-domain method (DGFETD) is introduced that utilizes hierarchical Nedelec curl-conforming mixed-order basis functions. Such basis naturally satisfy the divergence free-nature of the fields, and hence the formulation avoids the need for penalty methods [3]. It also allows for local hp-refinement of the discretization.

To increase sensitivity while maintaining spatial resolution, we designed and constructed a multi-pinhole collimator array to replace the parallel hole collimators of a Ceraspect human SPECT brain scanner. The Ceraspect scanner is composed of an annular NaI(Tl) crystal within which the eight pinhole collimators (1-mm-diameter holes) rotate while projecting nonoverlapping images of the object onto the stationary annular crystal. In this manner, only one-eighth of a collimator rotation is required to acquire a full circle orbit tomographic data set. The imaging field of view (FOV) has a diameter of 25.6 mm in the transverse direction, which is sufficient to encompass a mouse in the transverse direction. The axial FOV is 25.6 mm at the center of the FOV and 13.9 mm at the edge of the transverse FOV. Data are currently acquired in step-and-shoot mode; however, the system is capable of list mode acquisition with the collimator continuously rotating. Images are reconstructed using a cone-beam ordered subsets expectation maximization method. The reconstructed spatial resolution of the system is 1.7 mm and the sensitivity at the center of the FOV is 13.8 cps/microCi. A whole-body bone scan of a mouse injected with [Tc-99 m]MDP clearly revealed skeletal structures such as the ribs and vertebral bodies. These preliminary results suggest that this approach is a good tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity and, with further refinement, may permit dynamic imaging in living animals.","0278-0062","","","10.1109/TMI.2005.843782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461521","Micro SPECT;mouse imaging;pinhole SPECT","Animals;Cameras;Collimators;Computed tomography;High-resolution imaging;Humans;Image reconstruction;Mice;Optical imaging;Spatial resolution","brain;collimators;image reconstruction;image resolution;medical image processing;single photon emission computed tomography;solid scintillation detectors","1 mm;25.6 mm;Ceraspect human SPECT brain scanner;annular Nal(Tl) crystal;annular scintillation camera;cone-beam ordered subsets expectation maximization;dynamic imaging;high-resolution mouse SPECT;image reconstruction;list mode acquisition;living animals;multipinhole collimator array;reconstructed spatial resolution;ribs;single pinhole gamma cameras;skeletal structures;step-and-shoot mode;vertebral bodies","Animals;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Gamma Cameras;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Mice;Miniaturization;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","14","","12","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among the various algorithms for cluster ensembles, those based on coassociation matrices are probably the ones studied and used the most because coassociation matrices are easy to understand and implement. However, the main limitation of coassociation matrices as the data structure for combining multiple clusterings is the complexity that is at least quadratic to the number of patterns <i>N</i>. In this paper, we propose CA-tree, which is a dendogram-like hierarchical data structure, to facilitate efficient and scalable cluster ensembles for coassociation-matrix-based algorithms.

We then apply a threshold to the CA-tree to obtain a set of nodes, which are then used in place of the original patterns for ensemble-clustering algorithms.

These two problems are addressed here by a new type of leaky wave antenna, in which the fabrication problem is minimized by employing a longitudinally continuous aperture, and the higher loss reduced by basing the antenna on a low-loss waveguide, the groove guide. A longitudinally continuous asymmetric metal strip provides the mechanism that transforms the initially bound mode into a leaky mode. An accurate analysis, based on a transverse equivalent network, is presented here for the properties of this leaky structure that takes into account the mode conversion from the bound mode to the leaky mode. All the constituents of this transverse equivalent network are obtained in closed form, thus yielding a dispersion relation in closed form. Part I of these two companion papers describes the new antenna and its principle of operation, and then derives the parameters of the complete transverse equivalent network. Part II is concerned with the properties of the leaky mode and their relations to leaky wave antenna performance; design considerations together with a variety of numerical results are contained in Part II.","0018-926X","","","10.1109/TAP.1985.1143530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1143530","","Antenna theory;Aperture antennas;Attenuation;Dispersion;Feeds;Frequency;Leaky wave antennas;Optical device fabrication;Rectangular waveguides;Waveguide transitions","","Leaky-wave antennas;Millimeter-wave antennas;Waveguide antennas","","15","","17","","","Dec 1985","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, the observations are derived from GPS receivers onboard low Earth orbiting satellites. However, with the current number of satellites, it is difficult to provide dense sounding measurements in a specific region within a limited time period. With a GPS receiver onboard an airplane, the GPS RO technique offers such an opportunity while retaining the high vertical resolution sounding capability. The GNSS Instrument System for Multistatic and Occultation Sensing is currently under development for the National Science Foundation's High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) aircraft. This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of the airborne occultation technique that will be used for the HIAPER system. The results demonstrate an anticipated overall accuracy of better than 0.5% for the retrieved refractivity from the surface to about 1 km below the airplane, where the expected airplane velocity errors of up to 5 mm/s limit the accuracy. The effects on the retrievals due to horizontal variations in atmospheric refractivity are significant, and retrieval errors may reach several percent inside frontal systems when the front is perpendicular to the ray paths and within 200 km of the tangent point. In general, the airborne GPS RO system provides a promising new data source for NWP and targeted observational studies.","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685938","Airborne;Global Positioning System (GPS);aircraft;atmospheric measurements;microwave radio propagation;radio occultation (RO)","Airplanes;Atmosphere;Global Positioning System;Humidity;Instruments;Low earth orbit satellites;Refractive index;Satellite broadcasting;Temperature sensors;Weather forecasting","Global Positioning System;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric temperature;radiowave propagation;remote sensing","Earth orbiting satellites;GNSS Instrument System for Multistatic and Occultation Sensing;Global Navigation Satellite system;Global Positioning System;HIAPER aircraft;High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research;National Science Foundation;airborne GPS radio occultation technique:;atmospheric humidity profile;atmospheric refractivity;atmospheric temperature profile;numerical weather prediction models","","5","","47","","","Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and affinity propagation (AP), which belong to feature extraction and feature selection respectively, are combined together to accomplish the DR task. Firstly, DWT-based features are extracted from the original hyperspectral data; secondly, AP is applied to select representative features from the obtained ones. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with some other DR methods which only make use of feature extraction or feature selection, the features acquired by the hybrid technique make the classification results more accurate.","2153-6996","978-1-4244-9565-8","978-1-4244-9564-1","10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5652463","Hyperspectral imagery classification;affinity propagation;dimensionality reduction;discrete wavelet transform","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Discrete wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Noise","computational complexity;discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;image classification","affinity propagation;computation complexity;discrete wavelet transform;feature extraction;feature selection;hyperspectral image classification","","6","","11","","","25-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to overcome these problems, we have investigated the integrated micro-ECL detection system based on silicon photodiode, which is integrated with SAM (self-assembled monolayer)-coated electrochemical electrode and microfluidic channel. The interdigitated electrodes have been used to generate uniform electrical field on the electrochemical electrode. SAM-coated interdigitated electrodes was bonded the PDMS micro-channel fabricated by replica molding process. To analyze glucose concentration in micro-ECL system with microfluidic channel, we determined the optimum conditions of ECL electrode potential, luminol concentration and flow rate. After optimization of the working condition, a series of measurements were performed with artificial glucose concentrations range from 1 mM to 10 mM in the integrated micro-ECL system. The photocurrent was proportional to glucose concentration from 1 mM to 10 mM. Also, ECL reaction was evaluated by photodiode in micro system with 0.95 μl. Therefore, we confirmed possibility of integrated ECL detection system for glucose biosensor.","","0-7803-8711-2","","10.1109/MMB.2005.1548435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1548435","Electrochemiluminescence;Glucose biosensor;SAM;photodiode","Biochemical analysis;Biomedical optical imaging;Biosensors;Chemistry;Electrodes;Microfluidics;Optical devices;Optical sensors;Photodiodes;Sugar","biochemistry;biosensors;chemical variables measurement;chemiluminescence;electrochemical electrodes;electrochemical sensors;microfluidics;microsensors;monolayers;moulding;optical sensors;organic compounds;photodiodes;replica techniques;self-assembly;silicon","Si;glucose biosensor;glucose concentration;integrated micro-electrochemiluminescence detection system;interdigitated electrodes;luminol concentration;microfluidic channel;photocurrent;polydimethylsiloxane micro-channel fabrication;replica molding process;self-assembled monolayer-coated electrochemical electrode;silicon photodiode","","1","","5","","","12-15 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are interested in researching the impact that Facebook can have for online students in an introductory programming course. In particular we want to know whether any learning can occur in Facebook. A programming group was set up on Facebook for our cohort of fully online students who already have access to Blackboard, our University's learning management system, for them to discuss, chat and brainstorm about programming. We compare the student participation to the two environments: the Blackboard Discussion Forum and the Facebook programming group, over the semester of the course. In this paper we analyse the student postings and identify the similarities and differences of the two environments and we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each environment. Our primary finding was that Facebook attracted more students (over Blackboard) due to its social and community learning benefits, encouraging students to support one another. Blackboard was viewed as the authoritative and valid medium for official course material. Finally, there is a need for further work to determine how the two media may be better integrated for course delivery.","","978-1-4673-5627-5","978-0-7695-4960-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542243","Blackboard;Facebook;Learning Management System;Social networking sites","Education;Encoding;Facebook;Materials;Programming profession","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;programming;social networking (online)","Facebook programming group;blackboard discussion forum;computing education;course delivery;educational resources;fully online course;introductory programming course;official course material;online students;programming learning;university courses;university learning management system","","0","","23","","","21-24 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A reduction of space charge accumulation under DC stress has been shown. In this communication, we report on electrical properties using dielectric and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Dielectric spectroscopy has been used to characterize ionic conduction and to evaluate the effect of the filler concentration on the dielectric permittivity.

The three classes for classification considered in this study are normal, very mild AD and mild and moderate AD subjects. The machine learning algorithms used are: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification, with its performance optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Genetic algorithm (GA) used for feature selection. A Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used for feature extraction from the MRI images and GA is used to reduce the high dimensional features needed for classification. The GA-ELM-PSO classifier yields an average training accuracy of 94.57 % and a testing accuracy of 87.23 %, averaged across the three classes, over ten random trials. The results clearly indicate that the proposed approach can differentiate between very mild AD and normal cases more accurately, indicating its usefulness in detecting the onset of AD.","2326-991X","978-1-4673-5919-1","","10.1109/CIMI.2013.6583856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583856","Alzheimer's;Machine Learning;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Voxel-Based Morphometry","Accuracy;Diseases;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Testing;Training","biomedical MRI;diseases;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;particle swarm optimisation","Alzheimer disease detection;GA-ELM-PSO classifier;MRI image;VBM approach;extreme learning machine algorithm;feature extraction;feature selection;genetic algorithm;magnetic resonance imaging scan;particle swarm optimization;three-class classification problem;voxel-based morphometry","","0","","35","","","16-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The other issue is whether the currently available square designs can be generalized to a rectangular design and in particular, to a linear dispersion code design. This paper resolves these issues by proposing a trace-orthonormal linear space-time block code and linear dispersion code, and giving a systematic method to design such a code family.

Increased capacity is achieved by introducing additional spatial channels which are exploited using space-time coding. The spatial diversity improves the link reliability by reducing the adverse effects of link fading and shadowing. Because antenna arrays are used at both the transmitter and receiver, interference can be mitigated naturally. In this paper, MIMO communication is investigated using outdoor experimental data collected near the PCS frequency allocation (1790 MHz) in the presence of multiple jammers. Coherence issues associated with implementing antenna arrays using ad hoc groups of users are addressed. Presented here is an experimental example of demodulation of a space-time turbo code using a multichannel multiuser detector (MCMUD) that compensates for delay and Doppler spread, as well as local oscillator mismatch. In the experimental data the MIMO signal is transmitted from a moving vehicle.","","0-7803-8140-8","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290428","","Antenna arrays;Bandwidth;Fading;Interference;MIMO;Power system reliability;Receiving antennas;Robustness;Shadow mapping;Wireless communication","Doppler shift;MIMO systems;ad hoc networks;antenna arrays;delays;diversity reception;fading channels;frequency allocation;interference (signal);jamming;multiuser detection;radiocommunication;receiving antennas;space-time codes;telecommunication services;transmitting antennas;turbo codes","1790 MHz;Doppler spread;MIMO wireless communication;PCS frequency allocation;ad hoc antenna arrays;antenna receiver;antenna transmitter;data rate;delay;interference;link fading;local oscillator mismatch;multichannel multiuser detector;multiple jammers;multiple-input multiple-output systems;space-time turbo code;spatial channels;spatial diversity;system bandwidth","","5","3","","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Representation inheritance: a safe form of ""white box"" code inheritance","Edwards, S.H.","Dept. of Comput. & Inf. Sci., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","Software Reuse, 1996., Proceedings Fourth International Conference on","20020806","1996","","","195","204","There are two approaches to using code inheritance for defining new component implementations in terms of existing implementations. Black-box code inheritance allows subclasses to reuse superclass implementations as-is, without direct access to their internals. Alternatively, white-box code inheritance allows subclasses to have direct access to superclass implementation details, which may be necessary for the efficiency of some subclass operations. Unfortunately, white-box code inheritance violates the protection that encapsulation affords to superclasses, opening up the possibility of a subclass interfering with the correct operation of its superclass methods. Representation inheritance is proposed as a restricted form of white-box code inheritance where subclasses have direct access to superclass implementation details, but are required to respect the representation invariant(s) and abstraction relation(s) of their ancestor(s). This preserves the protection that encapsulation provides, while allowing the freedom of access that component implementers sometimes desire.","","0-8186-7301-X","","10.1109/ICSR.1996.496127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=496127","","Encapsulation;Functional programming;Information science;Object oriented modeling;Object oriented programming;Protection;Safety","data encapsulation;inheritance;object-oriented programming;software reusability","abstraction function;abstraction relation;abstraction relations;access;ancestors;behavioral subtype;component implementations;encapsulation;model-based specification;object-oriented software;representation inheritance;representation invariants;safety;specialization;subclass operations;superclass implementations reuse;superclass protection;white-box code inheritance","","1","","18","","","23-26 April 1996","23 Apr 1996-26 Apr 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 2002 Symposia on","20021210","2002","","","90","92","Designs of complex objects often include parameters which, when given values, provide a realisation of a specific example of the design. Such parametrised designs, therefore, actually represent families of objects. In order to provide the programming capabilities necessary for building such parametrised designs, some computer-aided design systems include programming languages or provide interfaces to them. This creates a sharp division in the design process between designer and programmer. To address this discontinuity, a Language for Structured Design (LSD) has been proposed as an extension to a visual logic programming language. In LSD, design components and operations on them are homogeneously represented in one language. Here we report on another advantage of the LSD approach; namely, that visual logic programming, used as the engine to drive the parametrised assembly of objects, also provides powerful symbolic problem-solving capability. This allows the designer/programmer to work at a higher level, giving descriptive rather than prescriptive specifications of a design. Hence LSD integrates problem solving, synthesis, and modeling in a single homogeneous programming/design environment. We demonstrate the problem-solving capabilities of LSD using the masterkeying problem.","","0-7695-1644-0","","10.1109/HCC.2002.1046356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046356","","Bonding;Buildings;Computer languages;Computer science;Design automation;Logic programming;Problem-solving;Process design;Programming profession;Solids","CAD;logic programming;problem solving;symbol manipulation;user interfaces;visual languages","CAD;LSD;Language for Structured Design;descriptive specifications;design problems;logic-based visual design environment;masterkeying problem;object families;programming languages;symbolic problem-solving capability;visual logic programming language","","0","","3","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mentioned evaluation is concerned on over limited velocity vehicles which are violating the driving laws, including security considerations. An utilized thermograph technique, in this research, for detecting and evaluating vehicles that are running with the over limited velocity is the consideration of colorsÂ¿ cluster underneath vehicles. The mentioned colorsÂ¿ cluster represents reflected heat between the road and vehicle. To implement such method for evaluating the velocity of vehicle, the movement of colorsÂ¿ cluster implicitly shows the velocity of vehicle. The average velocity of colorsÂ¿ cluster is able to be evaluated by finding the different positions of the cluster from consecutive imageÂ¿s frames and dividing by time interval. By means of utilizing such method, various average velocities of focused vehicles can be found, including not over and over limited speed. When implementing the mentioned method to sample thermal images which are recorded from a nighttime traffic road in Rangsit-Nakornayok area, it is found that 82.54 % accuracy occurred when inspecting on various type of vehicle comprises car, van, bus, and truck that running over the specified velocity.","","978-1-4244-2857-1","978-1-4244-2858-8","10.1109/ITST.2008.4740246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740246","","Charge coupled devices;Focusing;Intelligent transportation systems;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic sensors;Road vehicles;Security;Vehicle detection;Vehicle driving;Wireless sensor networks","automated highways;image colour analysis;image representation;infrared imaging;pattern clustering;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","driving law violation;image frame cluster;intelligent transportation system;limited velocity vehicle;nighttime-traffic evaluation;thermography;vehicle color cluster representation","","1","","8","","","24-24 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20080812","2008","","","625","629","The wireless mesh network (WMN) is a novel wireless network architecture that puts several wireless routers into wireless ad hoc networks for mobile nodes to access the Internet. Due to the similarity in network topology between WMN and the Mobile ad hoc network (MANET), the routing algorithm from MANET can be adopted to WMN. Traditionally, the routing algorithms in MANET choose the shortest route to build up the communication path; however, this manner may incur traffic unbalanced problems in the WMN. Those routing algorithm cannot fully utilize system capacity. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a delay-based RREP routing named DRR to balance the traffic loading. The concept of DRR is to convert the factor of node load into the time. Once the intermediate node receives an RREQ packet, an internal extra delay proportional to the node loading is added before forwarding this RREQ packet. Using the DRR scheme, the first replied RREP packet stands for the optimal path that considers the metrics of path distance, path hop-count, intermediate node load, and neighboring node load. In this work, we also propose a new weight assignment scheme in which the node weights are proportional to the exponential of node loading. It is used to differentiate the node in different loads in order to arrive at load balanced routing. Simulation results reveal that the DRR can flexibly spread traffic among all nodes and that it extends the lifetime of an entire ad hoc network by fairly consuming each nodepsilas energy.","","978-0-7695-3287-5","","10.1109/ICESS.2008.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595620","Load balance;MANET;Routing scheme;WMN","Ad hoc networks;Delay;IP networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless mesh networks","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;radio networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","Internet;delay-based RREQ scheme;intermediate node load;load balanced routing;mobile ad hoc network;mobile node;neighboring node load;network topology;path distance;path hop-count;weight assignment scheme;wireless ad hoc network;wireless mesh networks;wireless network architecture;wireless routers","","1","","12","","","29-31 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Critical to the successful observations was continuous availability of power from its solar arrays during sunlit periods, and from nickel-hydrogen batteries when the satellite was in the Earth's shadow. The adopted nickel-hydrogen batteries were carefully selected and tested to confirm their depth-of-discharge and operating temperature that delivered the longest life in charge/discharge cycling service. These batteries had a design life of 7 years. At 12 years after launch the Hubble batteries have delivered more charge/discharge cycles than any other batteries in low-Earth orbit. However, the Hubble batteries have been subjected to many unexpected stresses, and peculiar reductions in battery capacity have been observed. Battery replacement requires a costly trip to the Hubble Space Telescope by astronauts, so the remaining useful life of the batteries must be predicted. Already in four servicing missions, astronauts have replaced or modified optics, solar arrays, a power control unit, and various science packages. A fifth servicing mission is scheduled in 2004.

Variations in wind power results in a significant number of current load cycles during service. The current can increase from zero to maximum rated load in a short time. This can cause high temperature gradients in the cable systems inducing significant thermo-mechanical forces during heating and cooling, and thermal oxidation at high load. Several premature service failures of cable joints in wind farm distribution networks have occurred, mainly due to the combined action of bad metallic connectors and high load current. Partial discharge measurements are today performed on-site using different frequencies and magnitudes of the test voltage. As the oxidation process causes the conductivity of the bulk and surfaces of the materials involved to strongly increase, this will also likely impact the frequency dependence of the partial discharges. This work includes laboratory high temperature ageing of rubber type heat-shrink MV XLPE cable joints including temperature gradients by application of high load currents. The ageing has been electrically characterised by variable partial discharge measurements in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 Hz up to 12 kV (2 U<sub>0</sub>). The joint material was examined by microscopy examinations after ageing. The results show that the partial discharges are strongly frequency and voltage dependent. For shorter ageing times of the rubber joints, the number of discharges per voltage cycle decrease to zero for frequencies below 10 Hz. At longer ageing times resulting in severe material ageing, the number of discharges per voltage cycle strongly increases by decreasing frequency. In this case the inception voltage at 0.1 Hz was equal or lower than that measured at higher frequencies. It is observed by SEM that especially the stress-control material was strongly degraded by the high temperature conditions.","0084-9162","978-1-4673-1253-0","978-1-4673-1251-6","10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378907","","Aging;Frequency measurement;Joints;Partial discharges;Power cables;Temperature measurement;Voltage measurement","XLPE insulation;ageing;distribution networks;failure analysis;heat sinks;insulator testing;oxidation;partial discharge measurement;power cable insulation;power cable testing;scanning electron microscopy;wind power plants","SEM;cooling;current load cycles;frequency 10 mHz to 100 Hz;frequency dependence;heating;high temperature gradients;laboratory high temperature ageing;material ageing;metallic connectors;microscopy examinations;partial discharge measurements;rubber type heat-shrink MV XLPE cable joints;service failures;stress-control material;thermal oxidation process;thermally aged medium voltage XLPE cable joint diagnostic testing;thermomechanical forces;underground cable systems;wind farm distribution network;wind power","","0","","7","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is expected to be useful in situations where limited time is available for transmission imaging (e.g., whole-body PET). The proposed method uses 2-min transmission scans that are reconstructed and then segmented into regions of uniform attenuation. Consistency information is used to determine the thresholds for segmentation of the transmission image and the attenuation coefficients. In particular, a downhill simplex algorithm is used to find the parameters that are most consistent with the measured emission data. One potential advantage of the proposed technique over conventional segmentation methods (which work purely on the transmission data) is that the emission data are used to drive the segmentation process. Therefore, the technique should produce the attenuation image that is most appropriate for attenuation correction. The algorithm is tested using simulated data and compared with an adaptive thresholding technique using clinical PET data. The results show that the method produces reconstructed images with similar accuracy and noise levels to those obtained using a 10 min transmission scan. The results also show that the proposed technique has some advantages over the adaptive thresholding technique when imaging the abdomen. The authors conclude that the proposed technique may provide a viable means of producing quantitatively accurate whole-body PET images in a clinically feasible time.","0018-9499","","","10.1109/TNS.2003.812451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208606","","Abdomen;Attenuation;Biomedical engineering;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Noise level;Particle measurements;Positron emission tomography;Testing;Whole-body PET","image reconstruction;image segmentation;medical image processing;positron emission tomography","10 min;2 min;PET;Radon transform;abdomen;adaptive thresholding technique;attenuation correction;consistency information;downhill simplex algorithm;image reconstruction;image segmentation;positron emission tomography;short transmission scans;transmission scans;uniform attenuation","","11","","8","","","June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The technique in effect provides a structured procedure for spreading-out the linear array excitations, thereby eliminating any guesswork that may be required. The final planar array excitations are very simply related to the excitation coefficients of the archetypal linear array. This means that the technique can be used to rapidly synthesize even very large arrays.

The conventional techniques are phase-locked loop (PLL), digital PLL, or direct-digital synthesis (DDS). With any one or a combination of these techniques, high performance can be achieved at the expense of complexity or cost. In this paper, another technique, the injection locking technique, is explored to provide synchronization for a direct-conversion receiver. More specifically, signal synchronization is achieved with a selectable dielectric-resonator injection locked oscillator (DRILO) designed at a free running frequency of 3.634 GHz. The receiver developed was able to recover the carrier and IQ signals from 3.58 GHz, 3.63 GHz and 3.69 GHz with 50 Msps to 63 Msps QPSK modulated signals. The receiver designed as such is novel and simple, and can find applications in many modern communications such as WiMax.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the placement repeatability of two flip chip die placement machines: one using leadscrew, the other using a linear motor. The study was conducted using a clear quartz die screen-printed with solder bumps. The quartz die were flipped, and placed onto a substrate. The die was firmly secured on the substrate using a transparent double-sided tape. The bumps near the four corners were measured using a high accuracy, automatic focusing optical microscope, and misplacements were calculated. By plotting X and Y misplacements of the four designated bumps on the quartz die, the rotational and translational placement errors were decomposed, and independently obtained. There are four spindles in each machine. By comparing the errors with the placement specifications, the placement capability was obtained. It was found that Machine B (linear motor) was more capable than Machine A (leadscrew), for all four spindles in both translational and rotational movements. Machine B was capable of delivering a 6-sigma process for a pitch of 225 μm, with ±45 μm specification limits. However, it was not quite capable of delivering a 6-sigma process for the fine pitch (150 μm, with a ±30 μm specification limits). It was also found that the reflected light from the spindle heads affected significantly the placement accuracy, because the light reflection influenced the effectiveness of the machine vision. Since the error analysis was relatively easy to perform, the error handling technique was used to optimize the die placement accuracy by altering the die placement sequence","","0-7803-5038-3","","10.1109/AIM.1999.803217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=803217","","Assembly systems;Error analysis;Flip chip;Focusing;Head;Laboratories;Lead;Microassembly;Optical microscopy;Substrates","computer vision;flip-chip devices;linear motors;microassembling;process control","6-sigma process;assembly yield;automatic focusing optical microscope;clear quartz die;die placement sequence;error analysis;error handling technique;fine pitch flip chip technology;flip chip die attach machines;leadscrew;light reflection;linear motor;machine vision;misplacements;placement repeatability;solder bumps","","0","","2","","","1999","19 Sep 1999-23 Sep 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Special attention has been given to analysis of operation of six-phase drives in the zone of over modulation. The spectra of the phase voltage of the six-phase vehicle drives with synchronized PWM do not contain even harmonics and sub-harmonics during the whole control range, which is especially important for the high power/current applications.

In addition to the robot control, it is also useful to study some intermediate controllability properties of the object's impact Poincare mapping, which generally takes the form of a nonlinear discrete-time system. The force input mainly consists of a family of dead-beat feedback control laws, introduced via a recursive procedure, and exploiting the underlying discrete-time structure of the system.

Core-shell spheres have attracted significant interests in metamaterial community. Basically combination of a positive permittivity dielectric and a negative permittivity plasmonic material not only can control the resonances but also the effective material permittivity locally. This means one can use an array of coreshell spheres where, for instance, each has a different core size and as such tailor a desired material property across the array. Basically, any material can be engineered with core-shell spheres made from only two materials (the main concept of digital metamaterial).While the concept is very promising the computation is very challenging. This is due to the having a large finite array of different core-shells of dispersive materials and the fact that they can be located very close to each other. This will face us a broad-spectrum eigenvalue problem which makes simulation based on numerical methods very challenging, if not impossible. We need to add to these the cases which core-shells have eccentric geometries either due to the requirement to achieve a physic of interest or the fabrication practicality. In present work, an analytical solution for the problem of scattering by a cluster of eccentric core-shell spheres is demonstrated. Full wave multipole expansion method is applied to express the electromagnetic fields in terms of the electric and magnetic dipole modes and the higher order moments. Addition theorems will be implemented to expand fields in desired coordinate systems and to apply boundary conditions successfully. The solution of large array of eccentric plasmonic and dielectric core-shell spheres is determined, and unique physics in the area of metamaterials, changing the element configuration, is described. Novel applications will be highlighted. Associated mathematics and speed and memory improvements for the problems investigated will be discussed.","","","","10.1109/USNC-URSI.2014.6955399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955399","","Arrays;Magnetic cores;Magnetic materials;Metamaterials;Permittivity;Plasmons","optical metamaterials;permittivity;plasmonics","array modeling;core-shell finite array;core-shell spheres;dispersive material;eccentric core-shell plasmonic spheres;higher order moment;negative permittivity plasmonic material;positive permittivity dielectric","","0","","","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ADSIP will serve as a diagnosis assistant for a smart wearable computing system and aims to provide elderly people suffering from chronic diseases with reliable health status diagnosis in real time. The smart wearable computing system addresses unobtrusive and long-term home and outdoor health monitoring, for the purpose of supporting elderly people in leading an independent life with more mobility, flexibility, and safety. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is chosen as the initial application domain. To achieve reliable health status diagnosis, the proposed approach for ADSIP is to individualize the decision support system by means of learning an individual person's health characteristics repeatedly at certain time intervals from measured sensor data and user input, so that a dynamic decision-theoretic model can be adapted gradually to this person's individual health condition. It is expected that with ADSIP, measured deviations from the norm can be categorized either as a critical situation or as a normal uncritical variation, depending on an elderly person's individual health characteristics. As a consequence, false positive health status diagnoses will be reduced and false negative diagnoses will be avoided.","","978-1-4673-1536-4","","10.1109/ICIS.2012.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211101","Ambient Assisted Living;COPD;Decision Support;Health Care;Health Monitoring;Wearable Sensors","Biomedical monitoring;Data models;Decision support systems;Diseases;Monitoring;Reliability;Senior citizens","computerised instrumentation;decision support systems;decision theory;diseases;geriatrics;health care;human computer interaction;intelligent sensors;medical diagnostic computing;patient monitoring","ADSIP;COPD;adaptive decision support system-for-individual persons;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;diagnosis assistant;dynamic decision-theoretic model;elderly people;long-term home health monitoring;outdoor health monitoring;reliable health status diagnosis;smart wearable computing system","","0","","16","","","May 30 2012-June 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, large arrays of electrodes with many contacts that are individually wired to external recording systems are cumbersome and make chronic recording in freely behaving small animals challenging. Multiplexed headstages overcome this limitation by combining the signals from many electrodes to a smaller number of connections directly on the animal's head. Commercially available multiplexed headstages provide high performance integrated amplification, multiplexing and analog to digital conversion[1], [2]. However, the cost of these systems can be prohibitive for small labs or for experiments that require a large number of animals to be continuously recorded at the same time. Here we have developed a multiplexed 60-channel headstage amplifier optimized to chronically record electrophysiological signals from high-density μECoG electrode arrays. A single, ultraflexible (2mm thickness) microHDMI cable provided the data interface. Using low cost components, we have reduced the cost of the multiplexed headstage to ~$125. Paired with a custom interface printed circuit board (PCB) and a general purpose data acquisition system (M-series DAQ, National Instruments), an inexpensive and customizable electrophysiology system is assembled. Open source LabVIEW software that we have previously released [3] controlled the system. It can also be used with other open source neural data acquisition packages [4][5]. Combined, we have presented a scalable, low-cost platform for high-channel count electrophysiology.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944811","","Analog-digital conversion;Cable shielding;Connectors;Data acquisition;Electrodes;Multiplexing;Noise","bioelectric phenomena;brain;data acquisition;virtual instrumentation","Open source LabVIEW software;analog-to-digital conversion;chronic μECoG recordings;data acquisition system;data interface;integrated amplification;microHDMI cable;microelectrocorticography;multiplexed electrophysiology system;multiplexed headstages;printed circuit board;rodents","","0","","","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture provides many benefits compared with special-purpose approaches, including heterogeneity, reuse of application and system code, and sharing of resources. The architecture also poses new challenges to both computer system implementers and users. First, traditional local-area networks do not have enough bandwidth and create a communication bottleneck, thus seriously limiting the set of applications that can be run effectively. Second, programmers have to deal with large bodies of code distributed over a variety of architectures, and work in an environment where both the network and nodes are shared with other users. Our experience in the Nectar project shows that it is possible to overcome these problems. We show how networks based on high-speed crossbar switches and efficient protocol implementations can support high bandwidth and low latency communication while still enjoying the flexibility of general networks, and we use three applications to demonstrate that network-based multicomputers are a practical architecture. We also show how the network traffic generated by this new class of applications poses severe requirements for networks","1045-9219","","","10.1109/71.532117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=532117","","Application software;Bandwidth;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Delay;Local area networks;Programming profession;Protocols;Supercomputers;Switches","distributed processing;multiprocessor interconnection networks;parallel architectures;protocols","Nectar project;heterogeneity;high-speed crossbar switches;low latency communication;network traffic;network-based multicomputers;protocol implementations;resources sharing;reuse of application code;supercomputer architecture;system code","","2","","67","","","Aug 1996","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose, a large input capacitor has traditionally been used. However, when reducing that capacitor's size, the nonlinearities of the PV array make the performance of the voltage regulation become highly dependent on the operating point. This paper analyzes the nonlinear characteristics of the PV generator and clearly states their effect on the control of the dc/dc boost stage of commercial converters by means of a linearization around the operating point. Then, it proposes an adaptive control, which enables the use of a small input capacitor preserving at the same time the performance of the original system with a large capacitor. Experimental results are carried out for a commercial converter with a 40 μF input capacitor, and a 4 kW PV array. The results corroborate the theoretical analysis; they evidence the problems of the traditional control, and validate the proposed control with such a small capacitor.","0885-8993","","","10.1109/TPEL.2013.2240702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6414653","Adaptive control;photovoltaic converters;photovoltaic power systems;small-signal modeling;voltage control","Arrays;Capacitors;Cutoff frequency;Inductors;Resistance;Transfer functions;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;adaptive control;capacitors;linearisation techniques;nonlinear systems;photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;voltage control","DC/DC boost stage;PV array;PV converters;adaptive control;adaptive voltage control;capacitor;commercial converter;linearization;nonlinear characteristics;nonlinearities;photovoltaic systems;small input capacitor;theoretical analysis;voltage regulation","","12","","36","","2013-01-17","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To accurately determine the true incoming count rate and spectrum, one must determine and correct for these losses. Many correction methods were developed using analog shaping amplifiers and multichannel analyzers, providing the concepts and terms traditionally used to describe these losses and correction factors. Digital pulse processors have a much higher throughput due to fundamental differences in their deadtime and pile-up characteristics. They also permit improved variations of the traditional correction methods. This paper will highlight key distinctions between analog and digital approaches, the implementation used in Amptek’s DP5 digital pulse processor, and show measured results. The DP5 was designed to support Amptek’s silicon drift diodes, operating at input count rates up to 10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> at a peaking time of 0.6 μs with an accurate determination of input spectrum and count rate. Several different deadtime correction algorithms and pile-up rejection algorithms were tested for the DP5 and their measured performance will be presented.","1095-7863","978-1-4244-2714-7","978-1-4244-2715-4","10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4775075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4775075","","Finite impulse response filter;Logic;Nuclear and plasma sciences;Pulse amplifiers;Pulse measurements;Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Signal processing algorithms;Spectroscopy;Tail","","","","0","","7","","","19-25 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, if we consider a wearable robot/joint as the robot/joint operated by the daily skills, it is necessary to control the robot/joint so that kinesthetic feeling induced by the kinetic characteristic of an object is directly transmitted to a wearer, without any distortion by the kinetic characteristic of the wearable robot/joint itself. This is the control issue of ""kinesthetic transparency"". This paper discusses a method of control to improve kinesthetic transparency of a wearable joint. Kinesthetic transparency can be basically improved by active compensation. In order to avoid necessity of offline estimation for unknown kinetic parameters of the joint, this paper formulates a control law which automatically estimates the unknown parameters during operation of the joint. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the method. However, experimental results reveal that accurate compensation of frictional terms is necessary for further improvement.","","0-7803-8463-6","","10.1109/IROS.2004.1389407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1389407","","Automatic control;Control systems;Electromyography;Humans;Intelligent systems;Kinetic theory;Parameter estimation;Robotics and automation;Robots;Signal generators","manipulators","active compensation;kinesthetic feeling;kinesthetic transparency;kinetic parameters;manipulated object;offline estimation;transparency improvement;wearable joint","","0","","11","","","28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are also used but their jitter is larger than that of DLLs, because DLLs have no jitter accumulation. However, conventional DLLs have design problems. One is that their phase capture ranges are limited, and another is that a special reset sequence is required. Dual DLL architectures are developed to overcome these problems. In these architectures, the latency from the input to the output, however, is lengthened to attain high resolution, because these architectures require a number of multiplexers between the DLL input and output ports. As a result, supply-noise induced jitter increases. To reduce the jitter, a portable digital DLL uses the following techniques: (1) a master-slave architecture, which achieves infinite phase capture ranges and eliminates the special reset requirement, (2) a wave synchronous latch circuit, which maintains high resolution, and (3) a dynamic phase detector, which improves phase comparison sensitivity.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839811","","Circuits;Delay;Detectors;Jitter;Latches;Master-slave;Microprocessors;Multiplexing;Phase detection;Phase locked loops","delay lock loops;digital phase locked loops;jitter;phase detectors","1 GHz;dynamic phase detector;high-speed microprocessors;infinite phase capture ranges;latency;master-slave architecture;phase comparison sensitivity;portable digital delay-locked loop;reset sequence;resolution;signal phases;supply-noise induced jitter;wave synchronous latch circuit","","18","2","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new method - small-step retraction - that helps PRM planners find paths through such passages. The method consists of slightly fattening the robot's free space, constructing a roadmap in the fattened free space, and repairing colliding portions of this roadmap by retracting them out of collision. The fattened free space is not explicitly computed. Instead, the robot links and/or obstacles are thinned around their medial axis. A robot configuration lies in fattened free space if the thinned objects do not collide at this configuration. Two repair strategies are used. The ""optimist"" strategy waits until a complete path has been found in fattened free space before repairing it. The ""pessimist"" strategy repairs the roadmap as it is being built. The former is faster, but the latter is more reliable. A simple combination yields an integrated planner that is both fast and reliable.","","0-7803-8912-3","","10.1109/IROS.2005.1545606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1545606","Path planning;narrow passages;probabilistic roadmap;small-step retraction","Artificial intelligence;Computational geometry;Costs;Laboratories;Orbital robotics;Path planning;Road accidents;Robots;Solid modeling;Testing","motion control;path planning;probability","PRM planners;narrow passages;path finding;path planning;probabilistic roadmaps;robot configuration;small-step retraction","","12","","25","","","2-6 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These additions of test cases create possibility of presence of redundant test cases. Due to limitation of time and resource, reduction techniques should be used to identify and remove them. Research shows that a subset of the test case in a suit may still satisfy all the test objectives which is called as representative set. Redundant test case increase the execution cost of the test suite, in spite of NP-completeness of the problem there are few good reduction techniques have been available.

Its advantages are: a near-zero temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), ease of manufacture, and mechanical and electrical stability during later high-temperature integrated circuit processing steps and during lifetests. This resistor process consistently achieves 0.015%/ degrees C TCR (2.1% total change for -55 to +85 degrees C). This is 20 times smaller than the TCR from a typical metal film or active GaAs resistor. This resistor is fabricated by alloying an evaporated Pt film of critical thickness. The TCR is in fact adjustable from -0.12%/ degrees C to +0.18%/ degrees C by adjusting the initial Pt film thickness. A reliable, low resistance contact is achieved by depositing a contact metallurgy before alloying to avoid having to make electrical contact through the insulating GaO layer that forms during the alloying process. The resistor is stable to high process temperatures and has long-term reliability because of the high alloying temperature of 525 degrees C.<<ETX>>","","","","10.1109/GAAS.1990.175499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=175499","","Alloying;Contacts;Electric resistance;Gallium arsenide;MMICs;Microwave integrated circuits;Monolithic integrated circuits;Platinum;Resistors;Temperature","MMIC;gallium alloys;integrated circuit technology;platinum alloys;platinum compounds;resistors","-55 to 85 degC;525 degC;GaAs;GaPt-PtAs/sub 2/;MMICs;alloying process;alloying temperature;contact metallurgy;electrical stability;evaporated Pt film;integrated circuit resistor;long-term reliability;low TCR;mechanical stability;monolithic microwave integrated circuits;temperature coefficient of resistance","","0","","3","","","7-10 Oct. 1990","07 Oct 1990-10 Oct 1990","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overarching program goal is graduation of a new pedigree of qualified engineers with the ""soft skills"", business acumen and strategic foresight, in addition to engineering prowess, to meet the needs of industry in the 21st century. Following the recommendation from James Duderstadt's ""Engineering for a Changing World"", we propose a new paradigm for the education of the engineering leaders of the 21st century. The Duderstadt model mirrors the medical school training model that is credited with propelling advancement in medical practice during the last century, where the BS degree includes a broad-based curriculum of engineering design, project management, technology, ingenuity and innovation, along with business, communication, ethics, and social sciences. This foundation is then followed by post-graduate study, via a professional Master's degree program, in a specific discipline or concentration. The Leadership Engineering degree program is a first important, and viable, step towards that new paradigm. A large fraction of the graduates of the Leadership Engineering program are anticipated to pursue professional graduate degrees in a variety of engineering fields. Through a curriculum that provides a framework for building successful businesses, students graduating from the program may also move into the booming technology services sector or choose to start their own innovative companies. Finally, graduates of the Leadership Engineering program will be prepared to serve as leadership engineering educators in the K-12 sector, or for further graduate preparation in the expanding field of engineering education.","","978-1-4244-6040-3","","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508824","","Biomedical engineering;Business;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Industrial training;Management training;Mirrors;Project management;Propulsion;Technological innovation","biomedical education;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;management education;professional aspects","BS degree;Duderstadt model;El Paso;University of Texas;engineering design;engineering leader education;leadership engineering degree program;medical school training;post graduate study;professional Master degree program;professional graduate degrees;project management;social sciences;undergraduate program","","0","","27","","","6-9 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reason for that is the enhanced capabilities and built-in mobility support provided by IPv6 thorough its dedicated protocol - namely Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). One of the major improvements for MIPv6 promises is what is referred to as 'Route Optimization' (RO). MIPv6 RO is a sequence of processes that enables two mobile nodes to communication directly without having to go through an intermediate node. Obviously, this eliminates the drawbacks of triangular routing (as in MIPv4) and moreover, allows for the end-to-end communication model IPv6 aims to achieve. However, the RO process includes a security vulnerability associated with one of its sub-processes, the 'return routability procedure' (RRP). In this paper, we address the security of the RRP in MIPv6 and propose the use of Identity-based schemes for that purpose.","","","","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682254","MIPv6 RRP;RRP security;security of MIPv6 RRP","Manganese;Mobile nodes;Protocols;Public key","IP networks;cryptography;mobile communication;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication network routing","IPv4;Internet addressing protocol;MIPv6;Mobile IPv6;RRP;end-to-end communication model;identity-based schemes;mobile communication;mobility support;return routability procedure;route optimization;security vulnerability;triangular routing","","0","","","","","20-23 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VRLA batteries suffer somewhat reduced capacity compared to flooded batteries although the specific energy may be higher. VRLA batteries are much more difficult to charge correctly and the charging practices generally have to be modified during the life of the battery because of changes within the grids, active material, amount and composition of the electrolyte, as well as the electrochemical potentials of the plates. There are three major problems with VRLA batteries which cause them to fail prematurely. These are the sudden loss of capacity, gradual loss of capacity, and the inability to recharge the negative plate. These conditions have been deemed premature capacity loss by the ALABC.

In this paper, to solve these problems, a new method is proposed to design a reconfigurable smart sensor interface for industrial WSN in IoT environment, in which complex programmable logic device (CPLD) is adopted as the core controller. Thus, it can read data in parallel and in real time with high speed on multiple different sensor data. The standard of IEEE1451.2 intelligent sensor interface specification is adopted for this design. It comprehensively stipulates the smart sensor hardware and software design framework and relevant interface protocol to realize the intelligent acquisition for common sensors. A new solution is provided for the traditional sensor data acquisitions.

These heaters have open diamond-shaped unit cells defined by 12 mu m-wide 3 mu m-thick bulk silicon beams and provide an overall electrical resistance of 3-10 Omega . The thermal resistance is typically 4-6 degrees C/mW so that the heater temperature rises approximately 22 degrees C for input current levels of 25 mA. Using Freon-11 as the cavity fluid with partial filling, very modest drive levels are thus able to sustain a 1-atm pressure rise within the cavity. Overdriving the heaters at 100 mW results in a simulated pressure rise of 1 atm in 40 ms, showing that operation can be rapid as well.<<ETX>>","","0-87942-585-7","","10.1109/SENSOR.1991.149073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=149073","","Actuators;Circuits;Computer science;Electric resistance;Filling;Glass;Microactuators;Resistance heating;Silicon;Thermal resistance","actuators;liquid-vapour transformations;micromechanical devices;silicon","3 to 10 ohm;Freon-11;Si cap;liquid-vapor phase-change;microactuator;open diamond-shaped unit cells;partially filled closed cavity;rapid operation;thermally-driven phase-change","","6","1","19","","","24-27 June 1991","24 Jun 1991-27 Jun 1991","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Perfect tracking control methodology using multirate feedforward control was proposed by H. Fujimoto, et. al. Furthermore, A. Shimada, et. al. have described its application to robot manipulators; however, they only described the controller design process and gave a few simulation results. In addition, they did not provide details on how the state reference should be designed. Even if experiments are attempted, it is difficult to evaluate control performance since generally manipulators have joint angle sensors mounted on the output side of reduction gears, especially since the product of the angle of rotors and the reduction gear ratio does not always correspond with the joint angles. In order to solve this problem, this paper illustrates the design process for a state reference for manipulators, and introduces a prototype robot manipulator that has precision rotary encoders installed on the output side of the joints. This means that the manipulator as a platform not only has rotary encoders attached to servo motors but special rotary encoders.

In micro-fluidic 3-D angiogenic sprouting experiments, two types of images are obtained at discrete time steps using confocal microscopy: a) three-dimensional fluorescent images of stained cell nuclei and b) two dimensional visible light images of the gel matrix. These two sources of images provide supplementary information as the outline of the conduit or lumen formed in the matrix by the migrating cells can be seen in the images of the gel. A Bayesian filtering framework is developed which augments both the cell and conduit parameters to the same state vector, allowing mathematically consistent simultaneous observation updates from both channels.

This should be done carefully, because an improper compensation function can extremely amplify the noise. Our aim is to find a compensation function in the knowledge of the original nonlinear transfer function, which can keep both the distortion and the noise level low. In this paper we will show the further developments of our method, which can estimate the optimal level of noise suppression of the compensation function, based on Tikhonov's regularization technique.

The intensity of the Brillouin signal decreases significantly as early as 5 h postmortem. Moreover, the fluctuation of the Brillouin frequency shift inside the lens increases with postmortem time. Images of lens tissue taken with a confocal reflectance microscope between measurements reveal a degenerative aging process.

Four simulation rounds were conducted using CASIA database, each with different coefficients, namely 48, 32, 16 and 8 AC coefficients. It turned out that using as many as 8 AC coefficients from each DCT block resulted in a higher matching rate than using other number of AC coefficients of the block. The proposed method can increase averaged matching rate as much as 5% when using 8 AC coefficients.

Among the features that deserve a careful scrutiny, there is the investigation of the distributed synchronous generator dynamics under severe operating conditions, including the relevant dynamic associated to its control loops. In this context, this paper presents an analysis of the actuation of the under-excitation limiter, when operating in synchronous generators subject to load imbalance between phases. In addition, the effect of different representations of the generator terminal voltage transducer (which is used as a feedback signal to the excitation system and its associated elements) on the actuation of the under-excitation limiter was evaluated. The obtained results show that significant levels of imbalance, associated with certain terminal voltage transducer representations, may have an adverse impact on the actuation of the under-excitation limiter.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939080","Distributed Generation;Distributed Synchronous Generator;Unbalanced Electrical Systems;Underexcitation Limiter;Voltage Transducer","Analytical models;Load modeling;Power system stability;Reactive power;Synchronous generators;Transducers","distributed power generation;electric actuators;electric sensing devices;limiters;synchronous generators;transducers","control loop;distributed synchronous generator dynamics;feedback signal;generator terminal voltage transducer;low-frequency oscillation;minimum energy quality criteria;phase imbalance;unbalanced load condition;underexcitation limiter actuation evaluation","","0","","","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools that feature MSC do not have the ability to check model or implementation executions against the specified behavior. We present a method for observing the behavior of timed systems specified using Message Sequence Chart Graphs (MSC-Graphs) (a simplified version of ITU Z.120 notation). We believe that a log-analyzer and a run-time monitor based on MSC-Graphs are practical and powerful tools to improve the quality of real-time systems. On one hand, the log analyzer can play the role of an Oracle while testing non-functional requirements. On the other hand, the run-time monitor can help in the verification of protocol assertions given in terms of message interchange annotated with time constraints. The work is built over a formal definition of the syntax and semantics of MSC-Graphs, which is similar to (Alur and Yannakakis, 1999) (i.e. based on partial orders). Those MSC-Graphs are enriched with timers and delay intervals in a similar way to (Ben-Abdallah and Leue, 1997) and (Li and Lilius, 1999).","","1-58113-472-X","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008042","","Delay;Monitoring;Permission;Protocols;Real time systems;Runtime;Software architecture;Testing;Time factors;Timing","diagrams;formal specification;real-time systems;software tools","MSC-Graphs;Message Sequence Chart Graphs;formal specification;log-analyzer;message interchange;protocol assertion verification;real-time systems;run-time monitor;semantics;software tools;syntax;timed systems","","0","","","","","25-25 May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A corresponding receiver structure is presented, where multiple layers can be decoupled by iterative MIMO detection and equalization with ordered successive interference cancellation (SIC) and full log-likelihood ratio (LLR).

However, environmental characterization by fixed distributed sensors encounters challenges in complex environments. In this paper we describe Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS), a new distributed, robotic sensor methodology developed for applications including characterization of environmental structure and phenomena. NIMS exploits deployed infrastructure that provides the benefits of precise motion, aerial suspension, and low energy sustainable operations in complex environments. NIMS nodes may explore a three-dimensional environment and enable the deployment of sensor nodes at diverse locations and viewing perspectives. NIMS characterization of phenomena in a three dimensional space must now consider the selection of sensor sampling points in both time and space. Thus, we introduce a new approach of mobile node adaptive sampling with the objective of minimizing error between the actual and reconstructed spatiotemporal behavior of environmental variables while minimizing required motion. In this approach, the NIMS node first explores as an agent, gathering a statistical description of phenomena using a nested stratified random sampling approach. By iteratively increasing sampling resolution, guided adaptively by the measurement results themselves, this NIMS sampling enables reconstruction of phenomena with a systematic method for balancing accuracy with sampling resource cost in time and motion. This adaptive sampling method is described analytically and also tested with simulated environmental data. Experimental evaluations of adaptive sampling algorithms have also been completed. Specifically, NIMS experimental systems have been developed for monitoring of spatiotemporal variation of atmospheric climate phenomena. A NIMS system has been deployed at a field biology station to map phenomena in a 50m width and 50m span transect in a forest environment. In addition, deployments have occurred in testbed environments allowing additional detailed characterization of sampling algorithms. Environmental variable mapping of temperature, humidity, and solar illumination have been acquired and used to evaluat- e the adaptive sampling methods reported here. These new methods have been shown to provide a significant advance for efficient mapping of spatially distributed phenomena by NIMS environmental robotics.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232-3","","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1308801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1308801","","Costs;Extraterrestrial phenomena;Motion measurement;Robot sensing systems;Sampling methods;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems and applications;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Testing;Time measurement","distributed sensors;environmental engineering;robots;sampling methods;spatiotemporal phenomena","adaptive sampling;aerial suspension;atmospheric climate phenomena;complex environments;distributed sensors;environmental robotics;environmental variable mapping;field biology station;forest environment;humidity;low energy sustainable operations;nested stratified random sampling approach;networked infomechanical systems;networked sensors;precise motion;robotic sensor;sampling algorithms;sensor nodes;sensor sampling points;simulated environmental data;solar illumination;spatially distributed phenomena;spatiotemporal behavior;spatiotemporal variation;temperature;testbed environments;three dimensional space;three-dimensional environment","","29","","","","","April 26-May 1, 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The control system is designed in stationary frame, with harmonic compensation in parallel and no coupled terms between axes. In this control system, current/voltage controllers and droop controllers are reached in the first level. Controllers to restore the deviation caused by droop are achieved in the second level.

Yet the microscopic size and highly specular and textureless nature of the surfaces make the task difficult. It is also demanded that the size of the entire inspection system be small so as to minimize restraint on the operation of the various moving parts involved in the manufacturing process. In this paper, we describe a new 3-D reconstruction mechanism for the task. The mechanism is based upon the well-known concept of structured-light projection, but adapted to a new configuration that owns a particularly small system size and operates in a different manner. Unlike the traditional mechanisms which involve an array of light sources that occupy a rather extended physical space, the proposed mechanism consists of only a single light source plus a binary grating for projecting binary pattern. To allow the projection at each position of the inspected surface to vary and form distinct binary code, the binary grating is shifted in space. In every shift, a separate image of the illuminated surface is taken. With the use of pattern projection, and of discrete coding instead of analog coding in the projection, issues like texture-absence, image saturation, and image noise of the inspected surfaces are much lessened. Experimental results on a variety of objects are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this mechanism.","1521-334X","","","10.1109/TEPM.2007.914209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427306","3-D reconstruction;Binary pattern projection;Ronchi pattern;fringe boundary detection;specular surface;wafer bump","Gratings;Image coding;Inspection;Light sources;Manufacturing;Microscopy;Surface reconstruction;Surface texture;Three dimensional displays;Wafer bonding","bonding processes;soldering","3D reconstruction;advanced electronic manufacturing;analog coding;die-to-die bonding;fringe boundary detection;single fixed fringe grating;solder bumps;structured-light based sensing","","6","","26","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The solution is defined in maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense and it appears as the global minimum of an energy function joining a convex data-fidelity term and a Markovian prior energy. The sought images are composed of nearly homogeneous zones separated by edges and the prior term accounts for this knowledge. This term combines general nonconvex potential functions (PFs) which are applied to the differences between neighboring pixels. The resultant MAP energy generally exhibits numerous local minima. Calculating its local minimum, placed in the vicinity of the maximum likelihood estimate, is inexpensive but the resultant estimate is usually disappointing. Optimization using simulated annealing is practical only in restricted situations. Several deterministic suboptimal techniques approach the global minimum of special MAP energies, employed in the field of image denoising, at a reasonable numerical cost. The latter techniques are not directly applicable to general observation systems, nor to general Markovian prior energies. This work is devoted to the generalization of one of them, the graduated nonconvexity (GNC) algorithm, in order to calculate nearly-optimal MAP solutions in a wide range of situations. In fact, GNC provides a solution by tracking a set of minima along a sequence of approximate energies, starting from a convex energy and progressing toward the original energy. In this paper, we develop a common method to derive efficient GNC-algorithms for the minimization of MAP energies which arise in the context of any observation system giving rise to a convex data-fidelity term and of Markov random field (MRF) energies involving any nonconvex and/or nonsmooth PFs. As a side-result, we propose how to construct pertinent initializations which allow us to obtain meaningful solutions using local minimization of these MAP energies.

In addition, it was found that the system could effectively detect correlations in images under public key attacks by using additionally issued public keys for verification.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-0150-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174700","Asymmetric;Correlation Detection;Private key & Public key;Public key Attack","Conferences;Correlation;Equations;Matrix decomposition;Public key;Transform coding;Watermarking","image watermarking;public key cryptography","asymmetric watermarking;image watermarking;linear transformation;public key attack detection;public key attack verification","","0","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first demonstrate the handoff performance under nontrivial node mobility. Simulations show that our handoff scheme provides practically equivalent results as the benchmark with no handoff, which indicates that our scheme is quite resistant to node mobility. Next we investigate the general handoff problems where each node can possess multiple radios and nodes are randomly dispersed in some region. In this case, the network topology forms a multi-linked graph (multigraph). By converting the multigraph to simple graphs, our extensive simulations show that our scheme can render low latency, low overhead handoff with minimum packet loss. Finally, we study the synergies with IEEE 802.21 and describe how to integrate IEEE 802.21 into our multi-layer architecture.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455118","","Automation;Bandwidth;Costs;Delay;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network interfaces;Paper technology;Switches;Wireless networks","","","","2","1","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work shows that the short pulse case can be treated as the superposition of dark-state polaritons and simultons. The propagation velocity of simulton is proportional to the intensity of probe pulses with Rabi frequencies (interacting with the ground state). The propagation velocity of polariton is proportional to more intensive coupling pulses (resonant to adjacent transitions) with equal Rabi frequencies. Simultons propagate slowly and become detached in space. Segregated polariton component acts as matched pulses.

In fact, more organizations have found out that retention of their present customers, as their most valuable asset, is very important. Therefore, with the aim of describing data mining abilities in churn management, and designing and implementation of a customer churn prediction model using a standard CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and random forest technique, the database of one of the biggest holdings of the country, Solico food industries group, is explored.

Recently, many flooding schemes have been studied to avoid the problems of severe redundancies, contentions, and collisions in traditional implementations. One of the recent efficient approaches is 1HI by Liu et aL, which uses only 1-hop neighbor information. The advantage of this scheme is that it achieves local optimality in term of the number of retransmitting nodes with the time complexity O(nlogn), although considerable redundant transmissions still remain. In this paper, we present a novel flooding algorithm to efficiently reduce the number of retransmitting nodes and to solve the broadcast storm problem in ad hoc networks by using our proposed concept of ""2-hop backward information."" The most important feature of the proposed algorithm is that it does not require any extra communication overhead other than the exchanging of broadcast storm problem, while maintaining the high deliverability. Comprehensive simulations are performed to show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the redundant transmissions in 1HI and pure flooding; accordingly it alleviates the contentions and collisions in networks.","","978-1-4244-2075-9","978-1-4244-2075-9","10.1109/ICC.2008.464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4533500","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Communication system control;Communications Society;Floods;Mobile radio mobility management;Peer to peer computing;Redundancy;Routing protocols;Storms","ad hoc networks;computational complexity;routing protocols;telecommunication congestion control","2-hop backward information;ad hoc network routing protocol;broadcast storm problem;control message propagation;flooding scheme;network collision;time complexity","","8","","","","","19-23 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows one to avoid multiple zero crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load condition, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the <i>d</i>-axis, while the <i>d</i>-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under a load condition, the injection voltage is switched to the <i>q</i>-axis, while the <i>d</i> -axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance in a region of ZCC without a predefined offline commissioning test than the standard pulsating injection scheme. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing the estimation error caused by the ZCC disturbance and in extending the system bandwidth.","0093-9994","","","10.1109/TIA.2008.2006350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681946","Estimated position error and velocity ripple;injection-based axis switching (IAS) sensorless control;pulsating high-frequency (HF) signal injection;zero-current-clamping (ZCC) effect","Amplitude estimation;Clamps;Current measurement;Error correction;Estimation error;Hafnium;Permanent magnet motors;Sensorless control;Voltage control;Zero voltage switching","electric current control;machine control;permanent magnet motors","amplitude-modulated pattern;axis switching sensorless control;current phase angle;minimal zero-current clamping effects;position detection error;pulsating carrier-signal voltage;pulsating high- frequency signal;pulsating signal injection;standard pulsating injection scheme;stationary reference frame;surface-mounted permanent-magnet motors;synchronous frame;velocity estimation ripple","","16","1","11","","","Nov.-dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The paper describes the relevant issues for interoperability and suggests solutions where they currently exist. It further summarizes the work which needs to be done for a complete solution and the groups who are involved in achieving this goal.

Instead of trying to find more circles to cover the area, we modify the theory to fit our requirement. In second model for the case of 10,000 simultaneous users, we noticed the fact that hexagon is considered to be the optimal graphic which uses the least nodes to cover the maximum area. In this case, we model the repeater cover regions by several regular hexagons. The key point in this case is to calculate the area of intersection. Recognized the complexity of direct calculation, we follow the idea of the Monte Carlo method.","","978-1-4673-0721-5","","10.1109/CSSS.2012.279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394517","distribution;monte carlo;wireless networks","Load modeling;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Monte Carlo methods;Receivers;Repeaters;Wireless communication","Monte Carlo methods;repeaters;wireless sensor networks","Monte Carlo method;circles covering circles;repeater distribution;wireless senor networks","","0","","3","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method, which is based on the concept of adaptive notch filter (ANF), adaptively decomposes the measured power signal into its constituting components independent of where their frequencies are located. The algorithm provides instantaneous values of the various estimated frequency components in addition to the values of their frequencies, amplitudes, and phase angles. The structure and mathematical formulation of the proposed technique, including guidelines for its parameter tuning, are presented and its performance is studied in a variety of scenarios where the power signal attributes, such as fundamental frequency and amplitude, undergo variations over time. This study confirms the desirable transient and steady-state performances of the proposed method. Compared with its recently proposed counterpart, the proposed method of this paper obviates the need for using a phase-locked loop (PLL), and hence, offers a more simplified structure which makes it more attractive from an implementation point of view.","0885-8977","","","10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2036624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5427011","Adaptive notch filter;harmonics detection and extraction;harmonics measurement;interharmonics;power signal analysis","","active filters;notch filters;phase locked loops;power system harmonics","adaptive notch filter;harmonic component detection;harmonic component extraction;harmonics measurement;interharmonic component detection;interharmonic component extraction;phase-locked loop;power signal analysis","","17","","18","","2010-03-08","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We first define the simplified RC circuit model of a hybrid clock mesh/tree structure. The skew reduction effect of shunt segment contributed by the mesh is derived analytically from the simplified model. The result indicates that the skew decreases proportionally to the exponential of -R<sub>1</sub>/R, where R<sub>1</sub> is the driving resistance of a leaf node in the clock tree and R is the resistance of a mesh segment. Based on our analysis, we propose a hybrid multilevel mesh and tree structure for global clock distribution. A simple optimization scheme is adopted to optimize the routing resource distribution of the multilevel mesh. Experimental results show that by adding a mesh to the bottom-level leaves of an H-tree, the clock skew can be reduced from 29.2 ps to 8.7 ps, and the multilevel networks with same total routing area can further reduce the clock skew by another 30%. We also discuss the inductive effect of mesh in the appendix. When the clock frequency is less than 4 GHz, our RC model remains valid for clock meshes with grounded shielding or using differential signals.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337577","","Circuits;Clocks;Computer science;Delay;Frequency;Microprocessors;Minimization;Registers;Routing;Tree data structures","RC circuits;clocks;minimisation","RC circuit model;clock skew minimization;hybrid clock mesh structure;leaf node;multilevel clock distribution network;optimization scheme;routing resource distribution;tree structure","","13","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20020806","1999","2","","1258","1261 vol.2","The equivalence theorem provides an elegant method for analysing electromagnetic radiation and scattering from structures. A specific class of problems is where a source is enclosed within a structure which forms a cavity with an aperture. From a radiation point of view, the fields within the cavity are not of any real interest, only the 'external' fields radiated from the aperture. If the field distribution in the aperture is known (even if only approximately), this a priori knowledge can be exploited to limit calculations to the 'external' part of the problem. This technique is commonly referred to as 'aperture theory'. This paper deals with the methods in which the equivalent aperture current densities are incorporated into the surface equivalence theorem. It is shown that the application of image theory to problems involving radiation from apertures in a half-space is incorrect and that the conventional formulation of aperture theory violates a basic condition of the equivalence principle. A new aperture theory formulation is presented. The method is very simple to implement and is shown to be exact in as far as the exact aperture fields are known.","","0-7803-5639-x","","10.1109/APS.1999.789542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=789542","","Antenna theory;Aperture antennas;Conductors;Current density;Electromagnetic analysis;Electromagnetic radiation;Electromagnetic scattering;Integral equations;Magnetic fields;Moment methods","current density;electromagnetic fields;electromagnetic wave scattering","aperture;aperture fields;aperture radiation;aperture theory;cavity;electric field;electromagnetic radiation;electromagnetic scattering;equivalent aperture current densities;external radiated fields;field distribution;half-space;image theory;magnetic field;surface equivalence theorem","","2","","4","","","11-16 July 1999","11 Jul 1999-16 Jul 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the interpretation of measurement results, detailed knowledge of the current distribution is highly desired. We present a review of current unbalance measurements and current distribution reconstruction techniques in CICC as they were intensively performed during the last years. The experimental methods of current unbalance detection are described, starting with earlier attempts on sub-size CICCs and ending with more sophisticated methods on full-size conductors. The models of current identification developed by various research groups are briefly compared, emphasizing their similarities, differences and limitations.

Seventh International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","417","424","An embedded real-time system consists of a number of components (processes) that run concurrently and communicate with each other under predefined timing constraints. The correctness of such systems is important, since they are used in an increasingly number of safety-critical systems. To improve the quality of these systems, two techniques can be used, namely verification of the specification and testing of the implementation. In this paper, we consider the testing of embedded real-time components. In our model, the system is modeled as a set of communicating timed input-output automata (CTIOA). One CTIOA specifies the component to be tested and the remaining CTIOAs represent the context. The relationship between the component to be tested and the other ones should be taken into account for test case generation. We discuss how testing in context differs from testing in isolation. We review the fault model in the context of CTIOA and we propose an approach for test case generation from an embedded CTIOA. This approach consists of three steps. First, we avoid the composition of all machines by selecting, based on a specific criterion, only some parts of the CTIOA's context that affect (or are affected by) the specification. Then we determine the partial product of the specification and the selected parts of the context. Finally, we apply the timed Wp-method (A. En-Nouaary et al., 1998) to the resulting timed input-output automata.

(KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany","Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), 2011 International Conference on","20111110","2011","","","1","6","In this paper a tightly coupled UWB/INS system for pedestrian indoor applications is presented. In indoor environments wireless signal outage and severe multipath propagation very often lead to ranging errors and make pure UWB-based localization barely possible. On the other hand inertial sensor based systems (INS) are known for their drift with time. The integration of those two systems will allow to profit from their advantages. For the sensor data fusion the tightly coupled approach and integrity monitoring are crucial factors for a robust implementation. One possibility is the Time of Arrival (ToA) approach where the user clock bias and drift are modeled and estimated in the navigation filter. The other possibility is the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) approach, where the range measurements are differenced totally eliminating the clock error. If user/transmitter clocks do not follow the clock drift model very well, it is better to apply the TDoA approach. For time of arrival applications, innovation based integrity monitoring is standard. However for the use of Time Difference of Arrival measurements (TDoA) in this paper an Innovation Based Integrity Monitoring (IBIM) method is presented.

The main differential point with regard to other structures used in the past consists of the connection of neutral wire to negative of DC bus in the inverter, thus avoiding the need of split capacitors at the DC bus. The LC coupling and a particular control of the DC voltage at the coupling C allow the use of low voltage at the DC bus and provide a symmetry of available voltage, in the current controller, during t<sub>on</sub> and t<sub>off</sub>. The paper includes a general discussion of the new structure, comparing it with the classical L coupled shunt APFs and presents the control method to obtain the above mentioned voltage symmetry, which allows lower DC bus voltage and lower values of coupling L. Simulation and experimental results are given to show the behavior of the system, used for harmonics cancellation.","","978-92-75815-10-8","978-92-75815-10-8","10.1109/EPE.2007.4417626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417626","Active filter;Power conditioning;Three-phase system","Active filters;Capacitors;Inverters;Leg;Power harmonic filters;Power system harmonics;Reactive power;Topology;Voltage control;Wires","active filters;power harmonic filters","DC bus;LC coupled shunt active power filter;LC coupling;active filter;harmonics cancellation;neutral wire;power conditioning","","0","","19","","","2-5 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Div., Univ. of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2013 IEEE 54th Annual Symposium on","20131219","2013","","","263","269","We introduce a new approach to the maximum flow problem in undirected, capacitated graphs using congestion-approximators: easy-to-compute functions that approximate the congestion required to route single-commodity demands in a graph to within some factor α. Our algorithm maintains an arbitrary flow that may have some residual excess and deficits, while taking steps to minimize a potential function measuring the congestion of the current flow plus an over-estimate of the congestion required to route the residual demand. Since the residual term over-estimates, the descent process gradually moves the contribution to our potential function from the residual term to the congestion term, eventually achieving a flow routing the desired demands with nearly minimal congestion after Õ(α<sup>2</sup>ε<sup>-2</sup> log<sup>2</sup> n) iterations. Our approach is similar in spirit to that used by Spielman and Teng (STOC 2004) for solving Laplacian systems, and we summarize our approach as trying to do for ℓ<sub>∞</sub>-flows what they do for ℓ<sub>∞</sub>-flows. Together with a nearly linear time construction of a no(1)-congestion-approximator, we obtain 1 + ε-optimal singlecommodity flows undirected graphs in time m<sup>1+o</sup>(1)ε<sup>-2</sup>, yielding the fastest known algorithm for that problem. Our requirements of a congestion-approximator are quite low, suggesting even faster and simpler algorithms for certain classes of graphs. For example, an α-competitive oblivious routing tree meets our definition, even without knowing how to route the tree back in the graph. For graphs of conductance φ, a trivial φ<sup>-1</sup>-congestionapproximator gives an extremely simple algorithm for finding Õ(mφ<sup>-1</sup>).","0272-5428","","","10.1109/FOCS.2013.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686162","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Equations;Laplace equations;Routing;Vectors;Vegetation","computational complexity;graph theory;iterative methods;optimisation","α-competitive oblivious routing tree;Laplacian system;congestion-approximators;descent process;flow congestion;flow routing;function minimization;graph conductance;iteration;maximum flow problem;nearly linear time construction;nearly maximum flows;nearly minimal congestion;optimal single-commodity flow undirected graph;residual demand;residual excess;single-commodity demand routing;undirected capacitated graph","","2","","13","","","26-29 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bondability to pads with various layers of residue was evaluated by visual inspection of the bonds, by pull-testing the bonds, and by measuring the electrical resistance of the bonds. Reliability was evaluated by monitoring electrical resistance of the bonds as a function of bake-time. It was discovered that bonds to under-etched pads do not stick and have low reliability.

It uses all available multispectral information, by adding the magnitudes and directions of edges derived from edge detection in single bands, instead of just taking the maximum, which is commonly done. The addition is weighted on the edge direction, to remove noise and enhance the “major direction”. The resulting image is then thinned using magnitude and direction information, together with hysteresis thresholding, so that weak edges can be preserved without adding too much noise. Small gaps in the edges are filled in. All edges between areas with different spectral characteristics are detected. The same technique could also be used for edge detection in multi-temporal images, or even multi-temporal/multispectral images.

Thus, studying the performance of BD under imperfect CSI is crucial for a practical system design since the robustness of BD to real-world imperfections should be verified. In this paper we apply a first-order perturbation analysis of the SVD to derive analytic expressions of the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for each subchannel of each UT using BD in presence of imperfect CSI. To demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions, a robust BD technique via worst SINR maximization is developed.

In this paper, the fast flow graph and recursive equations for the FPQLI transform are given together with the underlying basis functions. Formulae for converting the FPQLI spectral coefficient vector from one polarity to another are also given and used to generate a recursive algorithm to obtain the optimal FPQLI expansion with reduced computational cost. Experimental results of the FPQLI transform have been obtained for a set of quaternary test files.

Although scalable, its coded bit stream is not fully embedded. In the paper, we provide an embedded SLCCA, which improves our previous work on embedded SLCCA. Like, we define a base layer and an enhancement layer for an image. The base layer encoded by SLCCA provides an acceptable image quality while achieving high coding efficiency and scalability. The enhancement layer provides more elaborate bit-rate adaptive granular picture quality enhancement for embedded image coding.

Rather than focusing on the statistical differences between the image textures, we recognize that images from digital cameras contain traces of resampling as a result of using a color filter array with demosaicing algorithms. We recognize that estimation of the actual demosaicing parameters is not necessary; rather, detection of the presence of demosaicing is the key. The in-camera processing (rather than the image content) distinguishes the digital camera photographs from computer graphics.

Also, the power required for the tracking motor has to be provided by the solar panel and the battery system. Although better performance is achievable by the sun tracker, higher cost and frequent maintenance are required. In this paper, performance enhancement of solar panels has been experimented utilizing diffused reflectors. Application of diffused reflectors is cheap, simple and does not require any additional equipments or devices. Simple white reflectors can be used to optimize the performance of the solar panel. Experimental results indicate appreciable enhancement in the overall output of the solar panel. For comparative study, experimental readings were simultaneously taken with i) sun tracking, ii) the panel aligned at 23.5?? with the horizontal using diffused reflectors and iii) the panel aligned at 23.5?? with the horizontal without diffused reflectors.

Dimensionality reduction techniques have been widely used to produce visual representation of document collections. Focusing on multidimensional projection techniques, good visual results are produced depending on how representative terms to discriminate the documents are chosen to compose the vector space model (VSM). To define a good VSM it is necessary to apply filters during the preprocessing in order to eliminate terms using their frequency. For that, the user must evaluate the term frequency histogram based on his/her expertise in the text subject and decide the threshold value for frequency cut. Usually it is a trial and error approach that requires the user to verify the quality of visual representation after each trial. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach that applies the Otsu's Threshold Selection Method for computing a threshold using a term frequency histogram. We conducted experiments that have shown our approach generates visual representations as good as those generated with a threshold obtained by trial and error approach. The contribution of our approach is that users with non expertise are able to generate good visual representations and the time to get a good threshold is decreased.","1550-6037","","","10.1109/IV.2013.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676566","Otsu's Threshold Selection Method;Term Frequency Thresholding;Vector Space Model Computation;Visual Text Mining","","data mining;data visualisation;text analysis","Otsu threshold selection method;dimensionality reduction techniques;document collections;multidimensional projection techniques;term frequency histogram;textual data exploration;vector space model computation;visual representations;visualization techniques","","0","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Confirming ideas originally due to Hall (1970), we demonstrate that geometric embeddings of the circuit netlist can lead to high-quality k-way partitionings. The netlist embeddings are derived via the computation of d eigenvectors of the Laplacian for a graph representation of the netlist. As Hall did not specify how to partition such geometric embeddings, we explore various geometric partitioning objectives and algorithms, and find that they are limited because they do not integrate topological information from the netlist. Thus, we also present a new partitioning algorithm that exploits both the geometric embedding and netlist information, as well as a restricted partitioning formulation that requires each cluster of the k-way partitioning to be contiguous in a given linear ordering. We begin with a d-dimensional spectral embedding and construct a heuristic 1-dimensional ordering of the modules (combining spacefilling curve with 3-Opt approaches originally proposed for the traveling salesman problem). We then apply dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal k-way split of the ordering for a variety of objective functions, including Scaled Cost and Absorption. This approach can transparently integrate user-specified cluster size bounds.

Timing recovery is one of the key technologies for these systems to work effectively. In this paper, an efficiently iterative timing recovery with Turbo decoding is presented. By maximizing the sum of the square of soft decision metrics from Turbo decoding, it can obtain accurate timing acquisition. And a computation-efficient approximate gradient descent method is adopted to obtain rough estimate of timing offset. Another merit of it is that, by the proposed method, a rate-1/6 Turbo coded binary phase shift keying (BPSK) system can even work at very low SNR (E<sub>s</sub>/N<sub>0</sub>) about -7.44 dB without any pilot symbol. Finally, the whole timing recovery scheme is accomplished where the proposed method is combined with Mueller-Muller (M&M) timing recovery which performs the timing track. Simulation results indicate that the Turbo coded BPSK system with rather large timing errors by the proposed scheme can achieve performance within 0.1 dB of the ideal code with reasonable computations and storages.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0989-9","978-1-4673-0988-2","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6239851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6239851","","Approximation algorithms;Binary phase shift keying;Decoding;Iterative decoding;Timing;Turbo codes","iterative decoding;space communication links;synchronisation;turbo codes","Mueller-Muller timing recovery;SNR;Shannon limit channel codes;computation-efficient approximate gradient descent method;iterative timing recovery;low signal-to-noise rate;soft decision metrics;space communication systems;turbo codes;turbo decoding","","0","","12","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we borrow ideas of object typicality from cognitive psychology and propose a novel typicality-based collaborative filtering recommendation method named TyCo. A distinct feature of typicality-based CF is that it finds ""neighbors"" of users based on user typicality degrees in user groups (instead of the corated items of users, or common users of items, as in traditional CF). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on investigating CF recommendation by combining object typicality. TyCo outperforms many CF recommendation methods on recommendation accuracy (in terms of MAE) with an improvement of at least 6.35 percent in Movielens data set, especially with sparse training data (9.89 percent improvement on MAE) and has lower time cost than other CF methods. Further, it can obtain more accurate predictions with less number of big-error predictions.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407132","Recommendation;collaborative filtering;typicality","Collaboration;Educational institutions;Motion pictures;Prototypes;Recommender systems;Vectors","collaborative filtering;recommender systems","CF methods;TyCo method;big-error predictions;cognitive psychology;object typicality;recommendation accuracy;recommender systems;typicality-based collaborative filtering recommendation method;user typicality degrees","","3","","45","","2013-01-08","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With their unique architecture, these composite web services can be partitioned and orchestrated in a decentralized fashion on a distributed infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate how different topologies generated by decentralized orchestration are affected differently by variations in WAN conditions. We present a system that exploits this and adapts to changes in WAN conditions. The system monitors the availability of network bandwidth, evaluates its effect on the performance of each topology using a performance model based on bandwidth availability, and then selects the optimal topology at runtime.

The background of TIM theory is the ""dilemma of technology innovation"" in most Chinese corporations. In order to solve the difficult technology innovation related problem and on base of case study and theory analysis, RCID puts forward that technology innovation management should be a TIM pattern in current competitive circumstances. It suggests that the successful technology innovation should be an activity including all the technological factors and all the non-technology factors related. Based on the case study of successful experience of Chinese Haier group, this paper will provide theoretical and realistic evidences for TIM theory and give companies (especially manufacturing factories) some suggestions to get good innovation performance. In this paper, we also stresses that development of individual innovative ability is the key factor in company development. It will provide some evidences for the ""people-oriented"" management. This paper will show that the key to great performance gained by Haier is ""everyone as innovator"" with its management & operating mechanism. ""Everyone as innovator"" means all the employees of Haier should promote their individual ability, and at the same time, helps to form an innovative culture climate permeable all over the company. Then the culture climate fuses successfully all the Haier's TIM elements including strategy innovation, management innovation, institution innovation, market innovation and technology innovation into a whole. According to theory of ""field"" effect, we analyzed the role of innovative culture and presented the concept of ""cultural field"" effect.

The focus is mainly set on linear controllers such as proportional-integral, proportional-resonant, and deadbeat (DB) controllers. Additionally, an improved DB controller robust against grid impedance variation is also presented. Since the paper discusses the implementation of these controllers for grid-connected applications, their evaluation is made in three operating conditions. First, in steady-state conditions, the contribution of controllers to the total harmonic distortion of the grid current is pursued. Further on, the behavior of controllers in the case of transient conditions like input power variations and grid voltage faults is also examined. Experimental results in each case are presented in order to evaluate the performance of the controllers.","0885-8993","","","10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4801680","Current controllers;current harmonic distortion;distributed power generation systems (DPGSs);grid faults;input power variations","","PI control;distributed power generation;electric current control;power generation control;power grids","current controllers;deadbeat controllers;grid current;grid impedance variation;grid-connected distributed power generation systems;linear controllers;photovoltaic systems;proportional-integral controllers;proportional-resonant controllers;wind turbines","","187","1","36","","2009-03-16","March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ICSE 2002. Proceedings of the 24rd International Conference on","20050523","2002","","","717","","Summary form only given. Proposes an architecture-driven design approach based on the concept of proto-frameworks, aiming to provide an intermediate stage in the transition from architectural models to object-oriented frameworks or applications. The approach relies on an object-oriented materialization of domain-specific architectures derived from domain models, i.e. the production of concrete computational representations of abstract architectural descriptions using object-oriented terminology. A proto-framework materializes, in object-oriented terms, the infrastructure required for cooperation and communication of each architectural component type. The framework gives abstract hooks to map specific domain components into a class hierarchy in a white-box fashion. This mapping can produce a specific application, but it can also produce new domain-specific frameworks that adopt the underlying architectural model. In the proposed approach, we can basically identify two stages. First, developers should figure out the problem architecture; aspects are initially mapped to architectural constructs, instead of being coded using framework language constructs. Second, the approach enables a materialization into a proto-framework, and then several kinds of frameworks implementations. These frameworks retain the properties inherited from the original architecture.","","1-58113-472-X","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008052","","Assembly systems;Bridges;Computer architecture;Concrete;Context modeling;Distributed computing;Documentation;Object oriented modeling;Permission;Production","inheritance;object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software architecture","abstract architectural descriptions;architectural component types;architectural models;aspect-oriented programming;class hierarchy;computational representations;domain models;domain-specific architectures;inheritance;object-oriented bridge;object-oriented frameworks;object-oriented materialization;object-oriented terminology;proto-frameworks;software architectural styles;software architecture-driven design approach","","0","","","","","25-25 May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, news articles are added and updated round-the-clock. News retrieval systems which are in use today, are not very much capable of handling such huge amounts of news articles effectively and accurately. Due to the need for frequent and intensive processing, a news retrieval system needs to be scalable, robust and fault tolerant. By the use of Cloud technology, this can achieved. A news retrieval system on the cloud can be used to fetch, process, organize and also be used for faster and accurate retrieval. It can be made to operate with less supervision or none at all. Cloud Press, a next generation news retrieval system presented here, is designed and implemented, to overcome most of the pit falls of the news retrieval systems, which are in place today. It uses MapReduce paradigm for fetching, processing and organizing all the news articles in a distributed fashion. MapReduce approach allows it to split the tasks into sub-tasks and then allows them to be assigned to various nodes present in the cloud, which are then finished and consolidated to give one final output. Thus, the processing speed is increased and the processing time is reduced, greatly. Cloud Press uses various novel algorithms for parallel crawling of the web and distributed processing of the news articles. A distributed database is used for storing and indexing of news articles. The retrieval system also includes a query expansion feature for searching of news articles and a novel visualization technique is used to visualize the retrieved news articles.","","978-1-4673-0252-4","","10.1109/RACSS.2012.6212684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212684","Distributed systems;Information visualization;Parallel algorithms;Retrieval models","Crawlers;Distributed databases;Generators;Indexes;Three dimensional displays;Visualization;XML","Internet;cloud computing;data visualisation;electronic publishing;indexing;query processing","Internet;MapReduce paradigm;cloud press;cloud technology;distributed processing;news article indexing;news articles;next generation news retrieval system;parallel Web crawling;retrieved news articles;visualization technique","","2","","7","","","25-27 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decision support systems, cardiac event recorders and digital signal transmission systems were thus intensively investigated over the last decade. The EPI-MEDICS project has designed an intelligent, portable personal ECG monitor (PEM) that is able to record and to analyse a 3-lead SCP-ECG compliant electrocardiogram (ECG), and to synthesize the missing standard ECG leads by means of advanced neural network-based methods. In addition, the PEM device embeds decision-making methods taking into account the ECG analysis results, the patient risk factors and clinical data, and have the capability of generating different levels of alarms that are transmitted to the relevant health care providers by means of a standard Bluetooth-enabled, GSM/GPRS-compatible mobile phone. In this paper, we present strategies for the implementation and the deployment of patient/citizen specific neural network-based methods used for the synthesis and interpretation of the patients ECGs by means of an ad hoc infrastructure that allows neural learning on a large scale, thanks to Web services and grid computing technologies. The proposed solution is open, generic and adaptable to any standard SCP-ECG compliant portable electrocardiograph or PEM device from the EPI-MEDICS project.

The coating technique comprised alternating layers of drug-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelles and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) held together by hydrogen bonding interaction. The sustained release kinetics of chlorophene from the coated catheter surface was achieved by crosslinking PAA with ethylenediamine. The coating and crosslinking were confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. In addition, the polymeric micelles were also fluorescently labeled in order to quantify their release by spectrofluorometry method. FTIR spectra of the coated catheters showed strong carbonyl absorption of both PCL (1736 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and PAA (1708 cm<sup>-1</sup>) while the crosslinked ones revealed additional amide I (1643 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and amide II (1548 cm<sup>-1</sup>) absorption bands which confirmed successful crosslinking of the PAA layers. Comparing to the non-crosslinked catheters, the crosslinked ones displayed a more sustained release of micelles over 30 days. Such release behavior is more favorable for the extended prevention against bacterial infection associated with the clinical use of catheters.","1944-9399","978-1-4673-2198-3","","10.1109/NANO.2012.6403799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403799","antibacterial;catheter;crosslinking;polymeric micelle;sustained release","Anti-bacterial;Catheters;Coatings;Fluorescence;Hydrogen;Polymers","Fourier transform spectra;attenuated total reflection;biotechnology;catheters;colloids;dip coating;drugs;hydrogen bonds;infrared spectra;polymer films;silicone rubber","ATR-FTIR spectroscopy;FTIR spectra;PEG-b-PCL micelles;absorption bands;amide I;amide II;bacterial infection;carbonyl absorption;chlorophene;chlorophene-loaded polymeric micelles;crosslinking PAA;drug-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) micelles;ethylenediamine;hydrogen bonding interaction;layer-by-layer nanocoating;nanostructured LBL dip coating method;nanostructured layer-by-layer dip coating method;poly(acrylic acid);silicone catheters;spectrofluorometry method;urinary tract infection prevention","","0","","11","","","20-23 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some applications require the existence of a communication backbone federating different OWSN sectors, in order to collaborate in achieving more sophisticated missions. Federating (connecting) these sectors is an intricate task due to the huge distances between them, and due to the harsh operational conditions. A natural choice in this case is to have multiple Relay Nodes (RNs) that provide vast coverage and sustain the network connectivity in harsh environments. However, these RNs are not cheap and, thus, a constraint on their count holds. That being said and considering the harsh conditions in outdoor environments, placement of the RNs becomes crucial and has to be in a way that tolerates failures in communication links and deployed nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in optimizing the RNs placement, called ST-DT approach, with the objective of federating different OWSNs with the maximum connectivity under a cost constraint on the RNs count to be deployed. The performance of the proposed approach is validated and assessed through extensive simulations and comparisons assuming practical considerations in large-scale outdoor environments.","1525-3511","978-1-4673-0436-8","","10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214092","Cost;Federated OWSN;Harsh environments;Outdoor Wireless Sensor Network (OWSN);Relays placement","Joining processes;Optimization;Relays;Steiner trees;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks","augmented connectivity;communication links;federated wireless sensor networks;harsh environments;multiple relay nodes;network connectivity;outdoor wireless sensor network;wireless communication","","2","","17","","","1-4 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Low temperature fine pitch Flex-on-Flex (FOF) assembly using nanofiber Sn58Bi solder anisotropic conductive films (ACFs) and ultrasonic bonding method","Tae Wan Kim; Kyung-lim Suk; Kyung-Wook Paik","Dept. of Mater.

However, as the electronic devices became more advanced, the electrode pitch size became extremely smaller. This miniaturization resulted in more complicated interconnection problems such as short circuit and open circuit. And in most ACF bonding process, high bonding temperature is necessary for full ACF resin curing and stable electrical joint formation. Therefore, lowering the bonding temperature is more desirable for reducing damages, increasing productivity and most importantly lowering the process cost. As a result, low temperature conductive particle incorporated nanofiber Sn58Bi solder ACFs were introduced in order to increase the reliability and productivity while preventing any interconnection problems in fine pitch assembly. In this study, nanofiber Sn58Bi solder ACFs using low melting temperature Sn58Bi solder particles were investigated with respect to electrical/mechanical properties and reliability. Nanofiber solder ACFs are composed of polymer adhesive resin and conductive particle incorporated nanofibers. In order to lower the bonding temperature below 200 °C, we use Sn58Bi (42 % Sn and 58 % Bi) solder particles with a low melting temperature of 138 °C. The conductive particles were incorporated with variety of polymers such as PAN, and PVDF nanofibers by using a technique called “electro-spinning”. The nanofiber solder layer with a thickness below 30 μm was then laminated between two non-conductive films (NCFs) through roll and vacuum lamination to produce nanofiber Sn58Bi solder ACFs. As for FOF bonding, ultrasonic bonding method was used to remove solder oxides while reducing the bonding times. As a result, by incorporating low melting temperature Sn58Bi solder particle, 1- 0μm fine pitch FOF bonding was successfully performed below 200°C with stable contact resistance and joint formation. And incorporated solder particles with nanofiber showed excellent insulation effects which eventually prevents short circuit between neighboring electrodes in FPCs.","0569-5503","978-1-4799-0233-0","","10.1109/ECTC.2013.6575612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575612","","Bonding;Electrodes;Insulation;Joints;Nickel;Polymers;Resins","adhesive bonding;anisotropic media;assembling;bismuth alloys;conducting polymers;conductive adhesives;electrospinning;interconnections;melting;nanofibres;reliability;resins;solders;tin alloys","ACF bonding process;ACF resin;SnBi;adhesive polymer resin;bonding temperature;electrical joint formation;electrical properties;electrode pitch size;electronic devices manufacturing;electrospinning;fine pitch capability;insulation effects;interconnection problems;low temperature fine pitch FOF assembly;low temperature fine pitch flex-on-flex assembly;mechanical properties;melting temperature solder particles;nanofiber solder ACF;nanofiber solder anisotropic conductive films;nanofiber solder layer;nonconductive films through roll;productivity;size 100 mum;size 30 mum;temperature 138 degC;temperature conductive particle incorporated nanofiber solder ACFs;ultrasonic bonding method;vacuum lamination","","1","","4","","","28-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, the user's performance becomes susceptible to slower response times, loss of situational awareness, faulty decision making, and execution errors. Researchers and designers have responded to these issues with the development and application of multimodal information displays. The cross-disciplinary flavor of multimodal applications presents a challenge to the accumulation, evaluation, and dissemination of relevant research.

Online learning environments no longer depend on homogeneous groups, static content and resources, and single pedagogies, but high customization and flexibility are a must in this context. As a result, current educational organizationspsila needs involve extending and moving to highly customized learning and teaching forms in timely fashion, each incorporating its own pedagogical approach, each targeting a specific learning goal, and each incorporating its specific resources. Moreover, organizationspsila demands include a cost-effective integration of legacy and separated learning systems, from different institutions, departments and courses, which are implemented in different languages, supported by heterogeneous platforms and distributed everywhere, to name some of them. Therefore, e-learning applications need to be developed in a way that overcome these demanding requirements as well as provide educational organizations with fast, flexible and effective solutions for the enhancement and improvement of the learning performance and outcomes. To this end, in this paper, an innovative engineering software technique is introduced that combines the generic programming paradigm and service-oriented architectures in the form of Web-services for the effective and timely construction of flexible, scalable, interoperable and robust applications as key aspects to address the current demanding and changing requirements in software development in general and specifically in the e-learning domain.

In examining these performance issues of VLIW systems, we consider Intel first 64-bit architecture, the IA-64, and its first implementation, the Itanium, which employs Intel version of VLIW. We present a comprehensive analysis of the problem of under-utilization due to nops and stops across a wide range of application domains through the use of three different benchmark suites: SPEC CPU 2000, MediaBench, and PacketBench. Our results show that, on average, nops create an under-utilization factor of 28.46% in the case of SPEC CPU, 32.27% in MediaBench, and 29.76% in PacketBench.

Using the embedded ad-hoc networking mechanism, nodes are able to transport packets across the network in a multihop fashion. An embedded mobile backbone is dynamically constructed to form a 2-level physical heterogeneous multihop wireless network. These backbone nodes provide two critical functions: (1) direct communication between neighboring cluster heads; and (2) efficient route discovery in HSR. With the broadcast feature of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the link state can be broadcast to backbone nodes instead of “flooding” on the level 2.

A set of mathematical expressions (i.e. the conditional functions) for dynamic testing is described. The main characteristics, the main substances studied and the areas of application are presented. Since the performance of testing systems in implantation dynamic testing are strongly affected by the environment forces, general calibration methods are virtually not applicable.

Users of network nodes, e.g. mobile phones, would like their individual devices to be operational for as long as possible. On the other hand, users and operators of wireless networks may wish for an overall long network lifetime via collaborative node operations. In contrast to the most of the work done till now, in this paper, we consider a node-centric scenario, where a node can balance its energy consumption according to its needs to prolong the node lifetime. More specifically, the energy balancing problem is defined as an inventory control problem, where the node may choose to be selfish or unselfish with various degrees having in mind a range of parameters, such as its battery state and the existence and rate of energy harvesting. Each node can use the proposed solution to allocate the available energy between internal (node itself) and external (collaborative) tasks subject to dependencies among application and communication layers and the node operating system. We also discuss a number of other possible extensions of the method to include interactions among different nodes in the network. To illustrate one such an extension, a case study with a large number of nodes among two separate but co-located wireless mesh networks is presented. By applying the inventory balancing algorithm, considerable increase in the network lifetime is shown for both networks.","","","","10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6962223","","Batteries;Collaboration;Inventory control;Optimization;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","energy harvesting;power consumption;telecommunication power management;wireless mesh networks","co-located wireless mesh networks;energy consumption;energy harvesting;inventory balancing algorithm;inventory control problem;mobile phones;network lifetime;network nodes;node-centric energy balancing;node-centric scenario;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study used a tensor field sampled from a full-brain diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) dataset. The independent variables include illumination model (global illumination and OpenGL-style local illumination), texture (with and without), motion (with and without), and task. The three spatial analysis tasks are: (1) a depth-judgment task: determining which of two marked tubes is closer to the user's viewpoint, (2) a visual-tracing task: marking the endpoint of a tube, and (3) a contact-judgment task: analyzing tube-sphere penetration. Our results indicate that global illumination did not improve task completion time for the tasks we measured. Global illumination reduced the errors in participants' answers over local OpenGLstyle rendering for the visual-tracing task only when motion was present. Motion contributed to spatial understanding for all tasks, but at the cost of longer task completion time. A high-frequency texture pattern led to longer task completion times and higher error rates.

While sensors are typically deployed in abundance to tolerate possible node failures, a large number of such failures within the same region simultaneously may result in losing the connectivity with the sink node which eventually reduces the quality and efficiency of the network operation. Given that WSNs are deployed in inhospitable environments, such multiple node failures are very likely due to storms, fires, floods, etc. To recover from these multiple node failures, in this paper, we first present a local partition detection algorithm which makes the sensors aware of the damage and thus the partitioning in the network. We then utilize this information to recover the paths by exploiting sensor mobility. The idea is to locate the failed nodes by keeping complete routing information from each sensor to the sink node and move some of the sensors to such locations to re-establish the routes with the sink node. When performing the recovery, we make sure that the least number of nodes will be moving so that total movement distance can be minimized to improve the lifetime of the WSN. Our proposed approach depends only on the local information to not only minimize the messaging overhead on the sensors but also to ensure the scalability when large-scale failures and larger networks are considered. The effectiveness of the proposed route recovery approach is validated through simulation experiments.","0742-1303","978-1-4244-8387-7","","10.1109/LCN.2010.5735796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5735796","","Lead;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Partitioning algorithms;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","large-scale failures;local partition detection algorithm;mobile sensor networks;mobility-based selfroute recovery;multiple node failures;sensor mobility;sink node;wireless sensor networks","","6","","28","","","10-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These characteristics make MANET more vulnerable to attack. In ad hoc network, active attack i.e. DOS, and blackhole attack can easily occur. These attacks could decrease the performance of the routing protocol. We have proposed a new trust mechanism to secure the AODV routing protocol called Trust AODV. In this paper, we improve the performance of our proposed secure protocol by using an ant algorithm. Ant agent put a positive pheromone when the node is trusted. Path communication is chosen based on pheromone value. We evaluate and compare the performance of proposed protocol before and after using ant algorithm under DOS/DDOS attack. The simulation result shows the performance of proposed protocol increases while using ant algorithm in term of packet delivery ratio and throughput. However, in term of end-to-end delay there is no significant effect to the performance.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883591","AODV;Ant algorithm;Performance;Security;Trust mechanism","Abstracts;Decision support systems;Multimedia communication;Routing protocols;Security;Software","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols","AODV routing protocol;DDOS attack;DOS attack;MANET;ant algorithm;end-to-end delay;mobile ad hoc network;packet delivery ratio;path communication;performance analysis;secure protocol;throughput;trust AODV optimization;wireless network","","0","","14","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to avoid both intra- and inter-BAN interference, we present a MAC protocol with two-layer interference mitigation (2L-MAC) for BANs. Considering the QoS requirements of BANs, the proposed protocol not only avoids packet collisions but also reduces transmission delay and energy consumption in sensors. Moreover, channel switching is triggered whenever a BAN needs to acquire more bandwidth.

In this paper, we introduce enabling techniques for such a surveillance need. Specifically, we build explicit 3D models and use them for vehicle signature extraction and matching. The algorithm uses a single active shape model (ASM) for all consumer vehicles. After detecting presence of a vehicle, eg, by background subtraction, our algorithm then reconstructs a texture mapped 3D model. 3D car models enable us to monitor vehicles in many novel ways otherwise impossible.

Considering link capacity constrained topologies, we derive results that optimally allocate rate/distortion to information collected by the sensors. As a key contribution, we determine how the flow of information emanating from the sensors should be managed, yielding optimal routing algorithms and jointly optimized networks. Our analysis encompasses the typical scenarios that are widely observed in sensor networks, and over these scenarios, we quantify the gains offered by sending the statistics rather than the measurement data itself. Our results reveal bottleneck situations over various scenarios, where directly performing bandwidth allocation over the statistics does not provide the desired gains. We start the analysis from a simple scenario, where a fixed node aggregates all the information in the sensor network and relays the information to a remote control center. We obtain close form expressions and illustrate how allocating bandwidth for each individual measurement (Case-1) performs compared to allocating it for each desired statistic (Case-2) in different bottleneck situations. Then, we extend this scenario to the case where we optimally select a number of aggregators from a cloud of sensor nodes. In this second scenario, under well defined bandwidth constraints, we look at the optimum clustering problem, in which the goal is to select the best aggregation nodes to minimize the total distortion of the desired statistics at the remote control node. We provide an algorithmic solution that returns the optimum aggregation points and the optimum size of each cluster under some mild assumptions. We finally turn our attention to the general routing problem and provide an algorithm that performs routing and bandwidth allocation jointly. We also study the performance and beha- ior of bandwidth allocation for both Case-1 and Case-2","","0-7803-9403-8","","10.1109/SSP.2005.1628746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628746","","Bandwidth;Capacitive sensors;Channel allocation;Clustering algorithms;Distortion measurement;Network topology;Rate distortion theory;Routing;Statistics;Wireless sensor networks","bandwidth allocation;data compression;radio links;statistics;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","bandwidth allocation;bandwidth constraints;capacity constrained wireless sensor networks;data compression;link capacity;network routing;remote control center;routing algorithms;statistics","","1","","18","","","17-20 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method is an add-on component that improves the existing optical flow estimation to be balanced between forward and backward flows. Most of the state-of-the-art optical flow methods only consider unidirectional motion vectors from a source image to a target image, which can make the estimated flow inconsistent with its backward estimation. The inconsistency can be reduced by considering the bidirectional motion when the optical flow is estimated, but it would be very hard for most of the typical optical flow methods and impossible for some of them. To solve this problem, we propose a sampling-based optimization method for efficiently refining the optical flows with a bidirectional constraint. By evaluating on Middle-bury benchmark and public large displacement datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our method quantitatively and qualitatively and for accuracy.","","","","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7026108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7026108","Bidirectional constraint;Optical flow;Particle filter-based optimization","Adaptive optics;Computer vision;Estimation;Integrated optics;Optical filters;Optical imaging;Optimization","image motion analysis;image sequences;optimisation;sampling methods","Middlebury benchmark;backward flow estimation;bidirectional constraint;bidirectional flow consistency;bidirectional motion;forward flow estimation;optical flow estimation;optical flow refinement approach;sampling-based optimization method;unidirectional motion vectors","","0","","","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we conduct further evaluation of PFCM for high-dimensional data and proposed a revised version of PFCM called Hyperspherical PFCM (HPFCM). Modifications have been made in the original PFCM objective function, so that cosine similarity measure could be incorporated in the approach. We apply both the original and revised approaches on six large benchmark data sets, and compare their performance with some of the traditional and recent clustering algorithms for automatic document categorization.

A practical example of a large space structure system is used to demonstrate the design procedure for implementing the singular perturbation techniques.","","","","10.1109/CDC.1985.268521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4048242","","Adaptive control;Control systems;Discrete time systems;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feedback;Open loop systems;Optimal control;Perturbation methods;Reduced order systems;Regulators","","","","1","","13","","","11-13 Dec. 1985","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is thus necessary to supplement it by a second analysis taking of account dysfunctions.

The Levenshtein distance has been postulated to be a suitable branch comparison metric for the Viterbi algorithm on channels not only with substitution errors, but also with insertion/deletion errors. However, to a large extent, this hypothesis has still to be investigated. Pruned convolutional codes are constructed by periodically deleting branches in a high rate convolutional code trellis diagram to create a time varying code. The application of rate compatible pruned codes to hybrid ARQ/FEC schemes is proposed here for channels with insertion, deletion and substitution errors. A new type of Viterbi algorithm based on the Levenshtein distance metric is used as the decoding algorithm.

In this paper, we apply multihop relaying through pervasive short range interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, WiMedia. etc.) in the presence of an infrastructure network (e.g., LTE, WiFi, etc.) to extend the battery lifetime of multi-standard MTs. To this end, MTs exchange context information (conveying channel state information, battery level, etc.) and, whenever beneficial, form a coalition, pool their resources, and perform their tasks cooperatively to enhance their efficiency. We introduce a novel utility function to assess the profitability of cooperation. To incentivize MTs to cooperate, the achieved common utility of the coalition can be distributed among the cooperative MTs by means of energy credits using a solution concept from coalitional game theory. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to extend the battery lifetime of MTs to more than double.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883369","cognitive radio;energy efficiency;game theory;multihop cooperation;multimode radio;short range communication","Batteries;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Power demand;Relays;Vectors","cooperative communication;game theory;mobile radio;telecommunication power supplies","battery lifetime;coalitional game theory;coalitional relay selection game;cooperative mobile terminals;multihop relaying;multistandard mobile terminals;quality of service;ubiquitous connectivity","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, lower technology nodes worsen the cell reliability as it increases the coupling between adjacent DRAM cells, thereby exacerbating different failure modes. This paper investigates the reliability problem due to <italic>Row Hammering </italic>, whereby frequent activations of a given row can cause data loss for its neighboring rows. As DRAM scales to lower technology nodes, the threshold for the number of row activations that causes data loss for the neighboring rows reduces, making Row Hammering a challenging problem for future DRAM chips. To overcome Row Hammering, we propose two architectural solutions: First, <italic>Counter-Based Row Activation (CRA)</italic>, which uses a counter with each row to count the number of row activations. If the count exceeds the row hammering threshold, a dummy activation is sent to neighboring rows proactively to refresh the data. Second, <italic>Probabilistic Row Activation (PRA)</italic>, which obviates storage overhead of tracking and simply allows the memory controller to proactively issue dummy activations to neighboring rows with a small probability for all memory access. Our evaluations show that these solutions are effective at mitigating Row hammering while causing negligible performance loss (<inline-formula> <tex-math>$< $</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=""simple"" xlink:href=""qureshi-ieq1-2332177.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> 1 percent).","1556-6056","","","10.1109/LCA.2014.2332177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840960","Dynamic random access memory, row hammering, data retention, data errors","Computer architecture;Leakage currents;Logic gates;Microprocessors;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Transistors","","","","0","","","","2014-06-20","Jan.-June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As such, we extract the retina blood vessel network topology based on local energy function of blood vessel widths and densities and use it as the main image cue to position the macula-fovea area. Regardless of the severity of most retinal diseases as well as variations in field clarity, the high level topology of the retinal blood vessel flows remains fairly predictable. Compared with conventional algorithms, our method can effectively localize the macula-fovea area on retina images with inadequate field clarity and diseased conditions.

Fed. de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","Today there is a growing interest in the integration of health monitoring applications in portable devices necessitating the development of methods that improve the energy efficiency of such systems. In this paper, we present a systematic approach that enables energy-quality trade-offs in spectral analysis systems for bio-signals, which are useful in monitoring various health conditions as those associated with the heart-rate. To enable such trade-offs, the processed signals are expressed initially in a basis in which significant components that carry most of the relevant information can be easily distinguished from the parts that influence the output to a lesser extent. Such a classification allows the pruning of operations associated with the less significant signal components leading to power savings with minor quality loss since only less useful parts are pruned under the given requirements. To exploit the attributes of the modified spectral analysis system, thresholding rules are determined and adopted at design- and run-time, allowing the static or dynamic pruning of less-useful operations based on the accuracy and energy requirements. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a typical sensor node simulator and results show up-to 82% energy savings when static pruning is combined with voltage and frequency scaling, compared to the conventional algorithm in which such trade-offs were not available. In addition, experiments with numerous cardiac samples of various patients show that such energy savings come with a 4.9% average accuracy loss, which does not affect the system detection capability of sinus-arrhythmia which was used as a test case.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800385","","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Complexity theory;Discrete wavelet transforms;Heart rate variability","body sensor networks;discrete wavelet transforms;electrocardiography;energy conservation;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification","biological signal;cardiac samples;energy efficiency;energy-quality trade-off;health monitoring application;heart rate variability;power spectral analysis;quality scalable;sensor node simulator","","0","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides an efficiency time management scheme with correct data reporting, in which a dynamic time schedule is worked out in real time for the driver or passengers of each accident situations. The time operation of the system emulates the judgment of a traffic policeman on duty or user that may have PDA nearby RFID traffic cone. The image compression present here is used along with RFID information to get a precise event data that composed of image encoding and decoding algorithms called wavelet transform with principle component analysis (PCA) via vector quantization techniques (VQ). The small bit rates for high-speed data transmission with a small space for data storage are required on wireless transmission channel. Simultaneously, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) has to be maintained. The traffic management system model is constructed for testing on traffic lights, vehicles transit and traffic cone with RFID solution system. By applying the proposed technique, performance has been improved which indicated by lower bit rate and better PSNR for image compression algorithm.

In the report there are considered the remote methods and systems for measurement of the optical characteristics of an atmosphere, water media, cloudiness designed on the basis of the concept of elimination of a priori data. This concept consists in the minimal use of a priori information or assumptions about analyzed medium.

This work propose to use their camera, which is often already pointed to the road, to perform some low-complexity analysis of the driving context, with the final aim to detect potentially unsafe conditions. Since content understanding algorithms are typically too complex to run in real time on a mobile device, a driving event detection algorithm is presented based on the side information available from video encoders, which are a highly optimized application in mobile phones. A set of interesting and easy-to-extract features has been identified in the side information and then further reduced and adapted to the specific events of interest. A detection algorithm based on support vector machines has been designed and trained on several hours of video annotated by a human operator to extract the events of interest. The detection algorithm is shown to achieve a good identification rate for the considered events and feature sets. Moreover, results also show that the use of a stereoscopic camera significantly improves the performance of the detection algorithm in most cases.","","","","10.1109/MMSP.2013.6659282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659282","","Cameras;Feature extraction;Mobile handsets;Mutual information;Roads;Stereo image processing;Vectors","cameras;feature extraction;mobile computing;mobile handsets;object detection;support vector machines;video coding","3D video encoder;camera;easy-to-extract features;human operator;low-complexity analysis;low-complexity driving event detection;mobile phones;navigation assistants;side information;support vector machines","","0","","9","","","Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among all the scales and data sets tested, the best performance is always achieved with the relative connectivity, suggesting it might be the best scale for both structural and functional B-cell epitopic residue prediction. Furthermore, all the scales perform better on the structural rather than functional data sets. This indicates that these scales based sequence profiling prediction might be more appropriate for the structural B-cell epitopic residue prediction.

The detail layer is adaptively smoothed to suppress the noise before interpolation and an edge-preserving interpolation method is applied to both layers.

The advantage of this extended S-parameter model is that it can be easily integrated into regular circuit simulators and connected to complex linear or non-linear circuitry. This allows to study both Electro-Magnetic Emission and Immunity phenomena in full detail. In this paper, the extended S-parameter model is specifically applied to the study of Electro-Magnetic Immunity problems. In a first example, the influence of an incoming plane wave on the eye diagram of a differential pair is studied. In a second example, the extended S-parameter formulation is combined with a behavioral model of an integrated circuit in order to characterize the radiated immunity of the integrated circuit.","","","","10.1109/SaPIW.2014.6844551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844551","Electro-Magnetic Immunity;extended S-parameters;integrated circuits","Couplings;Integrated circuit modeling;Microstrip;Ports (Computers);Scattering parameters;Transmission line matrix methods","S-parameters;electromagnetic interference;integrated circuit modelling","circuit port coupling;circuit simulator;combined circuit-full wave simulations;electromagnetic emission;electromagnetic immunity;electronic subcomponent;extended S-parameter formulation;extended S-parameter model;integrated circuit immunity","","0","","6","","","11-14 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20081222","2007","","","732","735","The multiuser detection of space coded, multi input multi output (MIMO), code division multiple access (CDMA) signals in the downlink direction with channel estimation error is investigated. The main challenge in the system is dealing with the errors in estimating the channel coefficients at the receiving antennas. The performance of the decorrelating detector (DD) under different channel estimation errors, timing errors, and impulsive noise is investigated. A new robust decorrelating detector (RDD) is proposed which compensates the channel estimation errors by modifying the channel matrix in the system. RDD also deals with the timing errors by the modification of the spreading matrix, and finally, it passes the impulsive components of the additive noise through a robust non-linearity to reduce the impulsive effects. The results show that the performance of the RDD is superior to that of the DD.","","978-1-4244-1235-8","978-1-4244-1236-5","10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4728423","MIMO CDMA;channel estimation error;impulsive noise;timing errors","Channel estimation;Decorrelation;Detectors;Downlink;MIMO;Multiaccess communication;Multiuser detection;Noise robustness;Receiving antennas;Timing","MIMO communication;channel estimation;code division multiple access;multiuser detection","additive noise;channel estimation error;channel matrix;code division multiple access;impulsive noise;multiinput multioutput signals;multiuser detection;robust MIMO-CDMA decorrelating detector;space code signal;spreading matrix;timing errors","","0","","11","","","24-27 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The data is generally hierarchically structured but extremely complex - it consists of hundreds or even thousands of ""classes"" (roughly speaking, distinct labels on a tree), with the same information occurring in different formats across many classes in a hierarchy. The data is also required to satisfy a gigantic number of integrity constraints, vital to the correct routing of phone calls. The challenge is to create tools for populating this data, updating the data, and propagating these updates to derived data; all without violating these integrity constraints. The aim of this article is to give an overview of recent projects at Bell Labs that tackle this problem. Declarative languages play a key role. Indeed, we can think of a solution as consisting of languages for: the integrity constraints, the large-scale changes to the data, and the relationships between base data and derived data. In this article the author starts by explaining the languages used, and the key algorithmic ideas behind the tools. Generally these tools can all be seen as ""implementations"" of closure properties of definable tree and tree-structured data languages. The author then discusses briefly some of the pragmatic issues in getting these systems used in industrial projects.","1043-6871","0-7695-2266-1","","10.1109/LICS.2005.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509214","","Application software;Base stations;Boolean functions;Computer science;Electrical capacitance tomography;High level languages;Large-scale systems;Logic;Routing;Runtime","XML;data integrity;database languages;database management systems;formal logic;telecommunication computing;tree data structures","declarative languages;definable tree closure properties;integrity constraints;telecommunication systems;tree-structured data languages","","0","","","","","26-29 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different attributes based on pulse shape analysis are used as representative feature vectors that can accurately capture the unique and salient characteristics of the PD pulse shape. In the training phase, a decision tree is developed to relate the pulse shape with the cavity size by using inductive machine learning. The C4.5 machine learning algorithm is deployed to realize the tree using the training data, since it has the capability of inferring the rules and to produce the tree in terms of continuous features. During testing, the cavity size is recognized by means of the rules extracted from the decision tree. The dependency between the features and the classes are examined using the mutual information approach. The proposed algorithm possesses the inherent advantage of explaining the result via the self-created rule base as demonstrated by the results obtained. Those self-created rules can be employed as the basis for applying a fuzzy expert system for the classification of void sizes in an easily interpreted fashion.","1070-9878","","","10.1109/TDEI.2005.1430400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430400","","Decision trees;Inference algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partial discharges;Pattern recognition;Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Testing;Training data","decision trees;expert systems;fuzzy systems;inference mechanisms;learning by example;partial discharge measurement;pattern classification;power apparatus;power cables;power engineering computing","C4.5 machine learning algorithm;cables;decision tree approach;fuzzy expert system;inductive inference algorithm;inductive learning;partial discharge;pattern classification;power apparatus;pulse pattern recognition;pulse shape analysis;self-created rule","","7","","22","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The mask is re-used for the second exposure by applying a translational mask-shift. An additional non-critical trim exposure is applied to remove extra printed features. ST-DPL can be used to pattern critical layers and is very suitable for regular and gridded layouts, where redesign effort and area overhead are minimal. In this paper, the viability of ST-DPL is demonstrated through a design implementation at the poly and contacts layers in bidirectional layouts. Standard-cell layouts are constructed so as to avoid layout decomposition conflicts, which are found to be the limiting factor for the pitch relaxation that can be achieved with double patterning (ST-DPL as well as standard DPL). 2&times; pitch relaxation being associated with a considerable area overhead, 1.8 &times; pitch relaxation is achieved in our implementation while ensuring no layout decomposition conflicts and a small area overhead. Specifically, in comparison to layouts assumed to be feasible with a hypothetical single-patterning process, we observe virtually no area overhead when ST-DPL is applied to the poly layer (<; 0.3% cell-area overhead) and no more than 4.7% cell-area overhead when ST-DPL is applied at both the poly and contacts layers. The proposed method has many benefits over standard pitch-split double patterning: 1) cuts mask-cost to nearly half; 2) reduces overlay errors between the two patterns; 3) alleviates the bimodal line-width distribution problem in double patterning; and 4) slightly enhances the throughput of critical-layer scanners.","0894-6507","","","10.1109/TSM.2010.2076305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571032","Bimodal CD distribution;double patterning;manufacturing throughput;mask cost;overlay;photomask;shift-trim;trim exposure","Layout;Libraries;Lithography;Logic gates;Manufacturing processes;Resists;Throughput","integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit manufacture;lithography;masks","area overhead;bidirectional layouts;bimodal line-width distribution;critical layers;improved overlay control;layout decomposition conflicts;limiting factor;non-critical trim exposure;pitch relaxation;shift-trim double-patterning lithography;single-mask double-patterning lithography;translational mask-shift","","4","1","40","","2010-09-13","Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using a set of 17 sensors, the inertial signals corresponding to position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, angular velocity and angular acceleration are recorded based on a 23 degree of freedom humanoid model. The data streams obtained are subsequently segmented by an intrinsic clustering algorithm known as Minimum Message Length encoding (MML) forming a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Several postural states (exemplar motion primitives) are captured in the resultant model, which is subsequently utilized to derive a holistic index corresponding to the physical ambulatory status of patient. The proposed method is applied to both data collected pre- and post-fatigue performance. The results are encouraging as they clearly demonstrate that fatigue affects physical status during 6MWT.

Although several adaptive control techniques have been introduced, it is not strong to many real-world problem domains where the degree of uncertainty is too high and the computational complexity grows geometrically with the number of unknown parameters and its inherent linear nature of an assumed dynamic model. With an environment which is only partially known, it is desirable that the system be able to gradually learn the characteristics of the environment so as to improve its control strategy.

The system should be able to learn from its experience in order to achieve some form of “intelligence”.

In this paper, we propose a new AC current control method with constant switching frequency. This controller is a hybrid controller using both sliding mode control and peak current control. The sliding mode controller generates robustness properties according to the load parameter variations and the peak controller method ensures rapid dynamic response and a fixed switching frequency, well adapted to the current tracking issues like harmonic filtering. In addition, its implementation is relatively simple. To explain the irregular current comportment not foreseen by the high frequency average model a mathematical analysis adapted to chaos theory is developed.

One of the major problems appearing in such interconnection schemes is related to the propagation, transport, and communication delays acting ""through"" and/or ""inside"" the interconnections. Without any loss of generality, the origin of such delays can be: the physical separation between the systems defining the interconnections, the presence of the human factor in the decision process, or finally the existence of some hierarchy, and/or synchronization at the lowest levels in the decision process in real-time. The aim of this paper is to present briefly some ""user-friendly"" methods and techniques (only frequency-domain approaches) for the analysis and control of the dynamical systems in presence of time- delays.

In particular, we define S-trees to include both binary X-trees and pyramids, and present two embeddings of X-trees into 2-D processor arrays with spanning buses. The first embedding has the property that all neighboring nodes in X-trees are mapped to the same bus in the target array, thus allowing any two neighbors in the embedded S-trees to communicate with each other in one routing step. The disadvantage of this embedding is its relatively high expansion cost. In contrast, the second embedding has an expansion cost approaching unity, but does not map all neighboring nodes in X-trees to the same bus.

These issues need to be addressed before a true next generation optical Internet can emerge. We enumerate some of the key architectural, management and control issues and discuss corresponding approaches and advances made toward addressing these issues. We first review the different IP/WDM networking architectural models and their tradeoffs. We outline and discuss several management and control issues and corresponding approaches related to the configuration, fault, and performance management of IP over dynamic WDM networks. We present an analysis and supporting simulation results demonstrating the potential benefits of dynamic IP over WDM networks.

Two distinct distribution approaches used today are layered coding (LC) and multiple description coding (MDC). Current wireless connection technologies, e.g. Wimax, have properties which make them unsuitable for media distribution using traditional approaches. In particular, the asymmetric relationship between the uplink and the downlink bandwidth makes the cooperative distribution difficult. A promising concept, termed MDC with Conditional Compression (MDC-CC), has been proposed [11], which essentially acts as an adaptive hybrid between LC and MDC. In order to facilitate the use of MDC-CC, a new overlay network approach is proposed, using tree of meshes. A control system for managing description distribution and compression in a small mesh is implemented in the discrete event simulator NS-2. The two traditional approaches, MDC and LC, are used as references for the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme. The system is simulated in a heterogeneous network environment, where packet errors are introduced. Moreover, a test is performed at different network loads. Performance gain is shown over both LC and MDC.","","978-1-4244-2099-5","978-1-4244-2100-8","10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4594910","","Adaptive systems;Bandwidth;Control system synthesis;Discrete event simulation;Downlink;Performance evaluation;Streaming media;Testing;Web and internet services;WiMAX","Internet;channel coding;media streaming;radiocommunication","Internet;MDC with conditional compression;Wimax;adaptive network compression;control system;cooperative media streaming;discrete event simulator;downlink bandwidth;layered coding;media content distribution;multiple description coding;packet errors;tree of meshes;uplink bandwidth;wireless connection technologies","","2","","18","","","23-26 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Empirical models for the process on a target tool are obtained through a design of experiments (DOE) and a control solution is suggested for the two primary outputs of the CMP process, namely post-polish film thickness and film uniformity. With this factory-wide run-to-run control solution design, post process measurements made after every CMP run are used along with pre-process measurements, empirical process models, and drift compensation and noise rejection techniques to suggest new equipment settings for the next run. It has been observed that good control of post-polish film thickness can be obtained.

Success of integration depends largely on the mental model of integration subject. An integration subject's mental model, from a narrow sense, is the mental model who should have to become an integration manager. In the preparatory stage of integration, what plays a very key role may be the integration subject's mental model.

Embolic signals are short duration transient like signals. Embolic signals can be extracted from quadrature Doppler signals, which are obtained at the end of quadrature demodulation. The wavelet transform is an ideal method for analysis and detection of such signals by optimizing time-frequency resolution. In literature systems employing discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for detecting embolic signals exist. Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which is a shift invariant transform with limited redundancy, is an improved version of DWT. Conventionally, prior to applying the DTCWT to an quadrature signal, first the quadrature signal must be decoded into forward and reverse signals and then two DTCWT should be applied. However, modified dual-tree complex wavelet transform (MDTCWT), which reduces the computational complexity compared to conventional algorithm, can be used. In this study a new emboli detection system based on MDTCWT is proposed. In detection algorithm, embolic signals and artifact signals were decomposed to nine scales and different features were extracted from each scale. Then for each scale, by using extracted features a new feature vector was created and these feature vectors are fed into support vector machines individually and the comparative results of individual feature sets are proposed.","","978-1-4577-2176-2","978-1-4577-2175-5","10.1109/BHI.2012.6211744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211744","","Doppler effect;Electronic mail;Redundancy","biomedical ultrasonics;discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;medical signal detection;support vector machines;trees (mathematics)","artifact signal;asymptomatic circulating cerebral emboli;computational complexity;discrete wavelet transform;embolic Doppler ultrasound signal detection;modified dual tree complex wavelet transform;quadrature Doppler signal;quadrature demodulation;signal extraction;support vector machine;time-frequency resolution","","0","","14","","","5-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The demand for using this medium ranges from security, military, Internet and scientific purposes and are rapidly replacing wire-line systems in many developing countries. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is currently a research area that is being studied by many researchers and industries within the wireless communication arena. It is not only being considered for use for target detection, environmental monitoring and tactical systems, but is also a promising technology for use in multimedia systems such as streaming video and surveillance. The use of multichannel assignment can substantially improve the performance of WSNs using the IEEE specifications of non-overlapping channels simultaneously. The 802.11 multichannel Medium Access Control (MAC) schemes do not efficiently utilize this technology owing to the overhead caused by channel assignments. In this paper a new approach is used by applying multichannel to reduce the waiting time of a node when attempting to access a busy medium. The back-off algorithm will switch channel when the contention window of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) has reach an assigned threshold. The sink node will perform interface switching to receive data from channels coming from source nodes.","2154-0217","978-1-4244-6315-2","","10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5624520","802.11 DCF;Channels;MAC;Multi-channel;WSN","Delay;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Switches;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks","MAC solution;distributed coordination function;medium access control;multi-channel single radio;wireless sensor networks","","0","","26","","","19-22 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new method for creating meeting video skims based on audio and visual activity analysis together with text analysis. Audio activity analysis is performed by analyzing sound directions-indicating different speakers-and audio amplitude. Detection of important visual events in a meeting is achieved by analyzing the localized luminance variations in consideration with the omni-directional property of the video captured by our meeting recording system. Text analysis is based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency measure.

Concurrent systems, esp. when being large-scale, are known to be hard to design as the overall system behavior non-linearly results from local behavior and interactions. They are also hard to engineer and debug, as time dependent errors are often hard to reproduce. Simulation tools and environments are often used to assist in this task. From our experience in developing and using simulators for decentralized systems (in traffic, logistics and smart power grid management), we learned that a simulation environment should comply to the following quality criteria. First, from a software engineering point of view, a simulation environment itself must be designed up to the highest software quality standards - modularity, separation of concerns, test-driven development, guaranteed state consistency, etc. are particularly important quality criteria to ensure correctness, extensibility and manageability of the software. Second, the simulation environment must provide convenient support for using and extending the simulation environment, ease the visualization of solutions, and - since its use in scientific process - offer direct support for evaluating CAS through the set-up of experiments. In this paper, we present RinSim, an open source simulator that explicitly addresses these quality criteria, and targets the large family of transportation and logistics applications. RinSim separates the definition of the problem domain from the solution, has a modular design, is being developed in a test-driven way, etc. RinSim has been used and extended in a variety of cases within our research group, and served as the core platform in our educational program on multi-agent software development.","1949-3673","978-1-4673-3126-5","","10.1109/SASO.2012.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394135","collective adaptive systems;logistics;multi-agent systems;simulation;simulator;transportation","Adaptive systems;Logistics;Roads;Software;Space exploration;Vehicles","adaptive systems;concurrent engineering;data visualisation;digital simulation;logistics;multi-agent systems;public domain software;road traffic;software management;software quality;transportation","RinSim;collective adaptive systems;concurrent systems;decentralized systems;educational program;logistics;multiagent software development;open source simulator;quality criteria;road traffic;scientific process;simulation environment;smart power grid management;software correctness;software engineering;software extensibility;software manageability;software quality standards;system behavior nonlinearly;test-driven development;transportation","","1","","3","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is attributed to the poor Side Information (SI) estimated at the decoder and to the inability of the channel codes to recover the source at the Slepian-Wolf (SW) limits. This paper tackles the latter issue by recovering the SI bit-planes starting from the most unreliable bit of each coefficient. Most of the mismatch in SI is thus accumulated within the first decoded bit-planes, leaving the last bit-planes with very few or no mismatch. Low-Density Parity-Check Accumulate (LDPCA) codes can then benefit from such compact distribution of correlation noise since they offer a smaller percentage error, from the SW bounds, when mismatch is accumulated in few higher entropy bit-planes. Furthermore, with this setup, most of the last bit-planes can be recovered very effectively using just 8-bit or 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Codes. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the Wyner-Ziv bit-rates by up to 21% compared to the DISCOVER codec.","","","","10.1109/MMSP.2013.6659263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659263","","Codecs;Correlation;Decoding;Encoding;Noise;Silicon;Video coding","channel coding;cyclic redundancy check codes;entropy;parity check codes;video codecs;video coding","DISCOVER codec;LDPCA;Slepian-Wolf limits;Wyner-Ziv video coding performance;channel codes;coding efficiency;correlation noise;cyclic redundancy codes;distributed video coding;entropy bit planes;low-density parity-check accumulate codes;predictive video coding;side information;word length 16 bit;word length 8 bit","","0","","29","","","Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main problem of the composition is with the correct alignment of adjacent picture frames, which is called registration. This alignment is accomplished according to the similarity of the border areas of the adjacent picture frames. The area of the adjacent picture frames which is common to both of them (overlapping) is an important parameter. The larger this area, the more simple is the alignment but the less efficient is the mosaic composition. Alignment like registration in general may require changes (normalization) of the intensity histogram and scale, compensation of deformations, and a combination of rotations and translations of the pictures. However, in the case of picture frames captured by an optical microscope with a reproducible controlled stage, like in our case of a CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscope) application, the required modifications of both picture frames can be reduced to translations only","","0-7803-4318-2","","10.1109/ITAB.1997.649418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=649418","","Histograms;Humans;Image registration;Mutual information;Nonlinear optics;Optical control;Optical microscopy;Physiology;Position measurement;Probability distribution","image registration;laser beam applications;optical microscopy;optical scanners","CLSM;adjacent picture frame alignment;border area similarity;confocal laser scanning microscope;confocal laser scanning microscopy;deformation compensation;image registration;intensity histogram;inverse relation;microscope magnification;normalization;observation field size;optical microscope;overlapping area;picture frame mosaic composition;picture rotation;picture translation;reproducible controlled stage;scale","","1","","6","","","7-9 Sep 1997","07 Sep 1997-09 Sep 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To jointly take advantage of the spatial and spectral information, HSI has been recently represented as tensor. Offering multiple ways to decompose data orthogonally, we introduced DR methods based on multilinear-algebra tools.

"Construction of slope-consistent trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets for simplifying the perceptual reasoning method","Chengdong Li; Jianqiang Yi; Guiqing Zhang; Ming Wang","Sch. of Inf. & Electr. Eng., Shandong Jianzhu Univ., Jinan, China","Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), 2014 IEEE International Conference on","20140908","2014","","","1261","1267","Computing with words (CWW) proposed by Zadeh is an useful paradigm to mimic the human decision-making ability in a wide variety of physical and mental tasks. To realize CWW, Mendel proposed a specific architecture called perceptual computer, in which interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets (FSs) and perceptual reasoning (PR) method are adopted. The PR method has been proved to have good properties (e.g. it can output intuitive IT2 FSs) and has found several applications in decision making. In this study, we focus on simplifying this method by avoiding its a-cuts based inference process. We first present a novel property for the inference of the PR method. We observe from the property that, if the IT2 FSs in the consequents of the IF-THEN rules are trapezoidal and have consistent slopes, then the output IT2 FS will be strictly trapezoidal and can be determined easily. In this case, the computation of the PR method can be simplified. To achieve such simplification, the trapezoidal IT2 FSs without consistent slopes should be approximated by the slope-consistent trapezoidal IT2 FSs. This issue is also studied in this paper by solving the constrained linear-quadratic optimization problem. At last, examples are given.

The research has examined the domestic management of the employees. According to this empirical analysis, foreign direct investments by Japanese manufacturers in Vietnam plays an important place on domestic management, however, at present, implementing domestic management is difficult, especially on human resource management. The main factor is that training domestic employees, especially managers, takes time, and it is hard to integrate Japanese and Vietnamese cultures within just a few years. Moreover, firms strive to collaborate with domestic suppliers in order to gain sources of competitive advantage, but the services and technologies of domestic suppliers must be improved.","","978-1-4244-8785-1","","10.1109/CASoN.2010.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636707","Collaboration;Domestic Management;Japanese Manufacturers;Strategic Alliance","Collaboration;Correlation;Economics;Investments;Materials;Supply chains","human resource management;international trade;investment;personnel;supply chain management","Japanese manufacturer;Vietnam;domestic Collaboration;domestic management;foreign direct investment;human resource management;multinational enterprises;strategic alliance;supply chain model","","0","","29","","","26-28 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem we propose to perform image-based gating applying a genetic algorithm (GA) that automatically selects a subset of OCT cross-sections that are relatively unaffected by the catheter displacement during the cardiac cycle. The gated subset contains cross-sections (frames) acquired in the near end-diastolic phase, during which the heart is relatively motionless.

The FISR utilizes the scan-in-scan-out design inject faults to the internal circuits of a VLSI chip. The fault injection is accomplished by loading a pair of fault vectors to a set of fault latches via the scan registers. The fault latches are then enabled so that the target signals will be forced to high or low during the normal operation. the delivery of injected faults via the scan registers and the concept of fault vector are the major innovations in the design.

A simpler suboptimum structure that replaces the continuous weighting of the optimal receiver by a hard decision over each detector element is also described.

These experiments are useful for studying material properties under kilobar to megabar pressures. The Z driver at Sandia National Laboratories has been used for such studies on a variety of materials, including heavy water, diamond, and tantalum, to name a few. In such experiments, it is important to prevent shock formation in the material samples. Shocks can form as the sound speed increases with loading; at some depth in the sample a pressure significantly higher than the surface pressure can result. The optimum pressure pulse shape to prevent such shocks depends on the test material and the sample thickness, and is generally not a simple sinusoidal-shaped current as a function of time. A system that can create a variety of pulse shapes would be desirable for testing various materials and sample thicknesses. A large number of relatively fast pulses, combined, could create the widest variety of pulse shapes. Linear transformer driver systems, whose cavities consist of many parallel capacitor-switch circuits, could have considerable agility in pulse shape. We will show results from initial experiments in pulse shaping on a system with two inductively isolated cavities in series. Each cavity contains forty pairs of high voltage capacitors and forty gas-insulated spark gap switches. The capacitors are arranged in a bipolar configuration; the spark gap switches must withstand twice the capacitor voltage. A pulse applied to the switch trigger electrodes initiate closure of each switch. We have arranged triggering in groups of ten switches in each cavity, for a total of eight separate trigger points in the system. The fundamental rise time of each capacitor circuit is roughly 70 nanoseconds; this defines the fastest possible output pulse transition time. The pulse rise time can be made longer, and given features on the rise, by delaying triggers to- some of the switches. We will show initial experimental results from tests of the two-cavity system.","2158-4915","978-1-4577-0629-5","","10.1109/PPC.2011.6191525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6191525","","Capacitors;Cavity resonators;Delay;Generators;Magnetic cores;Materials;Monitoring","diamond;driver circuits;electrodes;gas insulated switchgear;power capacitors;power transformers;pulse shaping;pulse shaping circuits;pulsed power supplies;pulsed power switches;spark gaps;tantalum;water","Sandia National Laboratories;Ta;Z driver;capacitor circuit;current pulses shaping;diamond;gas-insulated spark gap switches;high voltage capacitors;linear transformer driver system;low impedance pulsed power drivers;parallel capacitor-switch circuits;pulse shaping;solids shock compression;switch trigger electrodes;water","","0","","15","","","19-23 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of its most fundamental approaches is Test Driven Development (TDD). This procedure is based on test cases which are incrementally written prior to the implementation. Recently, Behavior Driven Development (BDD) has been introduced as an extension of TDD, in which natural language scenarios are the starting point for the test cases. This description offers a ubiquitous communication mean for both the software developers and stakeholders. Following the BDD methodology thoroughly, one would expect 100 % code coverage, since code is only written to make the test cases pass. However, as we show in an empirical study this expectation is not valid in practice. It becomes even worse in the process of development, i.e. the coverage decreases over time. To close the coverage gap, we sketch an algorithm that generates BDD-style scenarios based on uncovered code.","","","","10.1109/IWAST.2013.6595796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595796","","Boolean functions;Context;Data structures;Natural languages;Software;Testing;Unified modeling language","program testing;software prototyping","BDD methodology;TDD approach;agile development practice;behavior driven development;code coverage;coverage information;natural language scenario;scenario generation;software system design;test driven development","","0","","19","","","18-19 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study investigates sentence-level emotion recognition. We propose to use a two-step approach to leverage information from sub sentence segments for sentence level decision. First we use a segment level emotion classifier to generate predictions for segments within a sentence. A second component combines the predictions from these segments to obtain a sentence level decision. We evaluate different segment units (words, phrases, time-based segments) and different decision combination methods (majority vote, average of probabilities, and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)). Our experimental results on two different data sets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the standard sentence-based classification approach. In addition, we find that using time-based segments achieves the best performance, and thus no speech recognition or alignment is needed when using our method, which is important to develop language independent emotion recognition systems.","1520-6149","978-1-4577-0538-0","978-1-4577-0537-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5947464","Decision model;Emotion;Segment;Subsentence","Data models;Databases;Emotion recognition;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech recognition;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;emotion recognition;speech recognition","GMM;Gaussian mixture model;intelligent systems;sentence level decision;sentence level emotion recognition;speech recognition;subsentence segments","","6","","16","","","22-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this first part, we present a centralized approach for the generation of mesh (wireless sensor) network configurations that provide complete sensing coverage and communication connectivity of a domain. A challenging problem in deploying wireless sensor networks is maximizing coverage in irregular shaped polygonal areas while maintaining a high degree of node connectivity. The novelties presented in this paper are: 1) a centralized mesh simplification technique, the Iterative Node Removal with Constrained Delaunay Triangulation and Smoothing (INRCDTS) algorithm, and 2) a centralized mesh generation approach with INRCDTS that may be used for any nonintersecting closed polygonal area. Additionally, we provide a comparison of two centralized mesh generation techniques. The INRCDTS was built and tested as an enhancement of two traditional mesh generation techniques: advancing front technique and Matlab partial differential equation toolbox. The INCRCDTS introduces the ability to tune the generated mesh configuration to the number of nodes and nodal spacing. The INRCDTS enhancement has proven to increase the uniformity of the mesh in an irregular shaped polygonal area relative to advancing front and MATLAB partial differential equation algorithms by 23% and 41%, respectively.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2013.2245906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459011","Delaunay triangulation;mesh generation;mesh simplification;sensor node;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Geometry;Lakes;MATLAB;Mesh generation;Sensors;Smoothing methods;Wireless sensor networks","mesh generation;partial differential equations;wireless sensor networks","INRCDTS algorithm;centralized algorithm;centralized mesh generation approach;centralized mesh simplification technique;constrained Delaunay triangulation and smoothing;decentralized approach;irregular shaped polygonal area;iterative node removal;node connectivity;partial differential equation;wireless sensor network","","3","","34","","2013-02-08","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20051212","2005","","","8 pp.","680","Volunteer forwarding, as an emerging routing idea for large scale, location-aware wireless sensor networks, recently has attracted a significant amount of research attention. However, several critical research issues raised by volunteer forwarding, including priority assignment, acknowledgement collisions and communication voids, have not been well addressed by the existing work. In this paper, we propose a priority-based stateless geo-routing (PSGR) protocol to address these issues. Based on PSGR, sensor nodes are able to locally determine their priority to serve as the next relay node using dynamically estimated network density. This effectively suppresses potential communication collisions without prolonging routing delays. PSGR also overcomes the communication void problem using two alternative stateless schemes, rebroadcast and bypass. We analyze energy consumption and delivery rate of PSGR as functions of transmission range. An extensive performance evaluation has been conducted to compare PSGR with competing protocols, including GeRaf, IGF, GPSR and flooding. Simulation results show that PSGR exhibits superior performance in terms of energy consumption, routing latency and delivery rate, and soundly outperforms all of the compared protocols","","0-7803-9465-8","","10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542858","","Delay effects;Energy consumption;Floods;Intelligent networks;Large-scale systems;Probes;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","acknowledgement collisions;energy consumption;extensive performance evaluation;location-aware wireless sensor networks;network density estimation;potential communication collision suppression;priority-based stateless georouting protocols;relay node;volunteer forwarding","","10","","21","","","7-7 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distant hybridization strategy and a new method of adaptively changing crossover rate are presented by combining the scheme of multi-population and the thought of elitist population. Considered the different range of decision variables, the new definitions of individual distance and population distance are put forward, which avoids the false distance caused by traditional hamming distance.

In a third step, pixels outside the lumen area are classified as vessel wall or background, using the same GentleBoost framework with a different set of image features. Finally, a 2-D ellipse shape deformable model is fitted to a cost image derived from both the calcium and vessel wall classifications. The method has been validated on a dataset of 60 CTA images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the method is comparable to the interobserver variability.","0278-0062","","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2025702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109709","Carotid;classification;computed tomography angiography (CTA);outer vessel wall;segmentation","Angiography;Calcium;Carotid arteries;Computed tomography;Costs;Deformable models;Image segmentation;Level set;Pixel;Shape","angiocardiography;computerised tomography;image segmentation;medical image processing","2D ellipse shape deformable model;GentleBoost framework;carotid lumen;common carotid artery;computed tomography angiography;outer vessel wall segmentation","Algorithms;Angiography;Bayes Theorem;Carotid Artery, Common;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Normal Distribution;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","12","","40","","2009-06-23","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While NC in general reduces the number of packets sent through the network, EC introduces redundancy into the packet streams to recover from lost packets. Many research papers in NC assume loss-free packet transmission, and to address this issue, end-to-end packet loss recovery through EC has been proposed. In this paper, we investigate hop-by-hop packet loss recovery through EC so as to avoid the accumulation of lost packets throughout the network using flow oriented EC. Specifically, we explore combined NC and EC at intermediate nodes in the networks to allow for improved packet loss recovery compared to end-to-end EC. Different implementations trading the packet processing complexity at the intermediate and destination nodes are considered. This paper first examines the effects of data loss in NC and then the improvements achievable with the proposed method are presented.","","978-1-4244-7908-5","978-1-4244-7906-1","10.1109/ICSPCS.2010.5709695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5709695","","Encoding;Equations;Mathematical model;Network coding;Reliability;Routing;Throughput","information theory;network coding","end-to-end packet loss recovery;erasure coding;hop-by-hop packet loss recovery;network coding;network intermediate nodes;packet delivery","","0","","7","","","13-15 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work is part of ongoing efforts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to advance the state of the art in waveform sampling metrology. In this paper, we describe an analytic error model for a sampler having a -3 dB bandwidth of 6 GHz. The model is derived from examination of the sampler's error behavior in the phase-plane. The model takes as inputs the per-sample estimates of signal amplitude, first derivative, and second derivative where the derivatives are with respect to time. The model's analytic form consists of polynomials in these terms chosen from consideration of the voltage dependence of digitizer input capacitance and previously studied error behavior in a predecessor digitizer. At 1 GHz, an improvement in total harmonic distortion from -32 dB to -46 dB is obtained when model-generated sample corrections are applied to the waveform. The effect of timebase distortion in the sampling system is also accounted for and corrected. The inclusion of second derivative dependence in the model is shown to improve the model's fit to the measured data by providing fine temporal adjustment of the fitted waveform","","0-7803-8879-8","","10.1109/IMTC.2005.1604061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1604061","","Amplitude estimation;Bandwidth;Distortion measurement;Error analysis;Metrology;NIST;Phase distortion;Polynomials;Sampling methods;Voltage","analogue-digital conversion;harmonic distortion;signal sampling;waveform analysis","6 GHz;digitizer input capacitance;digitizing sampler;distortion behavior;dynamic signal measurement;phase-plane derived distortion modeling;timebase distortion;total harmonic distortion;waveform sampling metrology","","0","","18","","","16-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This adversely affects the performance of many computer vision techniques developed for clear open-air conditions, including stereo matching, when applied to images acquired in these environments. Since the strength of the scattering depends on the distance to the scene points, the scattering field embodies range information that can be exploited for 3-D reconstruction. In this paper, we present an integrated solution for 3-D structure from stereovision that incorporates the visual cues from both disparity and scattering. The method applies to images of scenes illuminated by artificial sources and natural lighting, and performance improves with discrepancy between the backscatter fields in the two views. Neither source calibration nor knowledge of medium optical properties is required. Instead, backscatter fields at infinity, i.e., stereo images taken with no target in the field of view, are directly employed in the estimation process. Results from experiments with synthetic and real data demonstrate the key advantages of our method.","1057-7149","","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2358882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901274","Stereo vision;dense correspondence;scattering media;scene reconstruction","Backscatter;Cameras;Lighting;Media;Optical imaging;Optical scattering","backscatter;computer vision;estimation theory;image matching;image reconstruction;stereo image processing","3D reconstruction;artificial sources;backscatter fields;clear open-air conditions;computer vision techniques;image contrast;natural lighting;range information;scattering field;scattering media;scene points;stereo images;stereo matching;stereovision;visual cues","","0","","34","","2014-09-17","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Joint Call Admission Control Algorithm for Fair Radio Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Supporting Heterogeneous Mobile Terminals","Falowo, O.E.; Chan, H.A.","Dept. of Electr.

Low-capability mobile terminals (such as single-mode terminals) suffer high call blocking probability whereas high-capability mobile terminals (such as quad-mode terminals) experience very low call blocking probability, in the same heterogeneous wireless network. This paper proposes a joint call admission control (JCAC) algorithm to reduce this problem of unfairness. The proposed JCAC algorithm makes call admission decisions based on mobile terminal modality (capability), network load, and radio access technology (RAT) terminal support index. The objectives of the proposed JCAC algorithm are to reduce call blocking/ dropping probability, and ensure fairness in allocation of radio resources among heterogeneous mobile terminals in heterogeneous networks. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the proposed JCAC scheme in heterogeneous wireless networks and derive expression for call blocking / dropping probability. The performance of the proposed JCAC algorithm is compared with that of other JCAC algorithm. Results show the proposed algorithm reduces call blocking/ dropping probability in the networks, and ensure fairness in allocation of radio resources among heterogeneous terminals.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421734","","Africa;Call admission control;Cities and towns;Communications Society;Next generation networking;Paper technology;Radio access networks;Rats;Resource management;Wireless networks","mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication terminals","JCAC scheme;call blocking/dropping probability;fair radio resource allocation;heterogeneous mobile terminals;heterogeneous networks;heterogeneous wireless networks;high call blocking probability;joint call admission control algorithm;radio access technology","","5","","7","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the algorithm, sub populations are divided into exploration and exploitation types. The global version PSO is used in the exploration population to enhance ability of exploring the best individual, and the local version PSO is used in the exploitation population to enhance ability of local search and find the best global result in the local range. Simultaneously, keep communication with sub populations in running.

This function can only be given by a TTP (Trusted Third Party). This TTP has to be able to check the validity and authenticity of all the data included in the original document, and translate it to the other environment, signing the translation, to certify, not only the authenticity of the data, but also the signatory of the original document.

After the structural identification in the beginning of the 20th century by John D. Bernal, graphite became a material of intense study. In the 1950s and 1960s, the physics and chemistry of graphite started to be developed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Soon after, graphite intercalation compounds and the synthesis of carbon microfibers became popular, and then in 1985, the era of nanocarbons started with the discovery of fullerenes (carbon cage molecules), followed by the structural identification of nanotubes and the isolation of graphene. Today, these three novel nanocarbons are being intensively studied and the physico-chemical properties are different among the three. This review intends to provide a historical perspective of these novel forms of carbon and their impact on electronics and other fields. We believe that, within a short time, commercial products based on any of these materials will be a reality but further experimental and theoretical research is still needed in some areas, as well as the development of low-cost production processes for commercial materials, devices, and products.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2013.2261271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6520894","Carbon;fullerenes;graphene;graphite;history;nanocarbons;nanotubes","Atomic measurements;Carbon;Fullerenes;Graphene;Nanomaterials;Nanotubes","carbon;carbon nanotubes;fullerenes;graphene;graphite;history;nanofibres;nanostructured materials","C;carbon based nanomaterial;carbon microfibers;fullerenes;graphene;graphite intercalation compounds;historical perspective;hybridization;nanocarbons;nanotubes;structural identification","","0","","108","","2013-05-27","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For PTFE samples, F, C, K and O elements were detected, and F showed a remarkable atomic ratio of 73.30%. Obviously, the surface chemical elements assignment disagreed with their chemical formula, respectively. We attributed the high percentage of F to quantities of F atoms existing on the surface of PTFE due to its molecular chain with C atoms surrounded by F atoms spirally. The chemical distortion on a solid surface would result in the alteration of surface electron structure and subsequently the adjustment of surface energy distribution. Thus, the solid surface serves as a weak part in a compound dielectric system, which results in the flashover phenomena occurring across the surface/interface region at a low applied electric field.","","0-7803-7394-4","","10.1109/ISDEIV.2002.1027452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1027452","","Ceramics;Chemical analysis;Chemical elements;Dielectrics;Electrons;Flashover;Insulation;Solids;Spectroscopy;Vacuum technology","X-ray photoelectron spectra;alumina;aluminium;carbon;ceramics;flashover;fluorine;insulating materials;polymers;silicon;surface energy;vacuum breakdown","Al;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;C;C atoms;F;F atoms;O;PTFE;Si;X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy;XPS;alumina ceramic;aluminium;atomic ratio;carbon;chemical distortion;compound dielectric system;flashover phenomena;fluorine;high vacuum;low applied electric field;molecular chain;oxygen;polytetrafluoroethylene;solid insulating materials;solid surface;surface chemical elements;surface electron structure;surface energy distribution;surface/interface region","","1","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focused on this topology especially using extreme close-coupled inductors (ECCI). Following the elucidation of design guidelines for the coupled inductor theoretically, the superiority of the interleaved converter using ECCI in terms of reducing the size and losses in the magnetic components is demonstrated clearly through comparison with an interleaved converter using a set of looser-coupled inductors and a conventional single inductor converter. The effect of increasing a magnetic coupling factor of a set of coupled inductors from 0.980 to 0.999 is investigated by comparing it with other inductors of interleaved converters. The high power prototype converter with the coupling factor of 0.999 provides excellent performance with a time rating power density of 25.6 kW/liter.","","978-1-4244-5394-8","","10.1109/IPEC.2010.5542015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542015","Close-Coupled inductors;DC/DC converter;Electric vehicles;High power density","Coils;Couplings;DC-DC power converters;Electric vehicles;Inductors;Power generation;Prototypes;Radiofrequency interference;Research and development;Voltage","DC-DC power convertors;electric vehicles;power inductors","electric vehicles;extreme close-coupled inductors;high power DC-DC converter;high power density;interleaved converter;magnetic components;magnetic coupling factor;single inductor converter","","14","","","","","21-24 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Waterfall model has been with the software industry for over 30 years offering a sequential and linear development approach. However, the impending issues with regards to CTQ have led to rise of agile development methodologies in last couple of decades offering incremental & iterative development, customer collaboration and reduced time to market. The new agile paradigm, on the other side, is also bringing its own challenges and risks primarily in terms of runtime infrastructure cost, network accessibility and platform availability steering towards CTQ issues in a disguised manner. With Cloud Computing gaining popularity over the last few years offering almost zero CAPEX (Capital Expenditure), reduced OPEX (Operational Expenditure), high scalability & availability, it has been considered worthwhile to explore Agile based software development on Cloud. In this article, migration of Agile based project to Cloud has been discussed along with its benefits and challenges at both the stages. While Cloud adoption is a catalyst for Agile based development, there are a few open issues to be addressed.","","978-1-4799-2571-1","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779530","Agile Methodologies;Cloud Computing;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;Scrum","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Planning;Portals;Servers;Testing","cloud computing;software prototyping;software quality","CTQ;agile based software development;agile development methodology;capital expenditure;cloud computing;cost, time and quality;customer collaboration;incremental-iterative development;linear development approach;moving agile based projects;network accessibility;operational expenditure;platform availability;reduced OPEX;reduced time to market;runtime infrastructure cost;sequential development approach;software development methodology;software industry;waterfall model;zero CAPEX","","0","","29","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The physical significance of these results is also examined. With a layer thickness of 50 μm, an applied voltage of 100 V and a polymer concentration of 7 wt%, we show that the decay time can be reduced to about 1/30th that of a plain liquid crystal at the expense of an increase in rise time of about 2.5 times and a deterioration of dielectric birefringence of about 50%. Also, by varying the PDLC layer thickness with a polymer concentration of 5 wt% and an applied electric field fixed at 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> V/m, we show that increasing the layer thickness causes the decay time to increase and the rise time to decrease. The rise time obtained with a PDLC layer thickness of 100 μm is half the value obtained with a thickness of 20 μm, while the decay time is approximately 3.6 times larger.","01490-645X","0-7803-8845-3","","10.1109/MWSYM.2005.1517083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517083","","Delay;Dielectric liquids;Dielectric measurements;Liquid crystal devices;Liquid crystal polymers;Microstrip;Microwave bands;Microwave measurements;Thickness measurement;Time measurement","birefringence;liquid crystal devices;microstrip lines;microstrip resonators;polymer dispersed liquid crystals","100 V;100 micron;50 micron;PDLC devices;decay time;delay lines;dielectric birefringence;microstrip line;microstrip resonators;microwave band dielectric properties;plain liquid crystal;polymer concentration;polymer dispersed liquid crystal devices;response time characteristics;rise time","","1","","6","","","12-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These sector errors are especially critical during RAID rebuilds because they can only be detected when the corresponding sectors are read. Mechanisms to cope with sector errors, therefore, have become an important way to improve disk reliability. One approach to deal with sector errors is the introduction of intra-disk redundancy, where additional redundancy blocks are calculated and stored for each set of disk sectors. Previous studies have introduced intra-disk redundancy schemes and have evaluated their impact on disk reliability. None of these studies has evaluated the influence on disk drive performance or the underlying energy consumption. The study presented in this paper benchmarks existing schemes concerning these metrics. It shows the surprising result that weaker codes combined with newly introduced scrambling techniques can produce faster layouts with similar reliability properties than previously proposed strong codes.","1526-7539","978-1-4577-0468-0","","10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005374","IDR;disk;energy consumption;evaluation;reliablity","Disk drives;Encoding;Energy consumption;Hard disks;Power measurement;Redundancy","RAID;disc drives;redundancy;reliability","RAID;disk drives;intradisk redundancy scheme;scrambling technique;sector errors;single disk reliability","","3","","25","","","25-27 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture of the sensor array reduces by more than half the silicon area of the DPS by sampling and storing the differential values between the pixel and its prediction, featuring compressed dynamic range and hence requiring limited precision (only 1-bit signed value in the proposed architecture as compared to 8-bit unsigned full precision). Hilbert scanning is used to read-out the pixel's value, hence avoiding discontinuity in the read-out path, which is shown to improve the quality of the reconstructed image. The Hilbert scanning path is all carried out by hardware wire connection without increasing the circuit complexity of the sensor array. Reset pixels are inserted into scanning path to overcome the error accumulation problem inherent in predictive coding. System level simulation results show a PSNR of around 25dB can be reached while using the proposed 1-bit Hilbert predictive coding algorithm.

It includes explicitly, and in a separate phase of the overall computation the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a non-holonomic vehicle. The algorithm has been designed to allow range and bearing information about unmapped obstacles to modify the actions of a robot-vehicle. The authors show some of the obstacle avoiding behaviour. Since the objects are unmapped they could be other moving vehicles. To overcome uncertainty in the actual movement the algorithm continually recomputes the control actions needed to achieve the goal.

If RPL only considers the reliability metric, nodes will suffer from uneven energy. If it only considers the energy metric, nodes will suffer from the rise of packet loss ratio. In this paper, we propose an energy-oriented routing mechanism to improve RPL routing protocol by combining the expected transmission count (ETX) and remaining energy metrics.

A random forest is constructed to efficiently generate discriminative votes from individual interest points, and a fast top-K subvolume search algorithm is developed to find all action instances in a single round of search. Without significantly degrading the performance, such a top-K search can be performed on down-sampled score volumes for more efficient localization.

Its financial construct allows for a shared risk and reward model. Using OBB model, the service provider earns its revenue upon meeting mutually agreed benchmarks that affect these key client business outcomes. An OBB engagement typically requires establishing a long-term relationship with the client and reduces the risk for the client during the business transformation. A key component of an OBB business model is its ability to determine the impact of a particular IT solution on the performance of client financial and operational metrics. We outline a systematic method to enable us to do so. We begin with a process to identify gaps in the client's financial or operational performance. Then, we identify the business drivers that can improve those gaps. Next, we map the prioritized business drivers to the underlying IT capabilities that impact these drivers, creating a causal relationship chart called a service value map. Based on the causal relationship between the IT capabilities and the prioritized business drivers, we identify the priorities of the IT capabilities for gap improvement. In the second part of the analysis, we assume that each high level business driver can be measured by a metric (key performance indicator). With the help of a heuristic approach, we estimate the change of the metric over time using the service value map. This is accomplished by: 1) creating two baselines that define the bounds of the metric, and 2) using a maturity analysis to quantify the impact of the IT capabilities over time.","","978-1-4799-5065-2","","10.1109/SCC.2014.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6930603","Business Capability;Gap Analysis;IT Capability;Outcome Based Business;Trade-Off","Benchmark testing;Companies;Couplings;Industries;Measurement;Support vector machines","business data processing;causality;information systems;statistical analysis","IT capabilities;OBB model;business transformation;causality analysis;maturity analysis;outcome-based business;service value map","","0","","8","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The asymmetrical bistable stage is taken up in detail, and analyzed with a view to determining its advantages and disadvantages. It is shown that this stage suffers from the inherent disadvantage that any improvement in the speed of turn-on results in a deterioration of the recovery characteristic. Furthermore, the switching requirements for turn-on and turn-off are dissimilar. A symmetrical version of this circuit is also presented; this circuit eliminates many of the disadvantages of the asymmetrical version, and also considerably speeds up the recovery characteristic without increasing the turn-on time.

First, the absolute-contrast is defined as the longest distance between peaks of the image's histogram, which is used to measure the whole contrast of the image. Second, aiming to simulate the perceive mechanism of human being, the spatial-contrast feature is proposed to describe the contrast difference between the area including the object and the entire image. Third, the algorithm of comparative high contrast area extraction based on spatial-contrast feature is developed. Finally, the method is verified by the text caption area extraction in video. The result shows that the new method is feasible and efficient. Because the spatial-contrast focuses on the feature related with regional contrast, it is qualified as a measure of salience in object recognition, which is free of the object shape and geometric transformation.

Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are ""template matching,"" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers.","0018-9219","","","10.1109/PROC.1985.13344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1457612","","Automatic speech recognition;Bayesian methods;Dynamic programming;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Natural languages;Power engineering and energy;Speech coding;Speech recognition;Stochastic processes","","","","58","4","145","","","Nov. 1985","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with authors of 120 SLRs published between 2004 and 2010 identified by three tertiary studies previously published. Results: Forty-four authors of SLR participate in the survey. The motivation behind the vast majority of the SLRs was to gather knowledge about a particular field of study. However, only six participants affirmed that their reviews actually had a direct impact in industrial practice. Conclusions: The use of SLR has increased over the years but they were mostly focused on academic problems and had very little impact on industrial practice.

Prolonged episodes of hyperglycemia elevate the risk of the patient developing diabetic complications, which makes infections such as common cold, influenza and influenza like illness more harmful for T1DM patients than the normal population. TTL, NST and AAU are researching a method of predicting illness in T1DM patients, using patient observable parameters. Daily BG measurements are identified as a relevant patient observable parameter, due to early rise when infected and elevated HbA<sub>1C</sub> during illness. A Smartphone based system is developed that allows patients to monitor BG concentrations and report symptoms of illness and illness. Data gathered by patients through use of this device, will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in daily BG measurements can be used to predict illness in T1DM patients, before symptoms onset. A successful prediction model will enable patients to get early indication of upcoming illness, before they are bedridden. Patients can thus actively take precautions to avoid or shorten illness episodes or make these less severe and/or have healthy BG concentrations during illness. This project is breaking new grounds by detecting illness before the onset of symptoms and illness, and an illness prediction model using patient observable parameters will be an important advance in the field of disease surveillance and prediction.","","978-1-4577-0786-5","","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2011.5940877","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940877","Blood Glucose;Bluetooth;Illness prediction;Infections;Mobile technology;Smartphones;Symptom detection;Telemedicine;Type 1 Diabetes","Blood;Diabetes;Diseases;Influenza;Monitoring;Predictive models;Sugar","diseases;medical computing;mobile radio;sugar;telemedicine","BG measurements;blood glucose concentrations;common cold infections;diabetic complications;disease prediction;disease surveillance;elevated HbA<sub>1C</sub>;hyperglycemia;illness prediction;illness risk detection;influenza infections;influenza like illness;mobile solution;smartphone based system;type 1 diabetes mellitus","","0","","13","","","Feb. 28 2011-March 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, operations that depend on and can potentially affect the state of the shared medium, such as admission control, require coordination and information sharing among these nodes. The CS range of wireless nodes is traditionally much larger than the reception range. Nodes that are outside reception range but within CS range can sense packet transmissions; however, they are unable to decode the packet contents. Direct messaging between these nodes is therefore not feasible for information sharing. In this paper, we describe two perceptive approaches for communication with nodes within CS range. Our approaches exploit the ability of a node to detect a change in the strength of the carrier signal when a transmission is in progress. Information is encoded in, and inferred from, perceptible transmission characteristics, such as the duration of a transmission or the silence between adjacent transmissions. This paper evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of our perceptive communication mechanisms on a hardware testbed. We implement a prototype of our solution on the Mica2 mote platform and test it in different network scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the durations of transmissions and silences can be correctly detected within a small margin of error in most situations, thus verifying the utility of our approach","","1-4244-0106-2","","10.1109/TRIDNT.2006.1649134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1649134","","Admission control;Decoding;Error correction;Hardware;Media Access Protocol;Prototypes;Testing;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;carrier sense multiple access;encoding;radio networks","CSMA-based MAC protocol;Mica2 mote platform;carrier sense multiple access;encoding;medium access control;perceptive communication mechanism;wireless node","","0","1","15","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A ramp metering implementation can present some problems to the adjacent arterial network. One source of these problems is the treatment of motorways and arterial network as two separate areas of control. This paper presents three novel methods for ramp metering. The three methods are aimed at promoting a coordinated, efficient and integrated ramp metering approach. These methods are integrated in the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) Ramp Metering System which currently controls the largest southern-hemisphere ramp metering network. The achievements of these methods are demonstrated by years of before and after field data from Auckland, New Zealand. An average 25% improvement in both congestion duration and traffic speed is achieved as well as an 8% increase in throughput. A total of 22% reduction in crashes is also demonstrated. Based on average results of 25 surveyed sites, the estimated annual benefits for a ramp metering site are a reduction of 26K hours of delay and a reduction of 6 crashes. In terms of economic value, this results in an estimated annual cost reduction of AU$2M per ramp metering site. These estimates were designed to exclude benefits from any civil works resulting in capacity increases to the motorway network.","","","","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958028","","Approximation methods;Delays;Detectors;Optimization;Reluctance motors;Roads;Vehicles","cost reduction;metering;road traffic control","Auckland;New Zealand;SCATS ramp metering;Sydney coordinated adaptive traffic system ramp metering system;arterial network;coordinated integrated ramp metering approach;cost reduction;dynamic traffic management tool;motorway network;southern hemisphere ramp metering network;traffic speed","","0","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the camera capturing the video is fixed with respect to the scene, detected motion will represent the target motion. However, when a camera in motion is used to capture the video, image registration at ground level is required to separate camera motion from target motion. An image registration method is introduced that is capable of registering images from different views of a 3-D scene in the presence of occlusion. The proposed method is capable of withstanding considerable occlusion and homogeneous areas in images. The only requirement of the method is for the ground to be locally flat and sufficient ground cover be visible in the frames being registered. Experimental results of 17 videos from the Brown University data set demonstrate robustness of the method in registering consecutive frames in videos covering various urban and suburban scenes. Additional experimental results are presented demonstrating the suitability of the method in registering images captured from different views of hilly and coastal scenes.","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2356177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910298","Aerial video;homography;image registration;multiview images;tracking","Cameras;Detectors;Feature extraction;Image registration;Image resolution;Registers;Target tracking","cameras;image motion analysis;image registration;image representation;object tracking;video signal processing","3D scene;Brown University data set;aerial image registration;camera motion;camera-scene relation;coastal scenes;consecutive frame registration;ground cover;hilly scenes;homogeneous areas;image registration method;locally flat ground;motion detection;moving target tracking;occlusion;suburban scenes;target motion representation;video capture;video frame registration","","0","","30","","2014-09-25","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Switching-time constraints are taken into account by imposing restrictions on the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the control sequence. The explicit solution to the constrained MPC problem is computed by solving a multi-parametric mixed integer linear program (mpMILP), where the parameters are the components of the state vector. The solution to the mpMILP is a piecewise affine (PWA) function, which can be evaluated at each sampling time to obtain the optimal control law.

Then within cluster scatter matrix can be computed. Substituting the within-class scatter matrix with the within-cluster matrix, we get a variant of the original LDA. Experimental results on FERET face databases show that the proposed method is promising.","","0-7803-9091-1","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527746","Face recognition;LDA;cluster;pattern classification","Face recognition;Hidden Markov models;Image generation;Image storage;Information processing;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Linear discriminant analysis;Matrices;Principal component analysis;Scattering","face recognition;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern clustering","FERET face databases;Fisher linear discriminant analysis;cluster-based LDA;face recognition;single sample problem;within-class scatter matrix;within-cluster matrix","","1","","","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far as our knowledge, the relatively existing packet scheduler schemes arrange the packets based on the corresponding delay time requirements for improving throughput or reducing dropping rate, not focus on deliberating how to reduce the delay time of packets efficiently as an important purpose. From this perspective, we have proposed our downlink delay-minimized scheduling (DDMS) algorithm for reducing the corresponding delay time for mobile stations (MSs) as our main contribution plus improves system throughput of the BS.

But now multi-touch input enables computer supported co-located collaborative work. Particularly, multi-touch tables seem promising to be beneficial for collaborative modeling sessions as sitting around a table supports discussions which can uncover misunderstandings. In this paper a collaborative business process modeling application is presented and evaluated in an empirical study.

As an emerging technology, an inexact circuit design offers a promising approach to significantly reduce both dynamic and static power dissipation for error tolerant applications. Although fixed-point arithmetic circuits have been studied in terms of inexact computing, floating-point arithmetic circuits have not been fully considered although require more power. In this paper, the first inexact floating-point adder is designed and applied to high dynamic range (HDR) image processing. Inexact floating-point adders are proposed by approximately designing an exponent subtractor and mantissa adder. Related logic operations including normalization and rounding modules are also considered in terms of inexact computing. Two HDR images are processed using the proposed inexact floating-point adders to show the validity of the inexact design. HDR-VDP is used as a metric to measure the subjective results of the image addition. Significant improvements have been achieved in terms of area, delay and power consumption. Comparison results show that the proposed inexact floating-point adders can improve power consumption and the power-delay product by 29.98% and 39.60%, respectively.","","","","10.1109/NANO.2014.6967953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967953","Floating-point adders;High-dynamic range image;Inexact computing;Low power","Adders;Dynamic range;Floating-point arithmetic;Hardware;Logic gates;Power demand","adders;floating point arithmetic;image processing;integrated circuit design;mobile computing","HDR-VDP;area consumption;current nanoscale integrated circuit design;delay consumption;exponent subtractor;floating-point arithmetic circuits;high dynamic range image processing;inexact circuit design;inexact computing;inexact floating-point adder;logic operations;low carbon economy;mantissa adder;mobile computing;normalization modules;power consumption;power-delay product;rounding modules","","0","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By performing a self-consistent 2D Monte Carlo simulation that dealt with both intrinsic and extrinsic device regions on an equal footing, we found for the first time that electron preheating in the source contact region enhances Γ-L intervalley transitions, significantly decreasing the average electron velocity in the intrinsic region. Based on the numerical results, the general criteria of the source contact structure are clarified to realise BFETs. Excellent BFET scaling properties are demonstrated in comparison with those of HEMTs. The average electron velocity of 20-nm-gate AlGaAs/GaAs BFETs was estimated to be 2.5 times larger than those reported for HEMTs fabricated on GaAs substrates","","0-7803-3130-3","","10.1109/EDMO.1996.575789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=575789","","Buffer layers;Electrodes;Electrons;Epitaxial layers;FETs;Gallium arsenide;HEMTs;Laboratories;MODFETs;Monte Carlo methods","III-V semiconductors;Monte Carlo methods;aluminium compounds;gallium arsenide;millimetre wave field effect transistors;nanotechnology;semiconductor device models","Γ-L intervalley transitions;20 nm;AlGaAs-GaAs;average electron velocity;electron preheating;electron velocity overshoot;extrinsic device regions;gate length;intrinsic device regions;inverse modulation-doped channel;millimetre-wave applications;nanoscale ballistic field effect transistors;scaling properties;self-consistent 2D Monte Carlo simulation;source contact;source contact structure","","0","","9","","","25-26 Nov 1996","25 Nov 1996-26 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For special cases, our approximation is seen to be consistent with the previously-obtained exact results for the M/G/1 queueing system with modified service mechanism, and it is further seen to be consistent with the previously-proposed approximate results for the GI/GI/1 queueing system with standard (H<sub>0</sub> = H<sub>1</sub>) service mechanism.","","978-1-4244-3942-3","978-1-4244-3941-6","10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345501","G/G/1;Queueing analysis;diffusion approximation;elementary return (ER) boundary;modified service mechanism;virtual waiting time process","Art;Business;Diffusion processes;Erbium;Informatics;Machinery;Performance analysis;Queueing analysis;System buses;Time measurement","approximation theory;queueing theory","diffusion approximation;modified service mechanism;performance measurement;service time distribution;single-server GI/G/1 queueing system;system idle;virtual waiting time process","","1","","32","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We aim to address this requirement by developing model-checking techniques for the (automatic or semiautomatic) verification of rational-agent systems written in a logic-based agent-oriented programming language. Typically, developers apply model-checking techniques to abstract models of a system rather than the system implementation. Although this is important for detecting design errors at an early stage, developers might still introduce errors during coding. In contrast, developers can directly apply our model-checking techniques to systems implemented in an agent-oriented programming language, automatically verifying agent systems without the usual gap between design and implementation. We developed our techniques for AgentSpeak, a rational-agent programming language based on the AgentSpeak (L) abstract agent-oriented programming language. AgentSpeak shares many features of the agent-oriented programming paradigm. Similarly, we've developed techniques for automatically translating AgentSpeak programs into the model specification language of existing model-checking systems. In this way, we reduce the problem of verifying that an AgentSpeak system has certain BDI logic properties to a conventional LTL model-checking problem.","1541-1672","","","10.1109/MIS.2004.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347068","Intelligent agents;model checking;multiagent systems","Automatic control;Automatic logic units;Computer languages;Computer science;Control systems;Dynamic programming;Java;Logic programming;Multiagent systems;Specification languages","formal verification;knowledge verification;mobile agents;multi-agent systems;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming","BDI logic property;agent-oriented programming language;formal verification;model-checking techniques;multiagent systems;property-based slicing;rational-agent systems;specification language","","14","","12","","","Sept.-Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, a brief system description illustrates how CoSRad is configured for interferometric meteor wind radar mode, where nearly all echoes originate from specular meteor trails. A schematic showing the primary CoSRad hardware setup provides context in interpreting the continuously-recorded data in RTI format. A visualization depicting CoSRad's all-sky specular echo detection strategy prepares us to examine a number of echoes observed during a recent campaign at Platteville, CO (Aug 20 - Sep 1). After a brief look at the canonical meteor trail echo, a number of ostensibly geophysical non-meteoric echoes are presented. In addition to their scientific interest, these echoes convey CoSRad's system capabilities. We first investigate non-specular echo occurrence rates as a function of k-vector geometry with respect to the earth's magnetic field (Oppenheim et. al. 2000, Close et. all. 2000). Next, specular trail echoes are interpreted with respect to Dimant and Oppenheim's (2006) theory predicting depletions in the background plasma surrounding meteor trails. Unlike earlier theories of meteor trail evolution, Dimant and Oppenheim consider the trail's interaction with the existing background ionosphere plasma. Their theory predicts that background plasma is drawn into the trail edges resulting in an electron depletion region around the trail. A number of echoes are presented containing a clear electron depletion region around the trail echo's perimeter. Instrumental effects are discussed and shown to be independent of the observed depletion regions. Finally, we show the depletion phenomenon's correlation with height and time of day. The talk concludes with how the CoSRad architecture has enable these measurements, and touches on how rapid and reconfigurable deployment enables CoSRad to perform similar measure- ent campaigns using many existing systems around the world.","","978-1-4673-4776-1","","10.1109/USNC-URSI-NRSM.2013.6525043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525043","","Aerospace engineering;Educational institutions;Geophysical measurements;Plasmas;Radar measurements;Software","diffusion;echo;ionosphere;meteors;radar interferometry;wind","CoSRad all-sky specular echo detection strategy;CoSRad architecture;CoSRad system capabilities;Colorado Software Define Radar system;RTI format;background ionosphere plasma;canonical meteor trail echo;continuously-recorded data;depletion phenomenon correlation;depletion regions;diffusion theory;earth magnetic field;electron depletion region;geophysical nonmeteoric echoes;instrumental effects;interferometric meteor wind radar mode;k-vector geometry;meteor trail evolution;meteor wind radar measurement campaign;nonspecular echo occurrence rates;primary CoSRad hardware setup;specular meteor trails;trail echo perimeter;trail edges;trail interaction","","0","","","","","9-12 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both acoustic amplitude and phase are recorded, allowing full calibration and determination of phases to within a single arbitrary constant. Results are presented of measurements at frequencies of 800-900 MHz, illustrating a multitude of normal mode behavior in electrically driven thin film acoustic resonators. Coupled with microwave electrical impedance measurements, this imaging mode provides an exceptionally fast method for evaluation of electric-to-acoustic coupling of these devices and their performance. Images of 256 /spl times/ 240 pixels are recorded at 18 fps rates synchronized to obtain both in-phase and quadrature detection of the acoustic motion.

"""Temperature measurements in optically pumped nonequilibrium plasmas by laser induced fluorescence of vibrationally excited carbon monoxide""","Lempert, W.R.; Leiweke, R.","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","Pulsed Power Plasma Science, 2001. IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts","20020807","2001","","","450","","Summary form only given. It is well known that CO laser ""optical pumping"" can be used to produce low translational temperature, non-equilibrium plasmas in high (/spl sim/1 bar) pressure mixtures of CO and common buffer species, such as nitrogen, argon, and/or helium. In this paper, we will present a new Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) thermometry technique, based on strong single photon allowed absorption from vibrationally excited (/spl nu/>7) levels of the ground electronic state of carbon monoxide. Optical pumping is a two-step process which combines resonant absorption of continuous wave CO laser radiation with anharmonic Vibration-Vibration energy exchange, producing non-equilibrium plasmas in the steady state. These plasmas are characterized by exceedingly high (and non-Boltzmann) vibrational mode disequilibrium, and low (/spl sim/400 K) to moderate (/spl sim/1000 K) rotational/translational. temperature. Electron production occurs by means of vibrational ""pooling"" collisions in which the sum of the vibrational energies of the colliding partners exceeds the threshold for ionization (/spl sim/33 quanta). In this highly vibrationally excited environment, strong single photon optical resonances exist to both the A and D' excited electronic states. In this paper we present proof-of-concept LIF temperature measurements in CO/Ar optically pumped mixtures. Rotational temperature determined by X/spl rarr/D' LIF is found to agree well (+/- 50 K) with temperature determined by FT-IR emission spectroscopy. Preliminary data employing X/spl rarr/A (4th positive system) LIF will also be presented as will modeling results illustrating the potential of two-dimensional (PLIF) temperature imaging.","","0-7803-7141-0","","10.1109/PPPS.2001.961214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961214","","Absorption;Argon;Optical buffering;Optical pumping;Plasma temperature;Plasma waves;Pump lasers;Resonance;Stimulated emission;Temperature measurement","excited states;fluorescence;optical pumping;plasma diagnostics;plasma temperature;rotational-vibrational energy transfer;spectral methods of temperature measurement","1 bar;400 to 1000 K;CO laser optical pumping;buffer species;laser induced fluorescence;laser induced fluorescence thermometry;low translational temperature;nonequilibrium plasmas;nonequilibrium plasmas pressure mixtures;optically pumping;temperature measurements;vibrationally excited carbon monoxide","","0","","","","","17-22 June 2001","17 Jun 2001-22 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of this, there is now a need to develop a theoretical understanding of the interactions between a forger using anti-forensics and a forensic investigator.

This paper proposes an improved space vector modulation (SVM) algorithm and a neutral point potential balancing technique for the inverter. Furthermore, a maximum power tracking controller for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is described in detail. The proposed SVM technique eliminates most of the computational burdens on the digital controller and renders a greater controllability under varying DC-link voltage conditions. The DC-link capacitor voltage balancing of both bulk and conditioning inverters is carried out using redundant state selection (RSS) method and is explained in detail. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed modulation and control techniques.","1553-572X","978-1-4244-4648-3","978-1-4244-4650-6","10.1109/IECON.2009.5414862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5414862","Multi-level converter;Neutral point potential balancing;PMSG;Redundant State Selection;Space Vector Modulation","Controllability;Digital control;Frequency;Inverters;Permanent magnets;Support vector machines;Switching loss;Synchronous generators;Voltage control;Wind energy generation","electric power generation;invertors;maximum power point trackers;permanent magnet generators;synchronous generators;wind power plants","DC link capacitor voltage;PMSG wind generation systems;cascade multilevel inverter;high frequency conditioning inverter;low power conditioning inverter;maximum power tracking controller;neutral point potential balancing;permanent magnet synchronous generator;redundant state selection;space vector modulation","","8","","","","","3-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 2003","20031103","2003","6","","5357","5362 vol.6","There are three paths for designing reduced order controllers: 1) model reduction followed by full-order design, 2) full-order design followed by controller reduction, and 3) direct reduced-order controller design. In general, path 1 does not yield the quality of controllers obtainable using paths 2 and 3; and path 2 does not necessarily yield optimal controllers. Path 3 usually uses descent methods to compute the controllers; the optimality of the resulting controllers depends on the initialization of these decent methods. Usually, controllers resulting from path 2 is used as initializations for path 3. Criteria for choosing path 2 methods for initialization descent methods of path 3 to yield low cost (preferably optimal) controller are not known. Since it is very difficult to establish an analytical solution to this problem, this paper seeks to supply reasonable answers via numerical experimentation. Three reduced order control design problems that appear in the existing literature are investigated. It is seen that because of the prevalence of numerous local minima the best results are not always obtained by initializing a quasi-Newton algorithm of path 3 with a low cost controller. In addition, one of the simplest indirect methods, the modified balanced truncation, often results in the best ""optimal"" controllers.","0743-1619","0-7803-7896-2","","10.1109/ACC.2003.1242580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242580","","Control design;Cost function;Design methodology;Design optimization;Error correction;Mechanical engineering;Optimal control;Process design;Reduced order systems;Testing","control system synthesis;optimal control;reduced order systems","H<sub>2</sub> optimal controller design method;controller reduction;descent method;direct reduced-order controller design;full-order design;model reduction;modified balanced truncation;parameter optimization;plant model reduction;quasiNewton algorithm;reduced order controller","","0","","12","","","4-6 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the future, all power users, whether they are commercial, industrial, or residential, are expected to demand more reliability from the electric power-delivery system than ever before. The future of the power industry will require the continued development and integration of two infrastructures, not just one: both power delivery and communications. Significant investments in the bulk-supply system and customer-side equipment will be needed to determine optimal solutions to digital end users' SQRA requirements, but it is not clear at this stage what balance of investment in the supply side versus the customer side is required to most cost effectively meet the needs of the growing digital-power market.

An abstract level hardware implementation of the most matured Narrowband (NB) PHY operating at 2.4 GHz ISM band among the three PHY layers defined by the standard is proposed. Major building blocks of PHY transceiver such as CRC, spreader, interleaver and scrambler were individually designed and integrated. To avoid the inherent limitation of the data transmission and to achieve higher reliability especially for medical applications, BCH (63, 51, 2) encoder and decoder is integrated to the design. Before modulation, spreading technique is employed and supports pi/2 DBPSK modulation. The transceiver achieves a data rate of 121.4 kbps and packet size of 256 bits. The design has been simulated in Questa 10.1.d, synthesized in Xilinx ISE 14.4 and successfully implemented and tested on ML605 Evaluation Board through PCIe interface.

In order to find interesting patters, we introduce text analysis into the formal concept analysis(FCA) field. FCA is a valid tool for data mining and knowledge processing. In the paper, we present a method for extracting the conceptual patterns and concept lattice from multiple knowledge sources. The method consists of two steps: the first is to insert some related many-valued contexts (MVCs) (which represent text knowledge) into some corresponding column or cell of other MVC in accordance with certain rules, and then extract formal concepts and concept lattice. Our insertion method not only is semantic-preserving, but adds the dimension of attributes for describing objects. Hence, the discovered concepts have the more richer intents and are more denser in the concept lattice. The paper mainly applied the method to column insertion operation and cell insertion operation, and obtained some propositions, which can be used by knowledge engineers to represent and analyze text knowledge (especially, text objects) and to extract new semantics information or associate rules from concept lattices.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5305385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305385","","Artificial intelligence;Bismuth;Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information analysis;Knowledge engineering;Lattices;Text analysis","data analysis;data mining;fuzzy set theory;knowledge representation;text analysis","FCA;MVC;association rule extraction;cell insertion operation;column insertion operation;concept discovery;concept lattice extraction;conceptual pattern extraction;data mining;formal concept analysis;fuzzy value;knowledge engineering;knowledge processing;many-valued context;multiple knowledge source;semantic information extraction;semantic-preserving insertion method;text knowledge analysis approach;text knowledge representation","","0","","9","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While progress has been made using several circuit and system level techniques, a fundamental approach that considers the signal's spectral properties is lacking. In this paper, we re-evaluate the oversampling problem: we use a time-domain analysis to show that given a signal spectrum, quantization noise is decreased under certain discrete-time filtering operations. Using this alternate approach, a collection of ADC architectures are constructed, special cases of which, reduce to well-known data conversion techniques in literature. Analysis and simulations confirm comparable performance of the proposed ADCs with other oversampled ADCs such as Δ-Σ modulators. When additional information about signal energy distribution is available, it is shown that the proposed ADC architectures are adaptable on a system level, thus surpassing the performance of Δ-Σ modulation.

We report on investigations to replace the spark gaps by thyristors. First tests with the application of phase-controlled thyristors showed that the decices should have a fine structured gate at their disposal to enable the high current rate typical for pulsed power applications. Because of this, experiments were made with a pulse power thyristor developed by ABB and with a modified fast switching thyristor. The pulse power thyristor has the gate structure of a GTO device, but in contrast to a GTO, it is not possible to switch it off. Furthermore a modified fast switching thyristor was investigated due to pulse power applications. The device has a blocking voltage of 3 kV and, in contrast to a normal fast switching thyristor, it is not irradiated. By this step the charge carrier lifetime can be increased.","","0-7803-1415-8","","10.1109/PPC.1993.513639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=513639","","Current density;Inductance;Power semiconductor switches;Railguns;Semiconductivity;Semiconductor diodes;Spark gaps;Testing;Thyristors;Voltage","","","","12","","9","","","21-23 June 1993","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first is that the planning methodologies in use by the American business community roughly parallel those in use by the US intelligence community (IC). Both face the problem sets of rapid context and process changes. The second, based on the first, is that planning is NOT a bad word in business - it is the business. Context drives market requirements; market requirements drive both technology and product (service) development; and resulting market-driven solutions drive both cash flows and profitability. In both, the need for internal control creates the underlying decision networks that define the pathways and alignment necessary to comprehend and communicate operational requirements and constraints. In the business community, the underlying marketing, product, and technology decision sets identify common needs across the corporation and create organization and strategy development and execution processes. Strategy decisions both generate and consume requirements, thereby creating (and destroying) value. Given the accelerating pace of change in the environment, the planning processes become both more critical and require more rigor. The potential value destruction of ill-considered propositions and investments may risk organizational survival. With these stated assumptions as a baseline, the authors begin to explore first applications of full-spectrum analysis in the global business environment where, like the IC, the participants can never have more than a passing advantage. Faced with rapidly changing global contexts; dissimilar standards of ethics and conduct; information overload, conflict, and obsolescence; fierce competition (including new and non-traditional competitors); multiuse and breakthrough technologies, etc., participants must pursue relentless improvement to create and address ever- present capability and operational mismatches.

This was done by using very large gate currents to trigger the devices and by using a saturable magnetic component in series with the thyristors. The large gate signals turned on more of the cathode region and the saturable component allowed time for more lateral spreading of the conducting region once the thyristors were triggered. When thyristors are triggered into conduction, the voltage across them collapses and is transferred to the magnetic material. The domains in the material begin to align according to the small magnetizing current flowing. Most of the domains align after a short period of time, so that this saturation of the material (switching) allows the thyristors time to turn on more completely. As the voltage collapses across the saturable material the current rises quickly to its peak to complete the closing of the switch.

It realizes output voltage regulation by employing high- and low-frequency control pulses with preset switching frequencies. At the beginning of each control pulse cycle, the output voltage is sampled and compared with reference voltage to determine whether high- or low-frequency control pulse should be generated as control pulse. Compared with conventional pulse-width-modulation-based PCM control (hereafter called PCM-PWM), which realizes output voltage regulation by adjusting the duty ratio of the control pulse cycle by cycle, the PCM-BF control is simple, cost effective, and enjoys fast transient response. Moreover, more low-frequency control pulses are generated for light load, which improve the power conversion efficiency at light load. Besides, high- and low-frequency control pulses with different switching frequencies spread the spectrum over discrete frequencies, resulting in low electromagnetic interference. A buck converter operating in the DCM is taken as an example to illustrate the applications and benefits of the PCM-BF control technique.

We also present the dependence of vehicle speed statistics on both the node isolation probability as well as the critical transmission range required to maintain the desired connectivity probability. The results show that when the vehicle transmission range increases, the network connectivity also gets increased. The results also show that the network connectivity gets degraded when the average vehicle speed increases. Further, as the average speed increases, the critical transmission range required to meet a given connectivity probability criterion increases. On the other hand, when the standard deviation of vehicle speed increases, the network connectivity gets improved. It is also shown that, for a given connectivity probability requirement, the critical transmission range decreases as the standard deviation of the speed increases.","","978-1-4244-9798-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739311","Connectivity;critical transmission range;highway;vehicle speed;vehicular ad hoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Computational modeling;Mobile computing;Vehicles","probability;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET;connectivity probability criterion;critical transmission range;network connectivity analytical model;node isolation probability;one-dimensional vehicular ad hoc network;vehicle speed statistics","","5","","16","","","10-12 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The boundary conditions are continuity of currents at sparking and a residual condenser charge experimentally determined. Calculated current and voltage waves for a special case are compared with an oscillogram taken for the same transformer constants. A number of curves illustrating the quantities studied (and also curves facilitating their computation) are given; and, on comparison, are found to agree closely with oscillograms taken during actual operation. On the basis of the derived theory, a complete set of transformer measurements are explained, and numerical illustrations given. The effect of harmonic components in the e.m.f., and the avoidance of their effects are explained, together with the effect of the wave form of the e.m.f. In connection with the experimental verification of the theory, there are described the necessary measuring apparatus, including the oscillographs. The design of the transformer to meet any desired requirements is then treated in detail from the theoretical and practical standpoints. The use of air core power transformers at frequencies of 500 cycles and over is considered and found to be feasible.

One of the advantages of NFSDs is their read/write bandwidth, which is higher than that of the magnetic storage devices. For further increase of their bandwidth, high-end NFSDs employ multichannel and multi-way architectures in which it is possible to access the NAND flash memories (NFMs) in parallel for amortizing the long latency of NFMs. Even though this architecture provides higher bandwidth from the hardware perspective, the overall performance of an NFSD critically depends on how efficiently the multiple channels and ways are utilized. In this regard, the key design component is an intermediate software layer called flash translation layer (FTL), since it manages the hardware resources as well as data. To the best of authorsiquest knowledge, this is the first work to propose a general method to design an FTL for multichannel / multi-way NFSDs (FTL-MM). The proposed design method consists of two steps. First, we design an FTL for a single-channel / single-way NFSD (FTL-SS). Second, we extend the FTL to support an NFSD with an arbitrary number of channels and ways. To prove the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply the method to three well-known FTLs. The experimental results indicate that the FTLs enhanced by our approach are comparable to the ideal FTL and that their performance is scalable to various channel / way architectures. Quantitatively speaking, the average channel utilization decreases by at most 10%, when we increase the number of channels and ways up to four.","0098-3063","","","10.1109/TCE.2009.5278005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5278005","Flash Translation Layer (FTL);Multi-channel;Multi-way;NAND Flash Memory (NFM);storage","Application software;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Costs;Delay;Design methodology;Hardware;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic memory;Resource management","NAND circuits;flash memories","NAND flash memories;flash translation layer;flash translation layers;hardware resources;magnetic storage devices;multichannel NAND flash-based storage devices;multichannel multi-way NFSD;single-channel single-way NFSD","","12","","12","","","August 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Now, we focus on a global positioning system (GPS), which is a global SE that gives users or robots their positions whenever and wherever they are outdoors all over the world. GPS will strongly support robot self-positioning. However, GPS has the problem that it cannot be used when the robots are indoors. To solve this problem, we experimentally mounted four pseudolites ('pseudo' means imitated and 'lite' means satellite) in our laboratory and developed indoor GPS. The system worked well unless the robot was near the wall, where cycle slip often occurred. To examine the characteristics and reason for cycle slip, we measured the radio-wave environment in the laboratory. The first half of this paper introduces this system.

Feedthrough logic can improve the performance by partial evaluation in its computational block before getting a valid input. The FTL is more suited for those circuits which consists of a critical path of large cascaded inverting gates. FTL based circuits can perform better in both high fan-out and high frequency operations due to both dynamic power consumption and lower delay at the cost of area. The proposed circuit achieves a reduction in the average power. The comparison analysis has been carried out by simulating the logic circuit by 180 nm technology. The proposed modified FTL reduces total power consumption up to 13.25% in wide fan-in NAND gates and 99.9% in wide fan-in NOR gates. This model works more effectively in the case of NOR gates but creates more delay as compared to other proposed FTL models.","","978-1-4799-5990-7","","10.1109/SPIN.2015.7095316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095316","Feedthrogh logic (FTL);dynamic CMOS logic;high performane;low power;wide fan-in gates","Clocks;Delays;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;MOSFET;Power dissipation","CMOS logic circuits;circuit simulation;delay circuits;integrated circuit design;logic gates;low-power electronics","CMOS logic;delay;dynamic power consumption;logic circuit simulation;low power circuit;low power dynamic feedthrough logic;size 180 nm;wide fan-in NAND gates;wide fan-in NOR gates","","0","","","","","19-20 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, all students cannot make exactly the same contribution as each other, so a system to allocate marks for individual's contribution has been previously developed and employed within the school. This system is called the Fair Contribution Sheet (FCS) and a paper-based form has been developed and deployed within these subjects for many years. This paper outlines the FCS system and describes the development of an electronic form based equivalent, which was first deployed in 2010. The deployed system was developed using Java and Java Server pages (JSP). A survey of students, who used this software, was conducted. Some of these students had previously used the paper-based FCS and their perception of the differences between the electronic and paper based versions, along with other results, are presented in this paper.

Meaningful PD measurement can obtain reliable information on the condition of sealing ends and joints after installation or several years of operation which can contribute to considerable overall reduction of error risk. The UHF (ultra high frequency) method is an effective PD detection method. It shows out the superiority in measurement sensitivity and suppressing interference. It has been confirmed that the frequency of the PD pulse generated in cables can reach up to GHz, while the frequency of background noise usually lies below 400 MHz. Experiments show that the UHF PD pulse can radiate from the disconnection between the shields in the sealing ends or the joints, and it can also radiate out along the ground wire or the cross-linked wire. Moreover, the detection by UHF sensor towards four different types of PD models have been done in laboratory, such as sliding discharge model, floating discharge model, protrusion discharge model and cavity discharge model. Mass of statistic results of these PD pulses indicate the distinct characteristics. It can help to do the pattern recognition research, even to do further research on fault diagnosis for XLPE cables.","","0-7803-9257-4","","10.1109/CEIDP.2005.1560714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560714","","Background noise;Cables;Frequency;Interference suppression;Partial discharge measurement;Partial discharges;Pulse generation;Testing;UHF measurements;Wire","UHF detectors;XLPE insulation;cable insulation;cable jointing;cable testing;fault diagnosis;insulation testing;interference suppression;partial discharge measurement;pattern recognition;seals (stoppers)","PD detection;PD measurement;UHF sensor method;XLPE cables accessory;cable testing;cavity discharge model;cross-linked wire;error risk reduction;fault diagnosis;floating discharge model;ground wire;interference suppression;joint;measurement sensitivity;partial discharge monitoring;pattern recognition;protrusion discharge model;pulse generation;sealing;sliding discharge model;statistic result","","2","","7","","","16-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are not many approaches from the channel doping process. In the usual MOSFET structures, the highly doped channel implanted regions are localized under the gate by the mask used in the channel implantation step in order to reduce Cj. In this process, however, it is limited to localize the channel implanted region by the requirement of the margin for the mask misalignment in the photolithography process. Hence, Cj remained a serious problem to realize the high speed and low power operation. On the other hand, the importance of low frequency noise in RF and microwave circuit applications have been also increased. The authors show the gate length dependence of low frequency noise of MOSFETs. The spectral density of the drain current noise (SID) increases as the gate length decreased. This low frequency noise can be reduced by decreasing the dose of channel implantation process. However it is very difficult to suppress the low frequency noise with optimizing threshold voltage simultaneously. One of the reasons for higher 1/f noise at higher Vth is estimated to be due to the larger damage caused by larger dose of the channel implantation as explained later. The main object of this paper is the investigation of a self-align doped channel (SADC) structure as one of the candidates which can reduce the low frequency noise and the parasitic capacitance simultaneously. In the SADC process, the channel doping process is carried out by using solid phase diffusion from the gate, hence the doped region is fully sell-aligned to the gate, and the junction capacitance can be reduced. Moreover the implantation damage in the channel is reduced. We examine the feasibility study of SADC structure and demonstrate high performance 0.25 /spl mu/m gate length nMOSEFTs with low noise and l- w power consumption by using SADC structure.","","0-7803-4770-6","","10.1109/VLSIT.1998.689215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=689215","","Circuit noise;Doping;Lithography;Low-frequency noise;MOSFET circuits;Microwave circuits;Parasitic capacitance;Radio frequency;Solids;Threshold voltage","1/f noise;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;MOS analogue integrated circuits;MOSFET;capacitance;integrated circuit noise;ion implantation;masks;photolithography","0.25 mum;MOSFETs;SADC process;Vth;analog CMOS;channel implantation;channel implantation process;channel implanted region;drain current noise;drain junction capacitance;drain structures;gate length;gate length dependence;high speed;highly doped channel implanted regions;implantation damage;junction capacitance;low frequency noise;low l/f noise;low power;low power operation;mask;mask misalignment;microwave circuit applications;nMOSEFTs;optimizing threshold voltage;parasitic capacitance;self-align doped channel;self-align doped channel structure;solid phase diffusion;spectral density","","1","","4","","","9-11 June 1998","09 Jun 1998-11 Jun 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model takes into account the Hurter-Driffield density versus log exposure characteristic to estimate image intensity errors caused by exposure inconsistencies. The model is shown to be highly nonlinear and can accommodate typical grayscale manipulations performed during film-to-video transfers. Motivated by the above model, an algorithm for the estimation of a correction profile across the available grayscale is developed. This profile is obtained from histogrammed gray-level differences between a reference and a degraded frame and is robust with respect to intensity changes due to scene and camera motion. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective toward removing flicker for a variety of archived sequences and compares favorably with other state-of-the-art techniques developed for the same purpose. Additionally, the parametric form of the profile makes it particularly suitable for metadata use and allows fast inversion of the restoration process and recovery of the original material.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.825559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281824","","Cameras;Degradation;Gray-scale;Helium;Image restoration;Layout;Robustness;Spatial resolution;TV;Video coding","cinematography;error analysis;image motion analysis;image restoration;image sequences","Hurter-Driffield density;archived film sequences;error estimation;exposure inconsistencies;film-to-video transfers;first principles;flicker correction;grayscale manipulations;histogrammed gray-level differences;image intensity;image recovery;image restoration;log exposure characteristic;metadata;nonlinear model","","11","","9","","","April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The dynamics of lateral interaction between neural units generates well-localized areas of high neural activation, which can be easily detected and used for behavior selection. The major focus of this paper is to drastically reduce the computational expense for the application of two-dimensional DNF. For that purpose, the dynamics of DNF is transformed into a space-variant field representation, defining a new type of DNF, namely space-variant dynamic neural fields (SVDNF).

As systems (of systems) grow both increasingly pervasive and complex, defending them from attack or mischance at the systems of systems level becomes ever more challenging. We propose moving some security monitoring tasks from software to hardware which will allow real time detection of intrusions and errors. Our flexible architecture uses re configurable logic (such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)) and operates in parallel with a general purpose computing environment. To that end, new hardware primitives are proposed that allow for gathering and monitoring the state of the main processor transparently (that is, the main processor is unaware of the monitoring) in real time. The result is a decrease in workload for the main processor while enhancing security. The monitoring primitives are tightly coupled with the monitored software, and can readily and automatically respond to changes in system characteristics such as new software applications or devices. By focusing on specific system components, including their interface with other system components, we believe we can enhance system of system security in ways not readily achievable using conventional, system-wide monitoring techniques.","","1-4244-1159-9","1-4244-1160-2","10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4304258","","Computer architecture;Computerized monitoring;Concurrent computing;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Programmable logic arrays;Real time systems;Security","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;system monitoring;systems analysis","field programmable gate arrays;flexible real-time parallel intrusion detection;hardware-based architecture;security monitoring tasks;system security;system-wide monitoring;systems of systems level","","0","","18","","","16-18 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods: Different concentrations of n-butanol extraction layers of Geranium Wilfordii were used to affect HepG<sub>2</sub> cells cultured in vitro. SRB assay was used to determine inhibition rate of cell growth, and flow cytometry assay was used to determine apoptosis. Fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM was used to observe changes of concentration of intracellular calcium ion of tumor cells, and flow cytometry was used to determine changes of intracellular active oxygen species of tumor cells. Results: n-butanol extraction layer could significantly inhibit growth of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells and induce occurrence of apoptosis, and the IC50 was 83.51 ug/ml. After effects of n-butanol extraction layer for 48h, the amount of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells significantly reduced. Under the effect of Fluo-3/AM fluorescent probe, stronger green fluorescence appeared.

The proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case, the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel. A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel.","","1-4244-1564-0","1-4244-1564-0","10.1109/ITW.2007.4313097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4313097","","AWGN;Additive white noise;Channel coding;Communication system security;Error correction codes;Lakes;Memoryless systems;Parity check codes;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless communication","error correction codes;radiocommunication;telecommunication security","binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel;eavesdropper channel;noiseless channel;secure coding design;secure error-correcting code;secure nested code;type II wiretap channels","","34","1","18","","","2-6 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The enhanced vibration signal is then divided into segments corresponding to individual tooth mesh durations, and Discrete Fourier Transform is performed to each signal segment respectively, giving a series of tooth-related amplitude and phase spectra. A crack in a gear is identified through tooth-by-tooth comparison of the spectrum components of the same frequency from the spectrum series.

Mining such patterns offers a key means of insight into transcription regulation mechanisms and becomes a useful primitive task underlying many researches and applications. Recently, various methods have been developed to identify biological patterns. However, traditional approaches to mine sequential pattern will get a huge result set, which make biologists difficult to decide which patterns are interesting and meaningful. In this paper, we study a variant of biological sequential pattern mining aiming at the huge result set, termed top k representative patterns mining based on regularity measurement. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, a new measurement `regularity' is defined to evaluate the interesting of each pattern and an efficient algorithm is proposed with pruning strategy which returns top k representative patterns ranked by the regularity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art methods on the real datasets.","","978-1-4244-8303-7","978-1-4244-8304-4","10.1109/BIBMW.2010.5703813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703813","biological sequence;data mining;functional element;sequential pattern","","biology computing;data mining;pattern formation","TOPPER;biological sequential patterns;pruning;regularity measurement;top k pattern mining;transcription regulation","","0","","16","","","18-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All system attributes in terms of spatial resolution and detection depth have been theoretically calculated. Phantom experimentation as well as human tests using single frequency receivers, have shown promising outcome concerning the potential clinical value of the proposed system, which seems to be able to pick-up brain activation, possibly caused by cortex conductivity changes.

In the present paper, a method for retrieving the conductivity variation profile detected in the above mentioned frequencies is discussed. The inverse problem solution is in detail addressed and indicative measurements are used for the validation of the solution in question.

Static electrical contacts between metals initially take place through small asperities, or ""a-spots"", distributed over the contact area. The voltage developed across the interface is directly related to the contact temperature and force, the number of a-spots, the thermophysical and mechanical properties of the contacting materials, the current history, and any interfacial materials that may be present. To physically simulate some of the conditions attained within a railgun, a pulsed current static electrical contact experimental facility has been developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. This facility employs a 500-kN capacity servohydraulic load frame equipped with an electrically insulated load train to establish a contact force on interfaces between metals through which a pulsed current is transmitted. The time dependent evolutions of the voltage drops across the interfaces, as detected by probes pushed into the contacting materials, are recorded during a 40-kA peak current pulse having a 300-mus rise time with peak current densities on the order of 50 kA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The interface stack is assembled from a 12-mm outside diameter annular disk of metal with a 6.3-mm hole which is compressed between two hollow pedestals of a second metal. The evolution of the voltage drop across an interface during a pulse will be described as a function of initial contact pressures, current density, and polarity for dissimilar (Al/Cu) metal contacts.

Recently, however, a phenomenon called flaming or backlash becomes an imminent problem to private companies. A flaming incident is usually triggered by thoughtless comments/actions on SNS, and it sometimes ends up damaging to the company's reputation seriously. In this paper, in order to prevent such unexpected damage to the company's reputation, we propose a new approach to sentiment analysis using a Naïve Bayes classifier, in which the features of tweets/comments are selected based on entropy-based criteria and an empirical rule to capture negative expressions. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach to relabeling noisy training data, which come from various SNS media such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs and a Japanese textboard called `2-channel'. In the experiments, we use four data sets of users' comments, which were posted to different SNS media of private companies. The experimental results show that the proposed Naïve Bayes classifier model has good performance for different SNS media, and a semi-supervised learning effectively works for the data consisting of long comments. In addition, the proposed method is applied to detect flaming incidents, and we show that it is successfully detected.","","","","10.1109/CIBD.2014.7011523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011523","","Companies;Dictionaries;Entropy;Media;Semisupervised learning;Support vector machines;Training data","Bayes methods;entropy;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","2-channel;Facebook;Japanese textboard;SNS media;Twitter;backlash;blogs;comments feature selection;communication tools;company reputation;entropy-based criteria;flaming incident detection;naive Bayes classifier model;noisy training data;semisupervised learning approach;sentiment analysis;tweets feature selection","","0","","13","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finding network topologies, practical scenarios, and limits on graphs applicable for NPC are of interest. In this paper, we establish limits on network protection design. We investigate several network graphs where NPC can be deployed using network coding.

To obtain a high SNR image without lengthy repeated scans, post processing of data such as denoising plays a critical role. Bilateral and Nonlocal means (NLm) filtering are commonly used procedures for medical image denoising. In this paper we propose a new thresholding scheme to wavelet and contour let based denoising by introducing a scaling factor to universal threshold. Also we propose the aforementioned novel contour let thresholding scheme as a preprocessing step on bilateral filtering and NLm denoising. Simulation results show that the proposed single entity comprising the novel preprocessing step and bilateral or NLm denoising is superior in terms of PSNR and perceptual quality compared to Bilateral filtering or NLm denoising used alone.","","","","10.1109/ICACC.2013.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686367","Bilateral filtering;Contourlet transform;Denoising;Non Local means denoisng;visushrink;wavelet transform","Biomedical imaging;Filter banks;Noise;Noise reduction;Wavelet transforms","filtering theory;image denoising;medical image processing;wavelet transforms","NLm filtering;PSNR;SNR image;bilateral filtering;contour let based denoising;contour let thresholding scheme;medical image denoising;noise reduction;nonlocal means filtering;perceptual quality;scaling factor;signal-to-noise ratio;universal threshold;wavelet based denoising","","0","","26","","","29-31 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new method uses an oscilloscope for the measurement of resonator parameters, such as resonant frequency, Q value and coupling coefficient, which are necessary for WPT design. Because they are calculated from voltage variation measured by an oscilloscope, the method is free from 50 ohm condition. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for WPT system design with 0 ohm power source and various load resistances.","","978-1-4673-1777-1","","10.1109/IMWS.2012.6215786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215786","Coupled resonators;Oscilloscope;System design;Transmission efficiency;Wireless power transfer","Coils;Couplings;Electrical resistance measurement;Frequency measurement;Oscilloscopes;Resonant frequency;Spirals","band-pass filters;electric resistance;load (electric);network analysers;oscilloscopes;power measurement;radiofrequency power transmission;resonators;voltage measurement","2-stage band-pass filter theory;VNA;WPT system design;WPT system measurement;input-output resistance;load resistances;oscilloscope;resonator parameter measurement;voltage variation measurement;wireless power transfer","","0","","4","","","10-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The value of coordinating production with distribution is investigated. The objective is to minimize the sum of setup production costs, holding costs and distribution costs on the planning horizon. An iterative approach is developed for this NP-hard problem. A first production plan is obtained using integer linear programming and the distribution plan (set of vehicle trips in each period) is built using a tabu search metaheuristic that does not change the production plan. In the following iteration, an improved production plan is first determined considering the distribution plan of the previous interaction as a constraint. Then, a new distribution plan is computed given the new production plan. This iterative process stops when the two plans become stable. The iterative method is evaluated on a set of randomly generated instances. The impact of various parameters is evaluated. A comparison with a classical two-phase method shows significant savings ranging from 3.50% to 27.73%. These results underline the relevance of integrating distribution and production planning decisions","","1-4244-0450-9","1-4244-0451-7","10.1109/ICSSSM.2006.320625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114445","Production planning;coordination;tabu search;vehicle routing","Capacity planning;Costs;Iterative methods;Manufacturing;NP-hard problem;Optimized production technology;Production planning;Routing;Supply chains;Vehicles","integer programming;linear programming;production planning;search problems;transportation","NP-hard problem;integer linear programming;production distribution;production optimization;production planning;tabu search","","0","","","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To eliminate safety threat that is mostly caused by vehicle-to-vehicle collisions, technologies and methodologies of cooperative vehicle infrastructure system provide sufficient capabilities for a vehicle to share relevant information with other connected neighborhood vehicles, then identify and avoid potential collisions. In the design of collision avoidance solution, precise vehicle location is the most essential but enabling factor to support vehicle situation perception and collision avoidance decisions, which promotes location-based solutions for collision avoidance using real-time information of enhanced location from connected vehicles with wireless communication links. In this paper, a multi-sensor integration approach is presented with a GPS/DR structure where lane-level roadmap database for assistance is also integrated. A four-stage framework is designed to accomplish effective conflict resolution and safety assurance. Key issues including multi-sensor fusion with map match and the location-based collision avoidance mechanism are discussed. Simulation with field data in a real intersection environment is carried out, and the results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach with low-cost and simple configuration.","","978-1-4673-4705-1","","10.1109/ICCVE.2012.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519580","collision avoidanc;cooperative safety;multisensor integration;unsignalized intersection;vehicle locating","","collision avoidance;radio links;road safety;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing;transportation","GPS/DR structure;collision avoidance decision;conflict resolution;cooperative vehicle infrastructure system;four-stage framework;lane-level roadmap database;location-based collision avoidance mechanism;location-based cooperative vehicle collision avoidance;map match;multisensor fusion;multisensor integration approach;road transportation;safety assurance;safety threat elimination;unsignalized intersection;vehicle situation perception;vehicle-to-vehicle collision;wireless communication link","","0","","12","","","12-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is based on the hyperimage concept which describes the response of scatterers as a function of the observation angle, of the emitted frequency and of the polarimetric decomposition. New polarimetric hyperimages point out a non-stationary behavior which can be interpreted by the physics parameters of the target (geometrical shape, relative orientation). They allow a best understanding of the scattering mechanisms. Basic statistics extracted from these representations show that they are tools to detect non-stationary scatterers and are the first step to a new classification.","","0-7803-9496-8","","10.1109/RADAR.2006.1631794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631794","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Dispersion;Image analysis;Image sensors;Physics;Radar imaging;Radar polarimetry;Radar scattering;Synthetic aperture radar;Time frequency analysis","radar imaging;radar polarimetry;scattering;time-frequency analysis","anisotropic scatterer;deterministic target;dispersive scatterer;hyperimage concept;physics parameter;polarimetric coherent decomposition;radar imaging;radar sensor;scattering mechanism;time-frequency analysis","","3","","11","","","24-27 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We believe that these problems can be reduced significantly by integrating the federated identity architecture into the context-aware services. With this aim, we have developed a framework for Context-Aware Federated Services based on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) standards. We have illustrated the applicability of our approach by showcasing some use-cases, analysed the security, privacy and trust issues involved in the framework and the advantages it offers.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011243","Attribute Aggregation;Context-Aware Services;Federated Identity Management;GeoXACML;SAML;XACML","Authentication;Authorization;Context;Context-aware services;Databases;Privacy","authorisation;data privacy;ubiquitous computing","CAFS;SAML;XACML;context-aware federated services;extensible access control markup language;federated identity management;privacy issues;security assertion markup language;security issues","","0","","43","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HHWDC uses the k-means algorithm for local solution improvement strategy, and based on the Bayesian Information Criteria is able to automatically define the number of clusters.

We propose a solution that handles irrationalities by generating different hypotheses of the environment and testing these for their validity thereby fully automating the abductive loop. By assuming the irrational view, we focus on a fundamental change in relation to existing formal techniques that have been developed over the past decades for dealing with uncertain information. While other methods assume a set of axioms to describe the basic building blocks of the problem domain and use these to build concepts. The new approach, unlike the requirements of a rational system, has no predefined problem domain concepts and any concept can be generated and selected based on their ability to be useful in fulfilling the purpose. This means a completely dynamic ontology is generated and maintained. In this way the proposed system could probably cope with any type of problem domain.","","1-4244-0099-6","1-4244-0100-3","10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273799","","Automatic testing;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Cybernetics;Data structures;Humans;Machine intelligence;Man machine systems;Ontologies;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);uncertainty handling","abductive inference loop;dynamic ontology;formal techniques;problem domain concepts;uncertain information;uncertainty handling","","0","","16","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Power control is an important issue in wireless networks, which still has no satisfactory solution. Due to the limited amount of power available to wireless units, there is a need for systems that operate with reduced power consumption levels. We propose a new model for the problem, that exploits the relationship among necessary power and reach of broadcast. The resulting model is called the power control problem in ad hoc networks (PCADHOC). We derive a linear integer programming model, which is used to find lower bounds on the amount of required power. The constraints of the problem guarantee that all required transmissions can be successfully performed. A distributed algorithm based on variable neighborhood search is proposed to solve the PCADHOC. The results of experiments with the algorithm show that the power savings are considerable.","","0-7695-2132-0","","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303184","","Ad hoc networks;Electrical equipment industry;Energy consumption;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Personal digital assistants;Power control;Power system modeling","ad hoc networks;constraint theory;distributed algorithms;integer programming;linear programming;power consumption;search problems;wireless LAN","distributed optimization algorithm;linear integer programming model;power control;variable neighborhood search;wireless ad hoc networks","","3","","14","","","26-30 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper mainly presents three experiments aimed to study the perceived length evoked by vibrotactile stimuli. In the pair-wise comparison experiments, standard (fixed) and comparison lines were respectively presented on the back of subjects. The standard line is the linearly arranged tactors with constant vibration parameters, while the vibration parameters of the comparison ones are variable. The results showed that the vibration parameters contributed differently to the length estimation performance. Vibration intensity, spatial distribution, rhythm have little effect on tactile length perception. While the number of stimulators and vibratory duration both having significant effect on the length estimation performance. There is a tendency to overestimate the vibration lines which contains more tactors or has longer stimulus duration.","","978-1-4673-5557-5","","10.1109/ICMA.2013.6617904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617904","Vibrotactile stimuli;length evaluation;passive touch","Distribution functions;Educational institutions;Estimation;Graphical models;Haptic interfaces;Standards;Vibrations","haptic interfaces;touch (physiological);vibrations","burst duration;comparison lines;dynamic vibrotactile stimuli;length estimation;linearly arranged tactors;spatial distribution;standard lines;stimulators;tactile stimuli;tactual length perception;vibration intensity;vibration parameters;vibratory duration;vibratory rhythm","","0","","24","","","4-7 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
