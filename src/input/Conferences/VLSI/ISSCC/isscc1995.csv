The addition of a power amplifier, LNA and filters are all that is required to implement a GSM terminal's radio section. This chip includes two fixed-frequency synthesizers (for transmit and receive IF frequencies), a programmable frequency agile UHF synthesizer (for channel selection in both receive and transmit modes), RF mixer, single IF down conversion with quadrature demodulation and variable gain for the receive path, and a direct-up modulator with offset oscillator to avoid spurious signals and oscillator pulling. The circuit also contains control circuitry for separate receive, transmit, and UHF synthesizer modes to minimise power consumption. The IC is implemented in a l2 GHz bipolar technology with a 1.5 /spl mu/m minimum feature.","0193-6530","0-7803-2495-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535470","","Filters;Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;GSM;Oscillators;Power amplifiers;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Transceivers","cellular radio","1.5 micron;12 GHz;2.7 to 4.5 V;915 MHz;IF down conversion;RF integrated circuit;RF mixer;UHF IC;bipolar technology;channel selection;fixed-frequency synthesizers;programmable frequency agile UHF synthesizer;quadrature demodulation;single-chip GSM transceiver","","30","5","2","","","15-17 Feb. 1995","15 Feb 1995-17 Feb 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The prototype IC contains 58,000 transistors in a core area of12 mm/sup 2/ in 1.0 /spl mu/m CMOS and dissipates 1.4 W at 100 MHz. Instead of table lookup, an angle-rotation algorithm implemented as a multiplierless feedforward datapath is used that allows easy pipelining and limits the accumulation of roundoff errors. The modular architecture permits outputs of arbitrary precision by cascading enough angle rotation stages in the datapath. The IC has a 36 b frequency control word giving a tuning resolution of 0.0015 Hz at 100 MHz. To achieve the 100 MHz clock rate in 1.0 /spl mu/m CMOS, the phase accumulator is partitioned into 22 b and 14 b carry-select adder sections.

This delay increases quadratically with the number of series switches, and is a problem especially when the programmable switches are implemented using MOS transistors, since these have an appreciable resistance and capacitance. The delay can be reduced, at the cost of routability, by limiting the number of series switches per interconnection, or at the cost of area by inserting repeaters. Conventional bidirectional repeaters consist of sets of unidirectional tristate buffers and memory cells. Their benefit is limited due to high area and delay penalty. Area and delay penalty can be alleviated by using a regenerative feedback that senses the beginning of a transition and subsequently enforces it. This requires one buffer and no memory cells. This article shows a network with such repeaters for direction-independent buffering.","0193-6530","0-7803-2495-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535455","","Clocks;Delay;Driver circuits;Feedback;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;MOSFETs;Repeaters;Switches;Threshold voltage","circuit feedback","FPGA performance;MOS transistors;area penalty;delay;direction-independent buffering;programmable interconnections;regenerative feedback repeaters","","3","","5","","","15-17 Feb. 1995","15 Feb 1995-17 Feb 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, these characteristics are approximated by expensive hybrids that are not programmable for various applications. This paper introduces a method for integrating such filters using current-mode transimpedance-based structures. A single-chip solution demonstrated here matches the requirements with less than /spl plusmn/0.25 dB gain ripple, /spl plusmn/20 ns group delay variation in the passband, and more than 40 dB attenuation in the stop band. The cut-off frequency, nominally set at 5.5 MHz, is continuously programmable over a decade. The IC can drive 2 Vpp signals into 75 /spl Omega/ load drawing 35 mA quiescent current.

At the input to the converter is a master/slave (M/S) track-and-hold amplifier (T/H), used to give the serial converter a full clock period to settle. The converter consists of five serially-connected folding amplifiers (called magnitude amplifiers, or magamps) and one 3 b flash. Each magamp accepts a differential analog input, resolves one bit of data using an internal comparator, and produces a folded differential analog output signal for the next stage. The converter is fabricated in a 1 /spl mu/m 8 GHz BiCMOS process. This prototype uses only 780 bipolar transistors and dissipates 350 mW from a single 5 V supply.

To understand circuit delay and power dissipation dependence on power supply voltage (V/sub DD/) and threshold voltage of MOSFETs (V/sub TH/), a typical logic circuit is investigated. Fanout is chosen to be 5 which corresponds to the statistical average of gate load in ASICs. A simulated delay dependence on V/sub DD/ and V/sub TH/ is presented. The same V/sub TH/ is chosen for nMOS and pMOS. It is shown that if V/sub TH/ is reduced to 0.3V, V/sub DD/ can be decreased down to 2V while maintaining the speed at V/sub TH/=0.7V and V/sub DD/=3V which is the typical operation condition for high-speed LSIs.

With this architecture, both fast lock time and low jitter are achieved by the system transfer function being changed; it is unnecessary to vary the values of system parameters in an attempt to reduce lock time. The HSPLL uses a reconfigurable delay line (RDL) that, depending upon the state of its switch circuit (SC), can operate either as a voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) or a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). When the RDL is operating as a VCDL (i.e. when the total circuit is a VCDL-PLL, a first-order system), lock time is fast and jitter is low, but it is difficult to generate a frequency-multiplied signal. This makes the VCDL-PLL configuration appropriate for the unlocked state. Then, at the instant that the HSPLL changes from the unlocked state to the locked, the condition of the SC is changed to create a VCO-PLL, a second-order system in which it is easy to generate a frequency-multiplied signal but difficult to achieve fast lock time (i.e. a situation well-suited to a locked state). This HSPLL architecture allows use of the respective advantages of both VCDL- and VCO-PLLs without having to suffer from their various disadvantages. The HSPLL is implemented in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS and two-layer metal technology. 2010 transistors are integrated into a 480/spl times/450 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ die area.

In each case, a core, first order clock recovery circuit is realized by two gated ring oscillators, indirectly frequency-tuned by a phase-locked loop using a third replica oscillator and a local reference signal. Instantaneous phase locking is guaranteed by restarting the gated oscillators every time input data transitions occur. This method has been demonstrated to be precise enough to handle input data patterns containing hundreds of bits between transitions without errors. In addition, the circuit is small and dissipates low power. However, the recovered clock signal thus obtained inherits all jitter present in the input data signal. This shortcoming has been overcome in the present designs by two different methods. The results are the total elimination of jitter propagation and the generation of clean data and clock output signals. The first chip operates at 150 Mb/s. Since the data is demultiplexed into 8 channels, the local reference signal runs eight times slower than the transmission rate. This allows ample time for jitter-rejection processing. The second chip operates at 30 Mb/s without a demultiplexer. The jitter rejection is accomplished with an elastic store based on five 1 b registers.","0193-6530","0-7803-2495-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535269","","Circuits;Clocks;Frequency;Jitter;Local oscillators;Passive optical networks;Phase locked loops;Registers;Ring oscillators;Signal generators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;jitter;optical communication equipment;optical fibre networks;synchronisation;timing circuits","0.9 micron;150 Mbit/s;30 Mbit/s;CMOS chips;CMOS data recovery circuits;CMOS nonoversampled clock circuits;PON systems;burst-mode clock;elastic store;gated ring oscillators;instantaneous locking;jitter rejection;jitter-rejection processing;passive optical network;phase-locked loop","","12","","2","","","15-17 Feb. 1995","15 Feb 1995-17 Feb 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is illustrated by plots of total area and stand-by current versus DC open-loop gain of two identical Miller op amps, one bulk and one SOI.","0193-6530","0-7803-2495-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535519","","Analog circuits;Analog-digital conversion;Costs;Degradation;Geometry;Hot carriers;Random access memory;Silicon;Temperature;Threshold voltage","field effect analogue integrated circuits;field effect logic circuits;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;silicon-on-insulator","DC open-loop gain;Miller opamps;SOI MOSFETs;high-speed logic;low-power analog design;low-voltage logic circuits;mixed analog-digital circuits","","9","1","9","","","15-17 Feb. 1995","15 Feb 1995-17 Feb 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MuMIC multi-chip module (MCM) results in low cost, small size, and many functions for microwave applications. This technology is used for 1.9 GHz digital European cordless telecommunication (DECT) power amplifier. The GaAs MMIC die of the the MuMlC can be less than 1/10 compared to the conventional one by integrating the impedance matching circuits and filters in the layered structure reducing manufacturing cost. The outline of the MuMIC also is smaller than that of the conventional MMIC package. High power-added efficiency of the microwave power amplifier is obtained by taking advantage of the low resistance inner layer line ofthe MuMIC and the low on-resistance FETs.","0193-6530","0-7803-2495-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535517","","Ceramics;Cost function;Gallium arsenide;Integrated circuit technology;MMICs;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave technology;Nonhomogeneous media;Power amplifiers;Temperature","UHF power amplifiers;cordless telephone systems;hybrid integrated circuits;impedance matching;integrated circuit technology;microwave integrated circuits;microwave power amplifiers;personal communication networks","1.9 GHz;MuMIC;digital European cordless telecommunication;impedance matching circuits;inner layer line;low cofired temperature ceramics;manufacturing cost;microwave power amplifier;multilayer microwave integrated circuit technology;personal communication systems;power-added efficiency","","0","","3","","","15-17 Feb. 1995","15 Feb 1995-17 Feb 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
