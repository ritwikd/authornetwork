Meanwhile, AC-DC converters for piezoelectric harvesters have been designed to enable efficient power extraction, or efficient rectification of low-voltage outputs, and have been tested with commercial meso-scale piezoelectric beams.

In order to capture binding dynamics of the fluorescent probe, as well as a wide range of possible tumor sizes and depths, the desired current resolution is 5pA. In applications with such low bandwidths and high sensitivity, a capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) can be used to provide high SNR through noise averaging (Ou and Chin, 203). The input current is integrated onto a capacitor C<sub>int</sub> for a period of time T<sub>int</sub>. The output of the CTIA is usually sampled and held at the end of T<sub>int</sub>, before being digitized as a DC signal. The readout noise power introduced at the sampling instant, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>read</sub>, limits the maximum achievable SNR of this architecture.

As rapid progress is made on com pact, high-frequency NIR LEDs, much research is being devoted to improve ments in the size, sensitivity and resolution of TOF image sensors. Analog pixel approaches provide compact pixel implementations but accuracy is limited by noise sources and nonlinearities of the analog electronics [2].

However, most of the underlying architectures in use today were conceived decades ago, and are nowadays regarded as fundamental in their nature. Were these architectures viewed as fundamental, potentially long lasting breakthroughs when they were first demonstrated? In this session, we bring together four pioneers of data converter design to review the invention and progression of the basic data converter architectures. Oversampling analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion has become the dominant approach in high-resolution, moderate-bandwidth interfaces. In the first talk, Bruce Wooley will review the beginnings of oversampling converters and discuss the various architectural refinements that have emerged over time. Our second talk will focus on two equally important developments of the 1970s and 1980s: charge-based A/D conversion and digital self-calibration. Hae-Seung Lee will examine these inventions in retrospect and explain why these techniques remain equally valuable today. In the third talk of this session, Stephen Lewis will lead us back to the early days of high-speed pipelined conversion. While today's pipelines can easily sample at several hundred megahertz, the challenge back then was to cope with the bandwidth of video signals. Pipelining the digitization enabled the designer to extract very high speeds from CMOS transistors that were relatively slow and still getting ready for prime time. The session concludes with a presentation from Doug Mercer on high-speed digital-to-analog converters, which will review design philosophy changes that occurred in the 1990s. With the emergence of broadband data communication, new application requirements came into play, forcing many designers of high-speed DACs back to the drawing board.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746422","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Converters;Digital-analog conversion;Modulation;Pipeline processing;Redundancy","analogue-digital conversion;digital-analogue conversion","CMOS transistors;analog-to-digital conversion;broadband data communication;charge-based A/D conversion;data converter architecture;data converter design;digital self-calibration;digital-to-analog conversion;high-speed digital-to-analog converters;high-speed pipelined conversion;modern process technology","","0","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A major advantage offered by the dual-residue ADC architecture is that the only calibration required is a calibration of the offset voltages of the MDAC amplifiers; a simple algorithm has been implemented that reaches convergence very rapidly and tracks the offsets for temperature drift and aging. Furthermore, the relaxed open-loop gain and bandwidth requirements of the MDACs allowed for a low-power implementation.

The chip is manufactured in commodity 0.18μm CMOS and requires only a single convex lens at a fixed focal length in ambient light. As traditional image sensors only capture the intensity of the light at each location, they lose significant information about out-of-focus objects. Recovering the angular distribution of incident light permits recovery of the blurred, out-of-focus objects.

Compared to conventional contact pins, wireless interfaces have received tremendous interest for reasons of more convenience, higher reliability, and higher data rate. Two major types of near-field wireless communication techniques using capacitive coupling and inductive coupling channels have been investigated. Tens of Gb/s/ch is achieved using both methods with a communication distance of tens of microns in TCI (thru-chip-interface) applications. However, when the communication distance Centers the mm range in such applications as non-contact memory cards, the sizes of capacitors or inductors must be up scaled to detect enough electrical flux or magnetic flux, whose magnitude decay as 1/d<sup>n</sup> (n>;1). As a result, the self-resonance frequency f<sub>SR</sub> is reduced significantly, which becomes the dominant limiting factor for the achievable data rate, since the maximum data rate is usually chosen as 1/2 or 1/3 of f<sub>SR</sub> in order to avoid signal peaking. Although multi-channel solutions are viable to increase the total data rate, complex systems are required to address the skew issues in synchronization, and low area efficiency is resulted to reduce crosstalk interferences.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746411","","Bandwidth;Couplings;Inductors;Power transmission lines;Receivers;Transceivers;Transmission line measurements","circuit resonance;coupled circuits;coupled transmission lines;magnetic flux;memory cards;synchronisation","bit rate 12 Gbit/s;capacitive coupling channel;capacitor;communication distance;contact pin;coupled transmission lines;data rate interface;electrical flux;inductive coupling channel;inductor;magnetic flux;magnitude decay;near-field wireless communication;noncontact interface;noncontact memory card;processor speed;self-resonance frequency;synchronization;thru-chip-interface;wireless interface","","11","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is commonly performed by placing a probe card directly above a device under test (DUT) and establishing a mechanical contact between them by means of an array of probes. This is an invasive technique that may damage fragile low-k dielectric layers and deform pads or bumps. More importantly, it is very difficult to flip thinned wafers face up for probing if they were earlier positioned face down for back grinding. Additional difficulty in handling of thinned wafers arises if dies have to be flipped again for bumping. One solution to above problems is wireless probing. With a number of proposed techniques for establishing high-speed inductive-coupling data links and measuring DC analog signal wirelessly, the largest remaining obstacle to non-contact wafer-level testing is supplying power to the DUT. This is because wireless power transfer solutions reported earlier do not provide an output power that is sufficient for testing modern high performance devices.This paper presents an inductive power transfer system that is capable of delivering up to 6W of DC power to the on-chip load. The system is partitioned into 8 power transfer channels, each containing two cir cuits: a power transmitter implemented in the probe card, and an on-chip power receiver. This paper focuses on the design of the power receiver, as the receiver performance limits the output power of the whole system.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746297","","Coils;Conferences;Inductors;Probes;Receivers;Rectifiers;Testing","circuit testing","DC analog signal;device under test;fabrication process;flip thinned wafers;high-speed inductive-coupling data links;inductive power transfer;invasive technique;low-k dielectric layers;manufacturing errors;mechanical contact;noncontact wafer-level testing;nonfunctional devices;probe card;wireless power transfer;wireless probing","","8","3","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most critical of these constraints is that the pixel must consume very low power, as an array will inflate the total power by n<sup>2</sup>, where n<sup>2</sup> is the total number of pixels in a square (n x n) array. Pixel circuit area is the 2<sup>nd</sup> major constraint, as the single pixel area will be also inflated by n<sup>2</sup>.

By obviating the need for a large loop filter capacitor and a high-performance charge pump, DPLLs offer area savings and easier scalability to newer processes. The ability to reconfigure the digital loop filter dynamically offers flexibility in setting the loop response and helps to optimize the locking behavior of the DPLL. However, conflicting bandwidth requirements to simultaneously suppress TDC quantization error and oscillator phase noise mandate either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator to minimize jitter. Further, much like in an analog PLL, the ring oscillator is susceptible to supply noise, which especially limits the jitter performance of a DPLL integrated into a large digital system. A low-dropout regulator is commonly used to shield the DCO from supply noise at the expense of additional area, power, and voltage headroom. Alternatively, an open-loop supply-noise cancellation scheme can operate at a lower supply voltage, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to process variations. Analog foreground calibration compensates for process variation but is susceptible to voltage, temperature, and frequency variations. In this paper, we present a deterministic test-signal-based back ground calibration scheme that leverages the highly digital nature of the DPLL to adaptively cancel the supply noise in the DCO.

The plastic waveguide is simply a long solid piece of plastic that provides a very simple, versatile, flexible, and low-cost transmission medium that has the main advantages of optical fiber in isolation and bandwidth, without the need for costly EO and OE. The dielectric waveguide does not need to be connected electrically like the wire or aligned to micron-level accuracy like optical fibers. It can be bent and twisted without significant impact on the signal. Compared to the wireless link discussed earlier, it offers additional signal isolation and confinement. Thus, it can be extended over much longer distances due to the low attenuation in the waveguide (as opposed to free space) and multiple independent lines can be run in parallel to increase the bandwidth. In our proposed plastic waveguide link, the TXs and RXs are fully integrated in CMOS, and the waveguide couplers can be fabricated in a conventional resin package without additional cost. In our existing setting there are a transmitter and a receiver operating at different carrier frequencies on each side of the waveguide, making it possible to realize a full-duplex solution. Because of the smaller fractional bandwidth for the millimeter-wave transmission, no equalization circuit is required.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746259","","Bandwidth;Baseband;Optical interconnections;Optical waveguides;Plastics;Power demand;Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits;millimetre wave couplers;optical fibre couplers;optical interconnections;optical receivers;optical transmitters;plastics","CMOS;carrier frequency;dielectric waveguide;full-duplex plastic waveguide interconnect;low-cost transmission medium;millimeter-wave signal transmission;millimeter-wave transmission;optical fiber;plastic waveguide link;receiver;resin package;signal confinement;signal isolation;transmitter;waveguide attenuation;waveguide coupler","","2","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An injection-locked ring PLL with self-aligned injection window","Che-Fu Liang; Keng-Jan Hsiao","MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2011 IEEE International","20110407","2011","","","90","92","In modern analog front-ends, there is an increasing demand on high performance analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which require high sampling frequency and low-jitter sampling clock. This makes low-jitter phase-locked loops (PLLs) with jitter on the order of few picoseconds desirable. Unfortunately, due to stringent limit on die area, sometimes a PLL with a ring oscillator is the only choice. To get better phase noise, a wider loop bandwidth is needed to suppress the noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). However, due to the discrete-time nature of the operations, the loop bandwidth is limited to one-tenth of the crystal oscillator (XTAL) frequency. One way to solve this problem is to use the injection-locking technique. This method exploits the clean reference clock but has several production problems. One is the frequency offset between injection signal and VCO, and this can be solved by using the injection-locked PLL architecture. However, extra loops are still needed to adjust the injection window due to on-chip variations. In this work, an injection-locked ring PLL (ILRPLL) architecture is proposed to solve this problem. Using the concept of sub-sampling PLL, the injection window is aligned automatically without feedback adjustment. A 432 MHz ILRPLL is realized in ATV/DTV system to justi fy this technique.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746232","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Current measurement;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","analogue-digital conversion;clocks;crystal oscillators;jitter;phase locked loops;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","ATV-DTV system;analog front-ends;analog-to-digital converters;clean reference clock;crystal oscillator frequency;frequency 432 MHz;frequency offset;injection-locked ring PLL architecture;injection-locking technique;loop bandwidth;low-jitter phase-locked loops;low-jitter sampling clock;noise suppression;on-chip variations;phase noise;ring oscillator;sampling frequency;self-aligned injection window;voltage-controlled oscillator","","14","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SoC simplifies integration of the sensor into the final product by providing camera functions such as: automatic exposure control, automatic white balance, flicker detection and avoidance, etc. This reduces cost and saves power since no companion chip is required, and the internal image-processing data rate of the SoC is higher than the output data rate [1], which keeps the inter chip communication data rate as low as possible. The small optical format enables a low camera module height. However, the choice of the small optical format also restricts the pixel pitch to 1.75μm, which influences both image quality and die size. The low light image quality, in this sensor, is improved by incorporating a 1.75μm pixel architecture, and the size of the sensor core is greatly reduced by removing the dark pixel reference rows and columns, using a single side dual bank of double-pitch sampling capacitors, a class-AB pro grammable-gain amplifier (PGA), followed by an inter-stage shared pipeline ADC.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746376","","Arrays;Cameras;Capacitors;Dark current;Noise;Pixel;System-on-a-chip","CMOS image sensors;amplifiers;analogue-digital conversion;cameras;capacitors;mobile handsets;system-on-chip","VGA system-on-chip CMOS image sensor;automatic exposure control;automatic white balance;camera mobile phone market;class-AB programmable-gain amplifier;distance 1.75 mum;double-pitch sampling capacitors;flicker avoidance;flicker detection;image quality;image-processing data rate;interchip communication data rate;interstage shared pipeline ADC;optical format;shared reset pixel control;single side dual bank;transfer-gate pixel control","","4","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, interferers can be rejected in the spatial domain for increased link robustness. These arrays can be implemented by phase shifting and summing the signals from antenna elements with uniform spacing. For accurate interference rejection, a phase shifter with uniform phase steps and constant amplitude is desired. Several types of continuous-time phase shifters have been published, e.g. using injection locking, phase selection and vector modulation.

The microprocessor used in personal computers is redesigned and optimized, delivering over 2-4× performance in the smartphone power envelope. High performance and variability resistant device technologies are presented for low power and multimedia products operating at very low V<sub>DD</sub>. The forum also has three presentations to discuss the design challenges for logic and memory in scaled technologies with increased parameter variations. For the digital design, pitfalls in deep-low-voltage circuits are summarized with emphasis on V<sub>DDmin</sub> issues with experimental results. SRAM design trade-offs with respect to area, read/write stability, and access time are discussed for different applications. Embedded non-volatile memory with zero power is also presented. Design tradeoffs involved in building blocks for low-power signal path along with on-die voltage regulators are discussed. Key analog circuits such as low-voltage voltage generator, VCO, PLL, ADC and DAC are examined for voltage scaling. Conventional bangap reference is no longer feasibile down to 0.5V regime. Different low-voltage voltage generator circuits and their pros and cons will be discussed.

A solution is the use of active electrodes, i.e. electrodes in which an amplifier with high input impedance, low noise and good electrode offset rejection is co-integrated. Previous active electrodes employed voltage buffers to facilitate the inter-channel gain matching necessary to achieve high CMRR.

However, the oscillation frequency dependence on the biasing current makes it susceptible to phase noise, close-in in particular. At mm-Waves, this is exacerbated by core devices of small dimensions to such an extent that 1/f noise remains dominant up to more than ~10MHz, making it unsuitable for stringent applications.

In this inaugural Plenary Technology-Roundtable event, experts will discuss the opportunities to achieve the next order-of-magnitude reduction in energy consumption across various domains, including analog, digital, RF, and memory. The line between analog and digital continues to blur, as analog circuits are enhanced by applying digital corrections to compensate for increased analog component variability with process scaling. As well, digital will incorporate more analog to become more adaptive; for example, to optimize operating voltages at a fine-grain to match workloads and process variations. Memory circuits will need to use a system-level approach which requires bit-cell optimization, low-voltage operation with integrated regulators, 3D Through-Silicon Vias (TSV), and process optimization. RF transceivers will continue to trend toward highly-digital architectures. The role of process-technology innovation and CAD tools will also be discussed. Future process technology will deliver new transistor structures and higher-mobility channel materials for low-voltage digital circuits. TSVs will be important in reducing I/O power and the length of on-chip interconnects. For RF, integrated inductors and transformers with significantly lower resistance will be the challenge.

In order to meet this demand, the electronic industry has to address the limitations of power consumption and form factor in the present solutions. Let us define gigabit class as physical layer data rate to be greater than 1Gb/s; while portability as the battery capacity limited to 25W-hour lithium polymer battery at 3.75V (similar to the Apple iPad) or about 1000mA-hour at 3.75V for a typical cellular phone. These devices offer different classes of multi-media experience, however, are both very popular among consumers. The key question is: how to be energy efficient in data-rate/power consumption for the Gb/s+device? For practical wireless application, the range needs to be at least a size of a room. In this special evening session, we have assembled a group of industrial experts in gigabit wireless communication to speak about their respective technology; and their views on how these standards can achieve lowest power AND highest data rate simultaneously.

This paper presents a 570fs<sub>rms</sub> integrated-jitter 1.21GHz PLL with a hybrid loop. A ring VCO has a much inferior phase noise characteristic as compared to an LC VCO, but its area efficiency is attractive. To suppress the phase noise of a ring VCO, a wide-loop-bandwidth PLL with sufficiently low in-band noise is indispensable. An all-digital PLL (ADPLL) has insufficiently low in-band phase noise because of the quantization error of the time-to-digital converter (TDC) without employing additional techniques such as power-hungry time amplification. On the other hand, a conventional analog PLL has a superior in-band phase noise but needs a large loop-filter capacitor to maintain a wide tuning range due to a high control sensitivity of the ring VCO. The dual-tuning topology is useful for minimizing the size of the loop filter while maintaining low in-band phase noise. However, it also suffers from strong reference spurs, as it is the case in the conventional analog PLL having a wide loop band width. The proposed PLL employs a hybrid loop consisting of a type-ll ADPLL and a type-l analog PLL. The type-ll ADPLL enables the wide tuning range with out a large loop-filter capacitor. The loop-filter capacitor in the analog PLL is also minimized since it does not need to cover a wide tuning range. The analog PLL eliminates the residual quantization error of the TDC in the ADPLL and achieves a sufficiently low in-band phase noise. Overall, the proposed PLL suppresses the phase noise contribution from the ring digital/voltage-controlled oscillator (DVCO).","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746236","","Image edge detection;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","analogue integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;circuit tuning;digital phase locked loops;filters;jitter;network topology;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","ADC;all-digital PLL;circuit performance;clock jitter;dual-tuning topology;frequency 1.21 GHz;hybrid loop;integrated jitter;loop-filter capacitor;low in-band noise;phase noise suppression;quantization error;ring VCO;ring digital-voltage-controlled oscillator;time-to-digital converter;type-l analog PLL;type-ll ADPLL;wide tuning range;wide-loop-bandwidth PLL","","3","2","8","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the performance advantages of these caches flat-lined, they added multiple processor cores. This trend has dominated the industry for many years. Until now. A revolutionary shift is underway.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746448","","","","","","0","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

R&D dollars are increasing, once at 12% of revenue in 1998, now at 18% in 2010. As product design costs rise, the number of projects is declining, needing more synchronization of process and design development. Restrictive design rules (unidirectional poly, no jogs, dummy insertion, structured layout), adaptive architectures and expanded design for manufacturability are needed to address variability.

Instead of scaling the supply with the data rate, we seek to operate with two fixed voltages and eliminate the need for a high-efficiency DC-DC converter. To this end, this paper presents a serial link using a highly efficient current recycling-based implicit DC-DC conversion to generate 0.6V from a 1.2V supply. Highly digital clocking circuits capable of operating at 0.6V maximize power savings.

Range and velocity resolutions of the FMCW radar are determined by the band width and period of triangular modulation (Pourvoyeur et al., 2008). A short-range measurement requires wide (several GHz) bandwidth, while a long-range measurement with high-velocity resolution requires moderate (hundreds of MHz) bandwidth and long (several ms) period. Furthermore, since frequency error in the FMCW signal deteriorates range and velocity accuracy, a highly linear frequency chirp signal is required. However FMCW radars reported so far exhibit a period up to 1.5ms because a long period degrades the chirp linearity in a conventional analog PLL. In this work, an analog/digital mixed-mode 82GHz FMCW synthesizer with 1.5GHz bandwidth, a period from 1ms to 10ms and less than 180kHz<sub>rms</sub> frequency error is described.

As such they are expected to function flawlessly, interoperate cleanly, and consume little power, area, and system design mindshare. As part of the 'commoditizing' of transceivers, the pressure to achieve multiple standards compliance from individual designs has increased dramatically no longer are ASIC or system designers content with a single PHY for a single standard. The consequential impact on the design space means link designers must often 'right size' a swiss-army-knife design including power and area optimization; you don't want too many or too few 'blades'. Sometimes conflicting standards requirements can make customization and optimization a real challenge in this space. Jared Zerbe of Rambus will review some of the fundamental transceiver challenges and techniques used to address them, including a discussion of the impact of multi-standard compliance on the transceiver design effort and ultimate performance. Following this, Thomas Toifl of IBM will discuss the design challenges and solutions to data rates above 20Gb/s. Main challenges are achieving the required bandwidth with full ESD protection, the DFE loop timing, and overall design complexity. Marcus van lerssel of Snowbush IP will discuss implementation challenges and the benefits of a multi-standard PHY supporting Ethernet/PCIe/SATA/USB. Takeshi Horiefrom Fujitsu will present Ethernet standards and the technologies required to realize 10GB serial backplane transfer for 10GB Ethernet. When it comes to buidling standards compliant PHYs, IP providers face challenges that arise from the need to proliferate the design across many process geome tries/foundries and also from the large variability in customer's expertise in package design and signal integrity analysis. Dan Weinl- der of Synopsys will discuss how standards influence these challenges. The main focus of standards over the last few years has understandably been on addressing the bandwidth curve. The need to address the rising power struggle of SoCs is usually recognized, but limited to simple power targets.

Frequency dividers are key building blocks for LO generation in wireless transceivers and clock synchronization in front-ends for wire-line and optical communications. Dividers based on traditional static CML latches work over a wide band but power dissipation at mm-Waves is extremely large. To save power, recently reported mm-Wave PLLs propose tunable narrowband dividers, based on injection-locking techniques, together with digital calibration algorithms. On the other hand, for division factors higher than 2, the frequency locking range of injection-locked oscillators is very limited, mandating fine and frequent calibrations. This paper introduces clocked differential amplifiers, working as dynamic CML latches, to realize high speed and low power mm-Wave dividers. The solution is very compact, which is particularly desirable at mm-Waves to ease chip layout and shorten IC interconnections, minimizing signal losses. A frequency divider-by-4 has been realized in a 65nm bulk CMOS technology and prototypes prove an operating frequency programmable from 20 to 70GHz. The frequency range in each sub-band spans from 10% to 17%, corresponding to a 2.5x to 4x improvement compared to injection-locked dividers-by-4.

Similar to ADCs, existing architectures of TDCs can be divided into several categories: flash TDCs, pipeline TDCs, and SAR TDCs. The highest achievable time resolution of a TDC is mainly limited by the CMOS gate delay. In order to achieve sub-gate-delay resolution, the Vernier method is commonly used. However, the mismatch problem caused by process variation limits its effectiveness, and the same holds for the time amplification method. The gated-ring-oscillator (GRO) method is introduced to achieve sub-ps time resolution, but it still requires an equivalent CMOS gate delay as low as 6ps. Upcoming applications in 4,h-generation nuclear reactors, space, and high-energy physics such as the large Hadron collider (LHC), require the TDC to achieve a high time resolution in harsh environments with high tem perature and radiation, where the threshold voltage, transconductance, and delay of a transistor undergo dramatic changes. In these cases, the high accu racy and robustness of the TDC need to be inherent to the design rather than by employing a fast CMOS technology.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746406","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Converters;Delay;Multi-stage noise shaping;Noise;Quantization","CMOS integrated circuits;delta-sigma modulation;phase locked loops","ΔΣ time-to-digital converter;ADC;CMOS gate delay;CMOS technology;SAR TDC;digital PLL;flash TDC;gated-ring-oscillator;high time resolution;high-resolution TDC;jitter measurement;large Hadron collider;mismatch problem;pipeline TDC;process variation limits;subgate-delay resolution;threshold voltage;time amplification method;time-of-flight measurement units;transconductance","","4","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side.

Additionally, this active mixer rejects flicker noise and improves second-order intermodulation (IIP2) and image rejection (IR) performance.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746222","","Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Radio frequency;Receivers;Resistors;Switches;Transistors","flicker noise;intermodulation;mixers (circuits)","IF section;RF device mismatches;active mixer;bandwidth penalty;capacitor matching;flicker noise;harmonic rejection mixer;image rejection;resistor matching;second-order intermodulation","","19","4","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Higher swing also helps meet certain I/O standards in applications where losses introduced by high-density package constraints can be compensat ed to some extent. The source-series terminated (SST) driver is a versatile building block in a multi standard I/O TX thanks to its potential for low-power operation, its low area consumption, high CMOS-style circuit content, and flexible termination capability.

The conventional GPS solution often uses two SAW filters, before and after an external LNA, to meet the requirements of low noise and multi-radio coexistence. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to remove the external LNA and interstage SAW filter due to size and cost, which presents a great design challenge to achieve high out-of-band linearity with very low power consumption. To fulfill these stringent requirements, a more comprehensive approach is needed to tar get a radio architecture with a proper RX system budgeting and optimal circuit design. In addition, a GPS system can be desensitized by unexpected in-band blockers generated from other subsystems on the same platform, such as LCD display, PMU, CPU system clocks, etc. The GPS digital baseband processor must possess the capability to withstand in-band blockers without significant performance degradation.

"Spurious-noise-free buck regulator for direct powering of analog/RF loads using PWM control with random frequency hopping and random phase chopping","Chengwu Tao; Fayed, A.A.","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA, USA","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2011 IEEE International","20110407","2011","","","396","398","Buck regulators are widely employed in portable devices due to their high power-conversion efficiency. However, due to their spurious output noise, they are not directly used to power sensitive analog/RF modules, and subsequent linear low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are needed to generate secondary low-noise supply rails for these modules. This results in lower efficiency, and increased size and cost. Moreover, as switching frequencies increase to reduce passive components, LDOs become less effective in filtering the switching noise due to their poor power-supply rejection (PSR) beyond 1 MHz. Several techniques for reducing the spurious noise of buck regulators by manipulating their switching behavior have been studied. This includes using ΔΣ or Δ modulators in the control loop, which although reduce the spurs, result in large increases in the noise floor that mandates subsequent LDOs. Other techniques redistribute the power of each spur into multiple smaller ones using random frequency hopping, or periodic monotonic frequency stepping. However, the resulting spectrum continues to be spurious and the reduction reported in the largest spur is limited to 10 to 12 dB. This limited reduction, coupled with the fact that many extra spurs are generated, leaves the load circuitry vulnerable to performance degradation. This paper proposes a pulse-width modulation (PWM) control scheme for buck converters based on combining random frequency hopping with phase chopping. The technique results in full elimination of spurs, elimination of hopping transients, very low noise floor, and minimalist implementation with little overhead on area and power.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746368","","Artificial neural networks;Converters;Floors;Frequency shift keying;Noise;Regulators;Switches","PWM power convertors;circuit noise;power conversion;voltage regulators","ΔΣ modulators;PWM control;analog-RF loads;hopping transient elimination;linear low-dropout regulators;noise floor;periodic monotonic frequency stepping;power sensitive analog-RF modules;power-conversion efficiency;power-supply rejection;pulse-width modulation control scheme;random frequency hopping;random phase chopping;secondary low-noise supply rails;spurious-noise-free buck regulator;switching frequency;switching noise filtering","","8","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a conventional driver, either a series current source or a sense resistor acts as a CRE to regulate the LED current (l<sub>LED</sub>). In this paper, we seek to improve the efficiency by eliminating the series CRE. To this end, we employ a highly accurate current sensing scheme to directly regulate l<sub>LED</sub> and achieve more than 13% efficiency improvement. The LED driver is fabricated in a 0.5μm CMOS process and operates at switching frequencies up to 2MHz with an off-chip 2.2μH inductor and a 10μF capacitor. The converter can drive up to 1200mA at an LED forward voltage of about 3.6V. This paper shows the converter start-up, l<sub>L</sub>, and V<sub>SENSE</sub> in all the 3 modes of operation. For better illustration, l<sub>L</sub> is displayed with a 50mA offset on all the plots. Because a different sense-FET is selected in each switching cycle, V<sub>SENSE</sub> differs from cycle to cycle by the amount of mismatch between the sense-FET and the power-FET. However, V<sub>SENSE</sub> averaged over 32 switching cycles, obtained from the LED current estimator, yields an accurate measure of the LED current.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746300","","Accuracy;Converters;Current measurement;Driver circuits;IP networks;Light emitting diodes;Sensors","CMOS integrated circuits;driver circuits;light emitting diodes;power field effect transistors;switching convertors","CMOS process;LED current estimator;LED forward voltage;buck-boost LED driver;capacitance 10 muF;current 1.2 A;current regulation element;efficiency loss;error-averaged SenseFET-based current sensing;frequency 2 MHz;power FET;sense resistor;size 0.5 mum;voltage 3.6 V","","3","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extracting the bit rate from the incoming random data stream is the main challenge in implementing reference-less CDRs. A conventional rotational frequency detector has a limited acquisition range of about ±50% of the VCO frequency, consumes large power, and is susceptible to harmonic locking. Extending its range requires additional high-speed circuitry and a complex state machine. The DLL-based architecture requires passing high-speed data through a long string of power-hungry buffers, imposes stringent matching requirements, and works only with ring oscillators. Other approaches require detailed statistical or timing analysis. Further, all the above techniques are only suitable for full-rate CDRs. In this paper, we present a reference-less half-rate CDR that uses a sub-harmonic extraction method to achieve unlimited frequency acquisition range. This technique is capable of locking the CDR to within 40ppm of any sub-rate of the data (making it applicable for any sub-rate CDR architecture), while being immune to undesirable harmonic locking. This CDR also integrates a calibration loop to improve robustness to input duty cycle error.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746387","","Clocks;Delay;Frequency conversion;Frequency locked loops;Image edge detection;Phase locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators","clock and data recovery circuits;clocks;optical communication;statistical analysis;voltage-controlled oscillators","DLL-based architecture;VCO;activity-based rate adaptation;data recovery circuit;digital clock circuit;harmonic locking;input duty-cycle error tolerance;optical communication network;rotational frequency detector;statistical analysis;subharmonic extraction method;timing analysis","","6","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While such architecture provides ease of programmability once the signals are digitized, it puts a large burden on the ADC and anti-alias filter. Hence, ADCs typically use high-performance analog circuits for wide dynamic range, even though it is difficult to implement these circuits using low-voltage nanoscale CMOS processes. A promising ADC architecture for an MMMB receiver is the VCO-based ADC, since it offers 1<sup>st</sup>-order noise-shaping from its open-loop digital-intensive nature, thus allowing high sampling rate and high SNR. Furthermore, the VCO-based ADC provides an inherent anti-aliasing 1<sup>st</sup>-order Sinc filter due to the innate integrating ability of the VCO. Unfortunately, for multiband receivers that do not have an RF pre-filter, a Sinc filter alone does not provide enough out-of-band rejection and hence higher-order anti-aliasing filters are required. In order to solve this problem, we propose a 2<sup>nd</sup>-order anti-aliasing Sinc filter (Sinc<sup>2</sup> filter) that provides double the rejection ratio of a Sinc filter. Furthermore, the proposed technique is highly digital and can be embedded in a VCO, resulting in little overhead.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746271","","Low pass filters;Mixers;Radio frequency;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wideband","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;amplifiers;analogue-digital conversion;antialiasing;low-power electronics;nanotechnology;radio receivers;radiofrequency filters;voltage-controlled oscillators","1st-order noise-shaping;2nd-order antialiasing Sinc filter;ADC architecture;MMMB receivers;RF prefilter;VCO-based ADC;VGA;analog filter;antialias filter;digital-intensive receiver front-end;double the rejection ratio;embedded 2nd-order antialiasing sinc filter;high-performance analog circuits;higher-order antialiasing filters;innate integrating ability;low-voltage nanoscale CMOS processes;mixer;multimode multiband receivers;open-loop digital-intensive nature;out-of-band rejection;programmability;receiver chain;size 90 nm;variable-gain amplifier;wide-dynamic-range ADC","","6","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design targets become more and more challenging with every new technology generation which shows with increasing variability how to keep energy efficiency high in every mode of operation, i.e. sleep, standby, regular, and peak performance. General techniques being applied here are gating, adaptivity, and calibration. Finally, in the future really successful improvements of energy efficiency will bring the dilemma that the classical ""flexibility vs. energy conflict"" is replaced by a new ""energy vs. reliability conflict"" due to an increasing rate of transient faults. The objective of this Forum is to present a comprehensive overview of energy efficient optimization methodologies for the different kinds of processors (general purpose / application / embedded SoC, single / multi core processors) and to give exemplary examples.

Energy and area-efficient circuits, as well as eliminating off chip components, are critical to meeting these objectives. A conventional WSN node can be fully integrated in CMOS except for the battery, crystal reference, and antenna. Typically, a PLL and a crystal reference are used for RF synchronization and to position the wireless signal in a desired band for FCC compliance. Crystals, however, require custom packaging that currently prohibits scaling to mm<sup>3</sup> sizes. Moreover, an off-chip antenna increases the size of the node and raises the cost. In this paper, a fully integrated 60GHz frequency-locked loop (FLL) in 0.13μm CMOS is presented using an on-chip patch antenna as both the radiator and reference for frequency generation. The proposed technique efficiently integrates the antenna, eliminates the need for a crystal reference, is FCC compliant, and ensures the node transmits at the antenna's peak efficiency. The substrate beneath the antenna is shielded by an intermediate metal layer ground plane, freeing up space for active circuits and routing beneath the patch. By inte grating circuits in CMOS underneath the patch, and stacking the die on e.g. a thin-film battery, a fully integrated WSN node in mm<sup>3</sup> scale is feasible.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746320","","Antenna measurements;Frequency locked loops;Frequency measurement;Patch antennas;Transmission line measurements;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;field effect MIMIC;frequency locked loops;microstrip antennas;millimetre wave antennas;wireless sensor networks","CMOS process;FCC compliance;RF synchronization;antenna peak efficiency;antenna-referenced frequency-locked loop;crystal reference;field effect MIMIC;frequency 60 GHz;frequency generation;intermediate metal layer ground plane;millimetre wave antennas;off-chip antenna;on-chip patch antenna;size 0.13 mum;thin-film battery;wireless sensor networks","","0","","3","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another evolving direction is the removal of external components, aiming at lower-cost mobile devices and a higher integration level of functions, including a large number of bands and multistandard operation to guarantee global coverage.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746454","","","","","","0","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reducing the number of physical access ports in a memory cell can thus lead to significant area and power savings as well as latency improvement. Double-pumped register files operate access ports twice in a single clock period to reduce area by halving the number of physical ports in the memory cell-a technique often confined to low-frequency applications. Replication of a memory cell in separate arrays halves the number of physical read ports in each copy. In this work, double-pumped write ports and replicated read ports are applied to a 4R2W register file in a high performance microprocessor product. This paper describes detailed implementation and measured hardware characteristics of this array and demonstrates a fast error correction scheme. The techniques used balance high efficiency and low latency and thus differ from previous work, in which double pumped ports perform a write followed by a read in a very large register file or where write ports are double-pumped without cell-level read port reduction.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746308","","Arrays;Capacitance;Clocks;Driver circuits;Multiplexing;Registers;Timing","clocks;low-power electronics;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;multiport networks;random-access storage","4R2W register file;bitline wiring;double-pumped register file;double-pumped write operation;double-pumped write port;error correction;frequency 2.3 GHz;high performance microprocessor product;memory cell size;multiported register file;physical access port;physical read port;power saving;replicated read port;single clock period;wire-speed POWER processor;wordline","","4","","3","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In PON, a single CDR performs the task of clock and data recovery for several burst sequences, each originating from a different source. As a result, the BMCDR is required to lock to an incom ing data stream within tens of Uls (for example 40ns in GPON). Previous works use either injection locking [3, 4] or gated VCO [5, 6] to achieve this fast lock ing. In both cases, the control voltage of the CDR's VCO is generated by a refer ence PLL with a matching VCO to guarantee accurate frequency locking. However, any component mismatch between the two VCO's results in a frequen cy offset between the reference PLL frequency and the CDR's VCO frequency, and hence in a reduction of the CDR's tolerance for consecutive identical digits (CID). For example, [7] reports a frequency offset of over 20MHz (2000ppm) for 10Gb/s operation. We present a BMCDR that is based on phase interpolation (PI), eliminating the possibility of local frequency offset between the reference and recovered clock. We demonstrate 1 to 6Gb/s operation in 65nm CMOS with a locking time of less than 1UI.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746261","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Delay;Logic gates;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;clock and data recovery circuits;frequency locked loops;interpolation;passive optical networks;phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","PLL frequency;bit rate 1 Gbit/s to 6 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;clock-forwarding link;consecutive identical digit;frequency locking;gated VCO;injection locking;passive optical network;phase-lnterpolator-based burst-mode clock and data recovery circuit;size 65 nm","","9","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A current-steering DAC comprises current cells of various sizes. Each of them contains a current source and a current switch. The DAC static linearity, specified as differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), is mainly determined by the mutual matching and the output resistance of the current sources. The DAC also exhibits dynamic distortion. It is manifested as spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) degradation. The SFDR decreases rapidly with increasing input frequency. There are two major sources of dynamic distortion, code-dependent switching transients (CDST) and code-dependent output-loading variation (CDLV). Switching transients are temporal disturbances in DAC out put when the current switches in current cells make transitions. The output load ing of a DAC varies when the output impedances of current cells change due to the transposition of their current switches. This DAC applies a digital random return-to-zero (DRRZ) technique to mitigate the CDST effect. Compact current cells are designed to minimize the CDLV effect. The current mismatches of the current cells are corrected by background calibration.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746278","","CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Current measurement;Frequency measurement;MOSFETs;Semiconductor device measurement;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;constant current sources;digital-analogue conversion;transient analysis","CDST effect mitigation;CMOS process;SFDR;code-dependent output-loading variation;code-dependent switching transients;current source;current switch;current-steering DAC;differential nonlinearity;digital random return-to-zero technique;high-frequency signal generation;integral nonlinearity;size 90 nm;spurious-free dynamic range degradation;word length 12 bit","","9","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By injecting the reference clock edge into the VCO at each reference cycle, an MDLL removes the accumulated jitter of the VCO. The principal challenge in MDLL design is to align the injected reference edge with the loop feedback signal. Timing mismatch between the reference edge and the VCO feedback edge, or offsets in the charge pump, would introduce a phase error in the injected edge. The error manifests as a period jitter or reference spur in the frequency domain. This effect limits the minimum jitter attained by the MDLL. In previously published techniques, a select logic block generates an SEL pulse to briefly open an aperture for reference injection. A necessary attribute of the SEL pulse is that it is sufficiently sharp and well-positioned to select the next reference edge. However, at high frequencies, the position of the SEL pulse impacts the delay of the MUX and hence introduces pattern jitter and spurs. This paper minimizes the spur by introducing a calibrated phase delay to properly position the SEL pulse with respect to the reference edge, and by minimizing the inherent error of the charge pump.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746400","","Apertures;Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Jitter;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","charge pump circuits;circuit feedback;circuit noise;circuit tuning;delay lock loops;jitter;phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","MDLL design;SEL pulse;VCO feedback edge;VCO-based PLL;aperture position tuning;calibrated phase delay;charge pump;frequency 4.6 GHz;frequency domain;jitter accumulation;logic block;loop feedback signal;multiplying delay-locked loop;period jitter;phase error;reference clock edge;reference cycle;reference spur;timing mismatch","","5","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digital equalization can be implemented as an FFE or DFE. An adaptive FFE is straight forward to implement, as it relies on magnitudes only (not phases) of the blind samples, however, it enhances the quantization noise of the ADC. A DFE has better noise immunity, but challenges remain in designing an adap tive DFE for receivers with blind clocks. A typical adaptive engine for a DFE com pares the equalized center samples against a desired level to calculate error in each sample. The power of this error is then minimized to guide equalization. In a blind receiver, however, the center samples are not known; the blind samples may deviate from the eye's center and move closer to the zero crossings. As a result, one cannot use a single desired level independent of the blind sampling phase; the desired level must change according to the sampling phase. In this paper, we use a desired waveform, instead of a desired level, to perform the adaptation. Our measurement results confirm that this approach adapts the coefficients within 80μs and opens an otherwise closed eye for a channel atten uation of 13.3dB at 2.5GHz.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746386","","Adaptive equalizers;CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Engines;Receivers;Signal generators","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;clock and data recovery circuits;decision feedback equalisers","ADC-based receivers;CDR;CMOS;DFE;analogue-digital converters;bit rate 5 Gbit/s;blind clocks;blind receiver;clock and data recovery circuits;decision feedback equalisers;digital equalization;frequency 2.5 GHz;quantization noise;size 65 nm;time 80 mus","","0","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Figure 11.4.1 shows the measured memory cell error in the data retention and program disturb of 4X, 3X and 2Xnm NAND flash memories. As the memory size decreases, both data retention and program disturb errors increase due to the interference, random telegraph noise and reduced electrons. In the scaled NAND, the electric field in the channel increases and the program disturb due to GIDL-induced hot electron injection becomes more significant (Fig. 11.4.1(c)). In conventional SSDs, 20 to 40 b correction per 1 KB codeword error-correcting code (ECC) is used to correct errors. As stronger codes, such as LDPC, are developed, the capability of ECC is close to the Shannon limit of a few percent error correction. Thus, the additional high-reliability scheme is required. As the feature size decreases, the power consumption increases due to the increased bit-line capacitance of NAND. As the space between bitlines decreases, the inter bitline capacitance increases. To overcome reliability and power problems in SSDs, this paper describes two technologies. Asymmetric coding improves memory-cell reliability by 95% without access-time penalty. Stripe pattern elimination algorithm eliminates the worst program data pattern and decreases the power during the program by 43% without circuit area or access time overhead.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746283","","Capacitance;Computer architecture;Encoding;Flash memory;Measurement uncertainty;Microprocessors;Reliability","NAND circuits;error correction codes;error statistics;flash memories;integrated circuit reliability;low-power electronics","BER;ECC;GIDL-induced hot electron injection;NAND flash memory;Shannon limit;bit-line capacitance;data retention;electric field;error-correcting code;high-reliability scheme;low-power intelligent solid-state drive;memory cell error;memory-cell reliability;power consumption;random telegraph noise;stripe pattern elimination algorithm;word length 20 bit to 40 bit","","10","","8","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A 660pW multi-stage temperature-compensated timer for ultra-low-power wireless sensor node synchronization","Yoonmyung Lee; Giridhar, B.; Zhiyoong Foo; Sylvester, D.; Blaauw, D.","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2011 IEEE International","20110407","2011","","","46","48","Recent work in ultra-low-power sensor platforms has enabled a number of new applications in medical, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Due to their limited energy storage volume, these sensors operate with long idle times and ultra-low standby power ranging from 10s of nW down to 100s of pW. Since radio transmission is relatively expensive, even at the lowest reported power of 0.2mW, wireless communication between sensor nodes must be performed infrequently. Accurate measurement of the time interval between communication events (i.e. the synchronization cycle) is of great importance. Inaccuracy in the synchronization cycle time results in a longer period of uncertainty where sensor nodes are required to enable their radios to establish communication (Fig. 2.7.1), quickly making radios dominate the energy budget. Quartz crystal oscillators and CMOS harmonic oscillators exhibit very small sensitivity to supply voltage and temperature but cannot be used in the target application space since they operate at very high frequencies and exhibit power consumption that is several orders of magnitude larger (>;300nW) than the needed idle power. A gate-leakage-based timer was proposed that leveraged small gate leakage currents to achieve power consumption within the required budget (<; 1nW). However, this timer incurs high RMS jitter (1400ppm) and temperature sensitivity (0.16%/<sup>o</sup>C). A 150pW program-and-hold timer was proposed to reduce temperature sensitivity but its drifting clock frequency limits its use for synchronization. The quality of a timer is not captured well by RMS jitter since it ignores the averaging of jitter over multiple timer clock periods in a single synchronization cycle. Instead, we propose the uncertainty in a single synchronization cycle of length T as new metric and use this synchronization uncertainty (SU) to evaluate different timer approaches. The timer period is a random variable X(n), with mean and sigma, μ and σ. Given a synchronization cycle time T, consisting of N timer periods, we define SU as the standard deviation of T as given by √(T/μ) × σ, assuming X(n) is Gaussian. Note that a smaller clock period increases N and results in more averaging and a lower SU with fixed jitter (σ/μ).","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746213","","Jitter;Leakage current;Logic gates;Synchronization;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Uncertainty","detector circuits;logic circuits;low-power electronics;synchronisation;wireless sensor networks","energy storage volume;multistage temperature compensated timer;power 150 pW;power 660 pW;program-and-hold timer;radio transmission;synchronization cycle;time interval;ultralow power wireless sensor node synchronization","","10","1","7","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, current sensing techniques using the existing inductor series DC resistance (DCR) are gaining attention due to their reduced complexity and minimized loss. These techniques increase the need for inductor build-in self test (BIST) ability to measure DCR. Inductor BIST is also critical for high-reliability applications such as automotive and aerospace systems where component variation and drift need to be closely monitored. An analog inductor characterization and current sensing technique utilizing Gm-C filtering is proposed in [2], where the gain errors and sensing offset are cancelled in analog domain.

The resulting baseband noise can also be a significant error source, and thus reducing the total error down to sub μV levels at DC and low frequencies has been targeted. Chopping is more suitable to lower the base band noise PSD, as it is primarily determined by the broad-band thermal noise floor and not aliased by the high frequency noise. Reducing the thermal noise floor requires higher value of input transconductance. Consequently, more capacitance or higher output transconductance is required to stabilize the over all feedback loop with regular Miller compensation. A 6.5nV/VHz conditionally stable chopper operational amplifier has been reported, using multi-pole feedforward compensation techniques. Unconditionally stable chopper operational amplifiers presented so far exhibit more than 10nVMfz noise PSD.

Growing device variability and power limitations are driving innovative solutions to maintain robustness and area efficiency in such aggressively scaled memories.

The relatively large cell size and conflicting requirements for read and write at low operating voltages make aggressive scaling of 6T SRAMs challenging in sub 22nm. Recently, 1T1C embedded DRAMs (eDRAMs) have replaced SRAMs in several server applications reducing the cache area and improving performance. Difficulties in scaling the trench capacitor and the additional process steps involved in manufacturing the thick oxide access devices are currently limiting the wide spread adoption of 1T1C technology. Gain cells have features such as decoupled read and write paths, a nondestructive read, and a 2X higher bit-cell density than a 6T SRAM, making them a strong contender for future embedded memories. However, the boosted supplies needed for robust operation necessitates thick oxide devices to prevent gate reliability issues in gain cells. Although this would lead to a larger bit-cell size and decreased macro perform ance, these limitations have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we pres ent the following circuit techniques for realizing a truly logic compatible (i.e. thin oxide only implementation) gain cell eDRAM with no boosted supplies; (i) a 2T1C gain cell featuring a beneficial couple-up read and a preferential couple down write, (ii) a single-ended 7T SRAM to repair weak gain cells, and (iii) a storage voltage monitor capable of tracking PVT and cell retention time for adap tive refresh control.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746418","","Arrays;Maintenance engineering;Random access memory;Redundancy;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Voltage measurement","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;embedded systems;logic circuits","6T SRAM;embedded DRAM macro;embedded memory;frequency 700 MHz;generic logic process","","5","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This embedded DRAM can replace on-chip SRAM page buffers and other caches with minimum cost to enhance NAND flash memory performance. This opens up a new technical direction and wide applications for NAND flash memories. Figure 28.9.2(a) shows the concept of the embedded DRAM. An obstacle to embed DRAM in a NAND flash memory chip is a lack of cell charge, because the cell capacitance Cs using a planar MOS capacitor is limited to 3fF at the highest, whereas that of an ordinary embedded DRAM is around 20fF by using extra trenched or stacked capacitor process steps. However, even with a small 3fF cell, a cell node bias up to 4V, which is 4 times as high as the ordinary DRAM bias by taking advantage of the high-voltage NAND flash process, and a low parasitic capacitance bitline of 60fF, together enable sufficient ±100mV cell signals. A memory cell is composed of a cell transistor and a depletion-type MOS capacitor, and the cell size is 1.5μnf. The large 4V bias to the cell node is realized by adopting a self-boost technique, which is widely used for the program inhibit of NAND flash memory. After writing the bitline BL voltage of 2V V<sub>int</sub> for ""1"" data and 0V for ""0"" data into a cell node and pulling down the wordline WL from 3.4V V<sub>pp</sub> to 2V V<sub>irιt</sub>, the plateline PL is boosted to 3.4V V<sub>pp</sub>.

The RFE (Fig. 9.7.1) is tailored to avert any external balun, or dedicated narrow-band radios, commonly found in prior arts. The featured advances are threefold: 1) a gain-boosting current-balancing balun-LNA addresses the imbalanced bias current (I<sub>cs</sub>=4I<sub>cg</sub>) and load (R<sub>cg</sub>=4R<sub>cs</sub>) conditions of the noise canceling balun-LNA, improving IIP2 and wideband output balancing while eliminating output buffers; 2) a current-reuse mixer-LPF realizes quadrature/ harmonic-rejection (HR) mixing and 3<sup>rd</sup>-order current-mode post filtering in one block, enhancing linearity and noise just where both are demanding, while saving power and area; 3) a direct injection-locked 4-/8-phase LO generator (LOG) relaxes the master LO frequency (f<sub>LO</sub>) by avoiding frequency division. A high f<sub>LO</sub> has been the speed limit of wideband RFEs with HR, where a 7.2GHz f<sub>LO</sub> is employed for 0.9GHz RF reception after divide-by-8. Here, the LOG uses 2 chains of 8-phase corrector (8PC) and 1 chain of 4-phase corrector (4PC) to optimize the phase precision in each band. A master LO<sub>in</sub> (e.g., from VCO) injection locks either one of the chains to synthesize a 4/8-phase LO<sub>out</sub> at f<sub>LO</sub>.

Two problems remain unsolved: how to remove the TX SAW at the other duplexer distances, and how to support still highly desirable 2G and 2.5G modes, required for full coverage, without increasing power consumption and system complexity. A multimode solution was addressed but 2G and 2.5G far-off noise performance was not disclosed and in 3G high band an external local oscillator signal was still used. Further multimode work has been presented, where required far off noise performance has been achieved but at the expense of the large chip area due to dedicated 2G/3G signal paths and still a high power consumption. The single-chain TX (all modes reuse the same signal path) has been focus in the work, where other advantages of a digital concept have been demonstrated, but the TX SAW filter in 3G mode cannot be omitted due to higher-than-allowed far-off noise and remaining repetition spectrum. A further single-chain TX solution based on the analog polar modulator has been disclosed, demonstrating reuse of the signal path for 2G/3G systems in an analog polar transmitter concept, but TX noise in the RX band has not been disclosed.

In addition, to comply with the OFDM transmitting mode of the IEEE 802.15.3c standards, the power amplifier (PA) must be capable to handle a peak power level 6~9dB higher than the average without sacrificing reliability. With the low supply voltage limitation of deeply scaled CMOS technologies, efficient power-combining techniques are essential. Spatial power combining is an attractive solution to meet the EIRP goal, but at the cost of spending extra power on the complex signal distribution and in order to compensate for the phase-shifter loss. Spatial power-combining solutions also occupy larger area due to the requirement of multiple antennas, minimum antenna spacing, and the transmission line feed network. On the other hand, CMOS PAs with on chip power-combining structures have achieved 18dBm of output power. However, all the combiners comprise multiple stages to achieve both impedance transformation and power combining which not only increase the insertion loss and directly degrade the efficiency, but also consume a significant amount of silicon area, rendering them far less appealing for system integration.

Examples include micro Kelvin resolution temperature sensors for wafer stepper temperature stabilization and others. In many such applications, analog-to-digital conversion is inevitable, which mandates sampling. So far, sensor interfaces have demonstrated low offset drift using chopping/auto-zeroing while preserving the intrinsic SNR of the transducer by anti-aliasing filtering before sampling. Integration with a boxcar window, or boxcar sampling, is a particularly convenient way to realize anti-aliasing filtering in the sampling process. However, implementations of the technique, due to their use of just a voltage-to-current converter whose output current is integrated over a time window, e.g. in a sigma-delta modulator, remain susceptible to gain drift resulting from either transcon-ductance or time window drift. Meanwhile, related work suggests that embedding the boxcar sampler in a feedback loop effectively removes this limitation. Whereas the loop in is closed electromechanically, the design presented here overcomes the same limitations by using a purely electrical feedback loop to establish a well-defined gain that is insensitive to boxcar sampler parameter drift.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746304","","Clocks;Converters;Feedback loop;Modulation;Noise;Resistors;Sensors","analogue-digital conversion;temperature sensors","analog-to digital interface;analog-to-digital conversion;antialiasing filtering;auto-zeroing;boxcar sampling;boxcar window;chopping;drift;electrical feedback loop;energy-efficient precision voltage sensing interfaces;microKelvin resolution temperature sensors;rail-to-rail precision voltage sensing;wafer stepper temperature stabilization","","0","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the case of the SSTL DQ bus, the series resistor of Z0/2 can suppress ringing and attenuate reflections within the chan nel. But, the SSTL DQ bus is still not entirely free from reflections among the slots because the reflection coefficient of the SSTL DQ bus at the stub junctions is -1/4. However, the IMBM DQ bus that we propose makes the reflection coef ficient 0 as can be seen from the equations. Therefore, the IMBM DQ bus generates no reflection signal at each stub. Moreover, the IMBM DQ bus can send write signals of the same current level to every module according to its current division relation of lk and lk+1. The transceiver also receives the read signal from every module with the identical level, according to the reciprocity theorem.

To isolate RX from the TX self-jammer, the RFID transceivers are generally accompanied by an off-chip circulator or isolator. This has advantages in selectivity between tag signal and blocker, but it results in a low level of integration and bulky system. In addition, to meet the stringent linearity requirement, the RFID reader needs to adopt a linear PA with sufficient power back-off, which degrades a global efficiency.

Adaptive equalizers can be implemented using data-aided or non-data-aided schemes, with the latter requiring less area and power. Previous non-data-aided adaptive schemes implement an asynchronous analog algorithm where the power spectrum of the received signal is checked for balance around a threshold frequency. Similarly, proposes a digital adaptive algorithm which is based on the detection of specific 5-bit patterns. In all three works, however, adaptation is provided only for equalizers with a single coefficient, which are suitable for well-behaved channels. In contrast, this paper presents a digital adaptive engine for an equalizer with two coefficients: one adjusting the equalizer gain at the Nyquist frequency (f<sub>N</sub>) and one at f<sub>N</sub>/2. Furthermore, the proposed engine is asynchronous; it can function when driven by a blind clock at the receiver. This is useful as it allows the adaptation process to start even when the CDR has not yet achieved lock. This also avoids a deadlock situation where the CDR and equalizer require simultaneous access to the equalized data and the recovered clock. Our measured results of the proposed adaptive equalizer in 65nm CMOS confirm that the adaptation converges to within 2.6% of the optimal vertical eye opening in less than 400 μs for two different channels at a data rate of 6 Gb/s with a 25,000 ppm frequency offset.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746351","","Adaptive equalizers;CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Frequency measurement;Radiation detectors;Receivers","CMOS integrated circuits;adaptive equalisers;clock and data recovery circuits","CMOS process;Nyquist frequency;asynchronous analog algorithm;bit rate 6 Gbit/s;digital adaptive algorithm;frequency offset;nondata-aided adaptive schemes;pattern detection;pattern-guided adaptive equalizer;power spectrum;receiver frond-end;size 65 nm;threshold frequency","","1","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has driven the rapid deployment of multiple broadband access solutions including legacy infrastructure driven DSL and cable, the almost limitless bandwidth provided by optical fiber to the home (FTTH), and the on-the-go appeal of wireless solutions including 3G/4G cellular or WiMAX. Over the past two decades, each of these technologies has successfully competed for the consumer's dollar, partly due to the differentiated ways data is accessed tel evisions were naturally connected to the CATV infrastructure and cell phones were linked to a wireless basestation. These traditional boundaries are blurring as cell phone calls are placed over WiFi networks and video content is delivered via an ISP. The common denominator is data access and the delivery method is irrelevant to the end user. As DSL continues to compete with cable and FTTH in the wireline space, more and more users are choosing wireless broadband solutions such as 3G, 4G, or WiMAX even for their home access. In this panel, we will review the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of the recent history of broadband evolution and provide a vision of the future. What are the pros and cons of each technology? Do we need so many competing solutions? What will be the successful business models in the future will everyone (or anyone) make money? Which ones will be the winners ten years from now?

To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands.

As such, finite TDC resolution can distort data modu lation and spectral mask at near integer-N channels, while finite DCO step size can add far-out spurs and phase noise. Also, a major underreported issue is an injection pulling of the DCO due to harmonics of the digital activity at closely spaced frequencies, which can also create spurs.

However, channel crosstalk is becoming a major barrier to further speed improvement. A common solution for channel crosstalk reduction at the system level is to use a shielding line or wide spacing between signal lines, but increasing the number of layers in a chip package and PCB increase system cost. To remove the shielding lines and increase speed, this paper presents a channel crosstalk equalizer with programmable signal ordering capability for the DRAM transmitter.

The CNB provides an interface to a sin gle 64b DDR3 memory channel, which can operate at up to DDR3-1066. The Fusion architecture implements an efficient form of unified memory architecture (UMA) where a portion of system memory is reserved as graphics frame buffer memory.

While EMS may offer monitoring, reporting, and control of energy usage, these functions simply track intermittently the energy consumption and operational states of certain appliances and equipments. Further, since their sensing devices are not small, they cannot be attached to every appliance or piece of equipment. Some EMSs gather information, rather, at the power-distribution-board level or the multi-output-tap level. We report here a TX-integrated battery-free real-time current-waveform sensor. It is small enough to be attached to any piece of equipment for continuous power-consumption monitoring. Its key features are : 1) plugless energy harvesting (EH) from AC power lines, 2) real-time sensing and transmitting that use a half-cycle time-to-digital converter (TDC) to detect detailed information on current-wave forms with the precise time-resolution, and 3) asymmetrical power consumption, which helps to achieve high-power RF transmission with a limited EH power supply. Our sensor provides the 1mW power supply from an EH unit, as well as the -5.5dBm RF output power at the 50kS/s sampling with a 1mW EH power supply.

This results from the low breakdown voltage of transistors, high on-chip passive loss on a conductive substrate, stringent bump-pattern constraints and thermal dissipation requirements of flip-chip packages. Most fully-integrated linear CMOS PAs reported to date were either fabricated on a relatively mature process (65nm or above) in a wire-bonded die with relatively high supply voltage (3.3V), or exhibited low power efficiency when backed-off. In many cases, digital pre-distortion was implemented to improve linearity and efficiency. We present a 1.8V single-chip CMOS PA with 21dBm average output power and 16% PAE while meeting -25dB EVM for 64-QAM OFDM signal without digital pre-distortion linearization in 32nm SoC CMOS on a flip-chip package. This per formance is enabled by: 1) On-chip shielded concentric transformers with power-splitting/combining structures to fit the design within the bump pattern constraint and thermal dissipation requirement of an SoC flip-chip package and to enhance power handling capability; 2) Minimum phase distortion by opti mized inter-stage power matching allowed by the high fmax of the minimum channel-length device.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746381","","CMOS integrated circuits;Current measurement;OFDM;Power amplifiers;Power generation;System-on-a-chip;Transistors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;OFDM modulation;electric breakdown;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit packaging;lead bonding;power amplifiers;power transistors;quadrature amplitude modulation;system-on-chip;transformers","QAM OFDM signal;SoC CMOS technology;class-AB power amplifier;conductive substrate;digital pre-distortion linearization;flip-chip-package;interstage power matching;minimum phase distortion;minimum-channel-length device;monolithic linear high-power amplifier;on-chip passive loss;power handling capability;power-splitting-combining structure;shielded concentric transformer;size 32 nm;size 65 nm;stringent bump-pattern constraint;thermal dissipation;transistor breakdown voltage;voltage 1.8 V;voltage 3.3 V;wire-bonded die","","4","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several low-power techniques have been proposed, but all of them incur transistor-count penalties, leading to an increase in size, which is too costly since flip-flops typically account for 50% of random-logic area. In this work, we design and test a D-flip-flop, known as adaptive-coupling flip-flop (ACFF), which has a reduced transistor count compared to other low-power flip-flops, and 2 fewer transistors than the mainstream transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF). ACFF features a single-phase clocking structure, with no local clock buffer and no precharging stage, enabling it to be more energy efficient than TGFF, where up to 77% energy saving is achieved at 0% data activity. ACFF also has an adaptive-coupling configuration, which weakens state retention coupling during a transition, allowing it to be tolerant to process variations. Test chips are fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology for 1.1V application, and 500k ACFFs are tested over all chips in 5 skew wafers. All tested ACFFs are fully functional down to 0.75V supply voltage, with spreads of timing parameters comparable to TGFF.

The out-of-band peaking is deliberately set to help the stability and to allow larger input signals to be processed by the loop. This modulator achieves 78.2dB peak SNDR and 79.3dB peak SNR while consuming 1.35mW analog and 1.55mW digital power from 1.5V supplies.

In modern cellular phones, transmit SAW filters have been largely eliminated with innovative TX architecture and circuits [1] while receive SAW filters are still present. This remains as one of the few bottlenecks in achieving a true low-cost single-chip solution which offers a genuine advantage for high-volume applications. The main challenges of eliminating SAW-based bandpass filters from multiband 2G/2.5G receivers lie in noise-figure (NF) degradation and gain desensitization induced by OdBm blockers at merely 20MHz away from the 99dBm in-band signal at GSM850/900 band.

However, research conducted in the past decade has enabled commercially available cellular switching CMOS PAs for constant envelope modulation such as GSM applications. This successful implementation of a GSM PA called forth a demand for a combination of linear EDGE operation with GSM operation in order to increase data rate up to 384kb/s while using legacy infrastructures. The challenges of implementation of a dual-mode CMOS PA arise from required linearity for high peak-to-average-power ratio, which forces the PA to operate at power back-off from the P<sub>1dB</sub> and results in inevitable low efficiency. Although a CMOS EDGE/GSM PA was reported in the past, the application was intended for Class-E3 operation.

Using passive components as delay elements can relax this issue to some extent, but the untunable delay is quite vulnerable to PVT variations.

An adaptive analog equalizer or adaptive DFE is also attractive to compensate the frequency-dependent loss due to the different channel lengths and environment variations. Conventionally, a multiple-tap DFE is adopted to compensate the inter-symbol interference (ISI), which is induced by postcursors due to the non-ideal channel impulse responses. To avoid the power and area penalty due to many postcursors, a DFE with infinite impulse response (MR) filter feedback has been presented. In [B. Kim et al., 2009], no adaptation scheme ensures that such MR filter cancels the postcursors precisely, i.e., its RC time constant and amplitude need to be manually adjusted. In this work, a 6Gb/s receiver using a DFE with an adaptive continuous-time MR filter and a clock/data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented. In a high loss environment, a conventional digital qaudricor relator frequency detector (QFD) may fail due to the significant data dependent jitter. To integrate an adaptive DFE with a CDR circuit, a proposed frequency sweeping frequency detector (FD) and a lock detector (LD) are presented in this work.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746352","","Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Detectors;Frequency measurement;IIR filters;Jitter;Receivers","IIR filters;clock and data recovery circuits;intersymbol interference","adaptive DFE-IIR equalization;adaptive analog equalizer;adaptive continuous-time MR filter;channel impulse response;clock/data recovery circuit;data dependent jitter;decision feedback equalizer;digital qaudricor relator frequency detector;frequency sweeping frequency detector;frequency-dependent loss;high speed data transmission;infinite impulse response filter feedback;intersymbol interference;lock detector;lossy channel;receiver;signal integrity","","0","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This trend motivates per core/block dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with fast voltage transition. Given the high cost and bulk of off-chip DC/DC converters to implement multiple on-chip power domains, there has been a surge of interest in on-chip converters. This paper presents the design and experimental results of a fully integrated 3-level DC/DC converter that merges characteristics of both inductor-based buck and switched-capacitor (SC) converters. While off-chip buck converters show high conversion efficiency, their on-chip counterparts suffer from loss due to low quality inductors. With the help of flying capacitors, the 3-level converter requires smaller inductors than the buck converter, reducing loss and on-die area overhead. Compared to SC converters that need more com plex structures to regulate higher than half the input voltage, 3-level converters can efficiently regulate the output voltage across a wide range of levels and load currents.

On/off commutation dead-times should be adjusted care fully in accordance with load current change.

Mobile phones, to be usable globally, are therefore required to support many bands. The lack of suitable tuneable pre-selection filters and duplexers mandates the use of a large number of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) in the receiver section of the transceiver. Minimization of the area occupied by the LNAs is therefore important. Virtually every transceiver for mobile phone applications published to date makes use of LNAs employing on-chip or on-passivation spiral inductors. Spiral inductors are large and do not scale with technology, leading to an increasing relative cost of the receiver front-end with newer technology nodes. Post-passivation and SiP technologies also add noticeably to the costs. In this paper we present the first receiver employing no on-chip or above-passivation spiral inductors on the receive signal path and with a linearity and noise performance suitable for WCDMA/EDGE applications.

Due to the battery voltage variation during usage and the wide-range dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) applied for power reduction, high-efficiency buck-boost conversion is required to extend the battery lifetime. The buck-boost converter selects the operation mode by comparing the output with the supply voltage, which is not suitable for multioutput converters. The reported single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck-boost converter uses a state machine with sophisticated current sense for mode selection and requires a freewheeling state that dissipates energy. The converter uses one additional auxiliary inductor for step-up/down mode adjustment. This paper proposes an extended-PWM (EPWM) control which automatically selects buck or boost mode and facilitates smooth mode transition.

In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses the integration of a 60GHz CMOS single-chip transmitter and a single- chip receiver using a standard 90nm CMOS technology demonstrating a reliable solution for 60GHz single-chip radio. Proper transistor layout, complete and accurate modeling and optimized parasitic extraction method enabled the robust design of the wideband super-heterodyne architecture to support the entire 57- to-66GHz band. The analog radio front-end is controlled by a serial digital interface and has been co-designed and integrated together with a high-speed digital signal processor including analog-to-digital conversion, high speed PHY signal processing such as frequency-offset compensation, phase tracking, FIR and DFE, to support both advanced OFDM and SCBT modulation scheme. The resulting single-chip solution enables data throughputs exceeding 7Gb/s (QPSK) and 15Gb/s (16QAM) for a total DC power budget of below 200mW in TDD operation.

The space-filling-curve flexibly distributes the fine clock even to an irregular area. The short latency without hierarchy results in low jitter and low skew. The curve is finally connected to the starting point to obtain a large loop. It reduces the load inductor by half and the reduction reduces the area penalty.

To achieve high memory bandwidth, various techniques such as widening input/output pins shrinking the unit array size, and performing a read operation and a write operation concurrently have been reported. However, these embedded DRAM macros incur considerable area penalty to obtain high memory bandwidth. Among the techniques for achieving high bandwidth, the concurrent read/write operation is a very effective method in performing a read-modify-write function and a double-buffer function for the graphics applications. A pseudo-two-port embedded DRAM macro that performs concurrent read/write operations at high frequency without sacrificing cell efficiency is reported in this paper. To accomplish this, a read/write cross-point switch circuit (RWCC) and distributed steering redundancy switches (DSRS) are introduced.

IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","212","608","In a WCDMA FDD system, since the transmitter and receiver operate concurrently, the receiver is plagued by the transmitter leakage due to finite isolation of antenna duplexer. As a consequence, the transmitter noise at the receive band degrades the sensitivity, unless the noise is further attenuated before reaching the receiver. Due to the modest Q of on-chip inductors, typically the use of a costly SAW filter placed before the PA is inevitable. On the other hand, the external filter may be eliminated through sufficiently lowering the transmitter noise for any given duplexer. However, given the power-noise trade off, in all previous designs due to the lack of an on-chip filtering mechanism, meeting the stringent noise requirement has resulted in an excessive transmitter power dissipation. To address these issues, a feedback-based filtering technique to suppress the receive-band noise with negligible area or power penalty is presented. Stability analysis reveals that with practical transmitter gain distribution, optimum component sizes, and for a typical required noise suppression, using a simple first- or second-order RC LPF, the feedback remains stable and no additional compensation is required.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523132","","Degradation;Filtering;Inductors;Multiaccess communication;Power dissipation;Receiving antennas;SAW filters;Stability analysis;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas","code division multiple access;notch filters;radio transmitters","SAW filter;antenna duplexer;code division multiple access;filtering technique;integrated notch filter;low-power WCDMA transmitter;on-chip inductors;power-noise trade off;stability analysis;transmitter leakage","","8","4","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Expensive scaled CMOS processes are readily used as a technology enabler to provide adequate performance. The high implementation cost of circuits in such processes is justified by the added functionality of the circuits, however it also drives the desire for low-area solutions in standard digital CMOS. For example, low-area inductor-less LNAs take advantage of the high ft of scaled CMOS. Unfortunately, stringent phase noise requirements make inductors unavoidable in VCOs. This leads to solutions with area-demanding multiple- inductor synthesizers or spur-hazardous multiply-and-divide sections to cover the wide frequency range required for multi- standard receivers. In this work, we demonstrate a low-area multi-standard direct downconversion receiver front-end that uses a single-inductor dual-band VCO and is implemented in 90 nm digital CMOS.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523188","","Application software;CMOS digital integrated circuits;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Cost function;Dual band;Inductors;Phase noise;Synthesizers;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;inductors;radio receivers;voltage-controlled oscillators","area-demanding multiple- inductor synthesizers;digital CMOS process;multiband front-end;multistandard receivers;single-inductor dual-band VCO;size 90 nm;software-defined multistandard radios;spur-hazardous multiply-and-divide sections;voltage-controlled oscillators","","4","1","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper shows the P/E cycle dependence of the threshold-voltage distribution and program/erase time. The threshold-voltage distribution does not degrade, and maintains enough margin to the wordline level (4.5 V) even after 1M P/E cycles. Erase time is 10 ms/block (average) for the first P/E cycle and 20 ms/block (average) after 1M P/E cycles. This is almost the same erase performance as on-board EEPROM, due to the DCNOR structure that does not use the read channel during program operation. On the other hand, program time increase is caused by charge trapping at tunnel oxide, but program time is 500 mus/word (average) even after 1M P/E cycles. The threshold-voltage shift value is only -1V after 1000 hr bake at Ta = 250 degC.

In the circuit, the delay of each stage is a linear superposition of the delays Phi of the associated inner and outer loop elements. If the outer loop element inputs are made independent, the driven oscillator is resulted. Provided the input drive is sufficient, the frequency of the driven oscillator is that of the driving input, and the phase of each internal node is an interpolation of the phase of its input drive and the phase of the preceding stage. This interpolation acts to average offsets from quadrature in the incoming phases. If the input drive is insufficient, the oscillator will run near its natural or unloaded frequency, omega<sub>0</sub>=2pif<sub>o</sub>.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523255","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Cutoff frequency;Delay;Design optimization;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Predictive models;Ring oscillators;Transceivers","clocks;interpolation;oscillators","4-stage ring oscillator;cascaded quad corrector stages;linear superposition;open-loop quadrature clock generator;outer loop element inputs","","4","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In PONs, the fast-locked CDR circuit must lock within tens of bit times once the data packets arrive. The so-called burst-mode CDR (BMCDR) circuits with gated VCOs (GVCOs) have been presented. To meet the requirements of different PON standards, a multi-band BMCDR circuit is very desirable. The conventional multi-band technique is realized by a GVCO with dividers. Since the GVCO has to operate at the highest speed, it dissipates a fixed power, even though only a low data rate is required. Furthermore, the dividers introduce extra time delays to reduce the sampling margin that may become an issue for high data rates. In this work, a 20/10/5/2.5Gb/s power-scaling BMCDR circuit is implemented in 90nm CMOS technology. It is aimed to scale the power of a BMCDR circuit for different data rates. To realize a power-scaling multi-band BMCDR circuit, a tri-mode cell can be configured as a GVCO, a divide-by-2 divider, or 2 DFFs. Moreover, improvements are made to address the problem associated with the extra time delays that reduce the sampling margin.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523138","","CMOS logic circuits;Clocks;Delay effects;Latches;Logic circuits;Multiplexing;Phase locked loops;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device measurement;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;optical burst switching;optical fibre networks;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS technology;GVCO/Div2/DFF tri-mode cells;PON standards;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s;bit rate 20 Gbit/s;bit rate 5 Gbit/s;data packets;fast-locked CDR circuit;gated voltage controlled oscillator;multiband BMCDR circuit;passive optical network;power-scaling burst-mode CDR circuit;size 90 nm","","5","2","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current sensing gain can be increased and and the circuit is less sensitive to switching noise than CPM converters are because the slope compensation used in CPM converters reduces the current sensing gain to comply with low supply voltage.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523249","","Capacitors;DC-DC power converters;Feedback loop;Fluctuations;Inductors;Load management;Power generation;Switches;Switching converters;Voltage","BiCMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;circuit feedback;comparators (circuits);power integrated circuits","comparator;current sensing gain;freewheeling current feedback;load-independent control;power BiCMOS process;single-inductor bipolar-output converter;single-inductor multiple-output converters;size 0.5 mum;slope compensation;switching DC-DC converters;switching noise","","9","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","358","619","This paper introduces a fully integrated 2x2 two-stream MIMO radio SoC that integrates all of the functions of an 802.11n WLAN. The 0.13 mum CMOS radio SoC, which integrates two dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) RF transceivers, analog baseband filters, data converters, digital physical layer, media access controller, and a PCI Express interface, provides a low-cost low-power small-form-factor WLAN solution. The MIMO radio comprises two identical dual-band transceivers that share a common frequency synthesizer capable of operating in both integer-N and fractional-N modes. In 2.4 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a direct-conversion architecture with a 3.2 GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Direct conversion is used primarily because of its simplicity and the area reduction it offers by eliminating the need for an IF path. A 3.2 GHz synthesizer frequency is used to avoid VCO pulling. The 3.2 GHz synthesizer output f<sub>vco</sub> is divided by two and then mixed with the original 3.2 GHz f<sub>vco</sub> to generate a 4.8 GHz frequency. This 4.8 GHz signal at twice the RF frequency is distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver, the 4.8 GHz signal is divided by two to generate the 2.4 GHz in-phase and quadrature LO signals. In the 5 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a sliding-IF dual-conversion architecture, in which the RF and IF LO signals are centered at 2/3 fRF and 1/3 fRF, respectively. The frequency synthesizer, operating in integer-N mode, thus provides a 3.2 GHz RF LO signal that is buffered and distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver a resistively loaded divide-by-two circuit is used to generate the quadrature LO signals at 1/3 fRF. The channel center frequencies in the 5 GHz band allow integer-N operation of the synthesizer with a relatively high reference frequency, thus improving the phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523205","","Baseband;Digital filters;Dual band;Frequency synthesizers;MIMO;RF signals;Radio frequency;Signal generators;Transceivers;Wireless LAN","CMOS integrated circuits;MIMO communication;system-on-chip;transceivers;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN;VCO pulling;direct conversion architecture;dual-band CMOS MIMO radio SoC;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency 5 GHz;size 0.13 mum;synthesizer frequency;transceivers","","21","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is promising for this purpose. A PWM pixel can convert light intensity to a digital pulse width by using an in-pixel comparator with a low power-supply voltage without any degradation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a low-power dynamic pixel readout in-pixel comparators(DPR) scheme with CGA PWM pixels based on dynamic operation of in-pixel comparators. DPR requires no static bias current even in the pixel readout. The power dissipation of the pixel array is dramatically reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with using normal static pixel readout (SPR).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523053","","Biomedical imaging;CMOS image sensors;CMOS logic circuits;Cameras;Communication system security;Logic circuits;Low voltage;Pixel;Pulse width modulation;Space vector pulse width modulation","CMOS image sensors;comparators (circuits);pulse width modulation;readout electronics","DPR;PWM CMOS imager;SNR;SPR;dynamic pixel readout;in-pixel comparators;pixel array;pulse width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;static pixel readout;submicron logic circuits;voltage 1.35 V","","5","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, semiconductor technology has been in the lead in the reduction of power consumption, by facilitating energy monitoring, and the controlling and managing of energy consumption.

That the MCU uses very little power was demonstrated for the first time by Renesas in 2006, by operating a low-power MCU from the electricity generated by 4 lemons! Subseqently, in 2011, we succeeded in operating our latest low-power MCU for 3 hours and 45 minutes using one lemon as a power source. Yet, in the future, MCUs must evolve further to save power, in widespread applications including the ""energy harvesting"" environment.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176866","","Air pollution;Energy harvesting;Green products;Power demand;Protocols;Sensors;Vehicles","energy consumption;energy harvesting;environmental factors;microcontrollers","MCU;energy consumption control;energy consumption management;energy harvesting environment;energy monitoring;microcontroller;microelectronics;power consumption reduction;power saving;semiconductor device;semiconductor technology","","6","","13","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They also offer higher-frequency performance than SC modulators as no critical opamp settling is required. CT modulators with low OSR have achieved a DR greater than 75 dB in a 20 MHz band. However, they all suffer from inaccurate active filtering as filter time constants are set by RC and C/Gm values that vary by as much as plusmn20 to 30%. By lowering OSR, the signal band can be widened, but the in-band zero of the NTF should be optimally placed to maximize the DR. Inaccurate NTF zero either degrades the DR or makes the modulator unstable. This work presents an exact time-constant auto-tuning method using an LMS algorithm. With a binary pulse dither injected into the loop at the input of the quantizer, the filter time constant can be calibrated continuously with crystal accuracy until the correlated residual pulse dither disappears in the digital output.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523276","","Active filters;Bandwidth;Capacitors;Delay;Digital filters;Feedback loop;Frequency;Power harmonic filters;Pulse modulation;Sampling methods","CMOS integrated circuits;continuous time systems;delta-sigma modulation;tuning","CMOS technology;automatic tuning;bandwidth 8 MHz;continuous time delta-sigma modulators;pulse injection;size 65 nm","","3","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analog on-sensor processing solutions feature image sensor integration. However, the precision loss of analog signal processing prevents those solutions from realizing complex algorithms, and they lack flexibility. Vision processors realize high GOPS numbers by combining a processor array for parallel operations and a decision processor for other ones. Converting from parallel data in the processor array to scalar in the decision processor creates a throughput bottleneck. Parallel memory accesses also lead to high power consumption.

An extra phase is needed, but, surprisingly, there is no speed penalty when compared to a high-gain opamp solution because CLS does not require full settling during the next-to-last phase. In fact, the increased signal swing means that the same SNR can be achieved using smaller sampling capacitors. Thus, it could be argued that CLS can provide accurate results at a higher speed than using a traditional 2-phase operation with a high-gain opamp. For example, with CLS, the performance is maintained over the whole 0.9V supply, whereas a standard configuration has only a 0.6V swing. Thus, the standard configuration requires 2.25x larger sampling capacitors to achieve the same signal to kT/C noise ratio.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523296","","Capacitors;Distortion measurement;Performance gain;Phase estimation;Rails;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device noise;Signal to noise ratio;Solid state circuits;Voltage","amplification;capacitors;operational amplifiers","correlated level shifting;finite opamp gain;high-gain opamp solution;loop gain;rail-to-rail operation;sampling capacitors","","7","4","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contributing to the relatively high WCDMA terminal cost is the low integration of today's WCDMA radios. Since WCDMA is an FDD system the transmitter and receiver are on simultaneously. A duplexer is used to isolate the receiver from the transmit signal but the isolation of small low-cost duplexers is limited, with a guaranteed isolation at the TX frequency of not more than 52dB. For a Class-3 terminal with 2dB TX path loss due to duplexer and switch, the power at the PA output is +26dBm and the receiver will see a TX leakage of up to -26dBm. Today's state-of- the-art WCDMA transceivers deal with the TX blocking problem by using an external TX SAW filter to eliminate TX noise in the RX band and an external LNA and RX SAW filter to achieve sufficient RX linearity. A typical tri-band transceiver requires 6 SAW filters and 3 LNAs. The tri-band WCDMA transceiver presented here eliminates all external SAW filters and LNAs and achieves excellent performance with standard low-cost duplexers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523127","","Baseband;Calibration;Current supplies;Detectors;Multiaccess communication;Power control;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Receivers;SAW filters;Transceivers","code division multiple access;multiplexing equipment;power control;transceivers","FDD system;RX SAW filter;RX band;RX linearity;TX blocking problem;WCDMA transceivers;external LNA;external SAW filters;integrated TX power control;single-chip triband WCDMA-HSDPA transceiver;small low-cost duplexer;triband transceiver","","35","15","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a trade off between these two requirements, as the use of resonant loads offers high power efficiency while an inductor-free approach saves die area resulting in a cheaper design. Since an LC-oscillator topology is mandatory to achieve a minimal current draw, the reduction of the number of coils has to be done in the LNA, the mixer and the quadrature generator. In this work, starting from the LNA-Mixer and VCO (LMV) cell topology, a single-coil low-power receiver shares the bias current among all the RF blocks of the analog front-end.

The ITRS roadmap projects that the aggressive device size scaling will result in supply voltage reductions to well below IV, in particular for low-power technologies. The use of alternative energy sources also requires ULV operation in some applications. Achieving sufficient linearity with low power consumption is very challenging for the ULV mixer and baseband circuits. The on-chip LO generation and distribution is difficult due to the low-voltage device bias. We present optimized mixer and filter topologies, and a polyphase LO buffer, used in a low-power ULV receiver for 2.4GHz applications like Bluetooth or Zigbee. The use of spiral inductors is kept to a minimum to avoid their excessive area.

Thus, the ADC achieves low-power operation without sacrificing speed or accuracy.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523150","","Capacitors;Clocks;Feedback;Frequency measurement;Linearity;Merging;Pipelines;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device measurement;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;digital-analogue conversion;low-power electronics;sample and hold circuits","MDAC;dual gate-oxide CMOS technology;frequency 46 MHz;low-power operation;merged active S-H;pipelined ADC;power 230 mW;power saving;size 0.18 mum;voltage 3 V","","3","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","78","597","Receiving a high-power optical signal using a linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is often a very difficult task. Large input photocurrents saturate the TIA and make it insensitive to the input signal. This is especially a problem for optical sensing applications, in which the input photocurrent usually has a very wide dynamic range (DR). Various methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. The 2-stage compression concepts described here significantly improve. The DR is increased by 18 dB compared and by 10 dB. Moreover, the compression is monotonic over the full input current range. The proposed TIA responds linearly to the input currents that are smaller than the first break-point current, while larger currents are logarithmically compressed to avoid the saturation of the TIA. The lower bound on the input DR is given by the equivalent RMS input-noise and it is affected by the TIA transimpedance, which is set by the feedback resistor in the TIA. However, the BW is indirectly proportional to the transimpedance of the TIA, and therefore its minimum of 250 MHz is in the linear region, in which the overall transimpedance. Using the 2-stage compression concept, we simultaneously achieved a low equivalent RMS input-current noise of 58 nA and a very-high overdrive of 200 mA. This concept is also well suited for LAN technologies, optical data-storage systems, wireless IR links and free-space optics.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523065","","High power amplifiers;Monitoring;Optical amplifiers;Optical feedback;Optical noise;Optical saturation;Optical sensors;Photoconductivity;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Stimulated emission","amplifiers;optical information processing;optical sensors;photodiodes","2-stage compression;dynamic range transimpedance amplifier;high-current monitor;high-power optical signal;monotonic logarithmic compression;optical sensing application","","0","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-resolution TDCs become increasingly popular for time-of-flight measurements, full-speed testing, e.g., jitter measurement, clock and data recovery, measurement and instrumentation, and digital PLLs. As the speed leverage of technology scaling decreases below 100nm, robust TDCs with sub-gate-delay resolution are essential. The Vernier TDC requires long delay lines, thus suffers from large latency, area and power consumption. Latency and a resolution limited by the inherent variation-related pulse-width modification are the drawbacks of the pulse-shrinking approach. Parallel gradual-delay elements are particularly susceptible to process variations. The same holds for analog operations on time intervals like delay amplification.

I/Q and DC precompensation is then applied, to eliminate the image and LO components at the RF output. A first fine digital gain stage controls the signal level in a 0 to -12 dB range. The baseband signal is then upsampled to F<sub>c</sub>/4, where F<sub>c</sub> is the carrier frequency in the 2.4 to 2.7 GHz range. As the ratio between F<sub>c</sub>/4 and FM is not necessarily integer, a fractional-N interpolator has to be used. The interpolating ratio has 17 bits of resolution, which allows carrier frequencies on a 25 kHz raster, to satisfy all possible WiFi and WiMAX channel allocations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523206","","Baseband;Channel allocation;Digital control;Finite impulse response filter;Image sampling;Mobile handsets;Radio frequency;Radio spectrum management;Transmitters;WiMAX","CMOS digital integrated circuits;WiMax;digital-analogue conversion;mobile handsets;radio transmitters","2G mobile handsets;3G mobile handsets;DC precompensation;FIR interpolators;RF transmitter;WiFi/WiMAX bands;carrier frequency;delta-sigma RF DAC;digital CMOS transmitter;digital-analog conversion;fractional-N interpolator;frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.7 GHz;frequency 5.4 GHz;size 65 nm","","12","2","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the passive termination resistor inevitably becomes an additional load for the output driver, which results in significant decrease of the modulation current range.To enable low-cost and flexible CMOS solutions, this paper presents a low-voltage design topology of active back-termination by incorporating the design techniques described above.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523137","","Circuit topology;Driver circuits;Equations;Impedance;MOS devices;Optical reflection;Radio frequency;Resistors;Transmission lines;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;network topology;semiconductor lasers","CMOS;active back-termination;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;laser-diode driver;low-voltage design topology;optical transmitter;size 0.18 mum","","1","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has resulted in many recent initiatives to fabricate CMOS-based microelectrodes for the stimulation and recording of electrical activity of neurons. CMOS technology offers the potential for monolithic integration of sensors and electronics and it serves as an appropriate platform to facilitate the integration of large arrays of sensors into a small geometry. The extracellular pH of a cell culture is a particularly important indicator of global cellular metabolism, but up until now, this property has typically been measured with invasive and expensive techniques such as miniaturized glass microelectrodes, fluorescent ratio imaging microscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CMOS provides a scalable, low cost, mass manufacturing platform, and offers the potential to develop sensor arrays that can perform non-invasive and long term imaging on cultured cells. In this paper, we present the first 16x16 proton camera array for direct imaging of the hydrogen-ion activity of cell cultures grown in vitro. The proton camera is based on a single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) sensor array technology that can be implemented using a standard commercial CMOS process.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523321","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Cameras;Extracellular;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic sensors;Microelectrodes;Protons;Sensor arrays;Silicon","CMOS image sensors;biosensors;cellular biophysics;ion sensitive field effect transistors;microelectrodes","CMOS proton camera array;CMOS-based microelectrodes;cell culture;cultured cells;direct extracellular imaging;electrical activity;extracellular pH;global cellular metabolism;hydrogen-ion activity;long term imaging;microelectronics industry;monolithic integration;noninvasive imaging;silicon CMOS technology;single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor sensor array technology","","5","70","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fingerprint identification using capacitive fingerprint sensing provides small user-authentication systems. For systems that need a higher level of security, fraud detection, which determines whether the sensed finger is alive or not, is necessary. Integrating fraud detection capability into a capacitive sensor is important because attempted fraud has to be detected at the same time that the fingerprint is captured. Various methods that use information about a finger, such as its electrical characteristics, optical characteristics or elastic characteristics, have been tried. Impedance-sensing is suitable from the viewpoint of using electrical signals. An impedance-sensing circuit should not increase the chip size nor degrade the quality of the captured fingerprint image. To meet these requirements, we propose an impedance-sensing scheme built into a capacitive sensor and implemented as a circuit and electrode without changing the chip size.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523111","","Capacitive sensors;Circuits;Degradation;Electric variables;Fingerprint recognition;Fingers;Image matching;Impedance;Information security;Optical sensors","capacitive sensors;electric impedance measurement;fingerprint identification;fraud;image sensors","artificial finger;capacitive fingerprint sensing;capacitive sensor;elastic characteristics;electrical characteristics;electrical signals;fingerprint identification;fingerprint sensor;impedance sensing;integrating fraud detection;optical characteristics;user-authentication systems","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","274","613","As silicon technology scales, the possibility of fabricating dense memories is of great interest, particularly if the solution has low to no additional process cost. We demonstrate a 2Mb 2T gain-cell macro with 128GB/s bandwidth, fast 2ns cycle time, operating at 2GHz in a native 65nm logic process. Fast read access and cycle times are critical in lookup applications such as tag RAMs in microprocessors where read queries are abundant. In such a scenario replacing SRAM with a denser fast memory is desired. The 2T fully pipelined gain-cell macro features non-destructive read, partial-write support and sustains 8-cycle successive access to the same memory bank. The macro is fabricated in a high-performance 65nm process featuring 1.2nm nitrided gate oxide, 35nm gate length, enhanced channel strain, NiSi silicide, 8 layers of Cu metal interconnect, and low-K ILD enabling data-buses from the memory banks to run as high as 2GHz. This technology has a 0.57 mum<sup>2</sup> 6T SRAM cell. All internal circuits of the macro operate with a logic-compatible nominal IV supply with the exception of wordline drivers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523163","","Bandwidth;Capacitive sensors;Costs;Driver circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Silicides;Silicon","SRAM chips;logic design","2T fully pipelined gain-cell macro;2T gain-cell memory macro;6T SRAM cell;cycle times;frequency 2 GHz;logic process;lookup applications;memory bank;nitrided gate oxide;read access time;silicon technology;size 65 nm;storage capacity 2 Mbit;time 2 ns;wordline drivers","","11","2","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While eDRAMs have 2.5x to 4x density compared to SRAMs and have lower soft-error rate they are slower in operation. In a conventional DRAM with a single column access device for read and write, a write operation is started only after the bitline sense amplifiers are turned on and the bitlines are well on their way to full restoration. This is to avoid destroying data due to premature access to global bitlines in the non-writing columns. This delay in the write operation increases row cycle time to allow the storage node to be fully written. Accelerating write cycle with early access only in the required columns requires a large area penalty because local sense amplifiers in one bank are usually grouped into a large block where all control signals are shared. Also an embedded DRAM in a standard 65 nm twin-tub SOI CMOS process that uses a local sense amplifier with V<sub>DD</sub> sensing and separate ports for read and write, with these operations synchronized with sensing is described. This eDRAM speeds up the row cycle with low area overhead by reducing the number of signals to control the ports and making write and read operations indistinguishable at the bank level.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523161","","Built-in self-test;Capacitors;Graphics;Random access memory;Reservoirs;Testing;Timing;Tin;Turning;Variable structure systems","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip","SoC integration;bitline sense amplifier;frequency 500 MHz;random-access embedded DRAM macro;size 65 nm;storage capacity 1 Mbit;twin-tub SOI CMOS process","","11","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is seen that in the band where the distributed effect of the DA is in action, the ratio of the forward to reverse gain is substantial (and depends on the number of stages used). The input and output blocks are connected to this core stage to provide matching and stability This method is different from other techniques that improve gain (e.g., cascade of DAs or matrix amplifier) in that it uses a new internal feedback to fed signals go through one DA twice. The input, core and output DA blocks consist of 4/3/3 gain elements respectively except that the core DA uses series input capacitances at the gates for BW enhancement and biasing purposes. Terminations Z<sub>x</sub> and Z<sub>y</sub> are chosen to minimize undesired reflections. The input and output biases are fed through appropriate bias tees. The lower cutoff of the DA is set at 12 GHz for our application in a wideband mm-wave imaging module. This frequency could be extended to frequencies close to 1 GHz if appropriate AC-coupling capacitors are used.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523124","","CMOS technology;Distributed amplifiers;Feedback;Frequency measurement;Impedance;Noise figure;Phased arrays;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device modeling;Topology","CMOS integrated circuits;distributed amplifiers;feedback amplifiers;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave imaging;wideband amplifiers","AC-coupling capacitor;CMOS;DA;broadband distributed amplifier;frequency 660 GHz;internal feedback;wideband mm-wave imaging module","","12","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent work has shown the use of SC-filtering techniques in radio receivers, where sampling is done early in the RX path. Such discrete-time architectures require an early anti-aliasing (AA) filter prior to sampling. Multiple AA and channel filters with decimation stages have been used to strongly attenuate alias and adjacent channels and to allow sampling of the signal at a reasonable rate at the ADC stage.IF amplifiers are necessary to drive ADC input stage. The direct-conversion receiver architecture proposed here is based on a fully-passive CMOS approach.

Therefore, the search continues for a more efficient solution. One possibility is to harness the high efficiency of a saturated power amplifier but somehow make it deliver amplitude-modulated waveforms.

FBDIMM systems potentially increase the memory latency.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523257","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Fabrics;Jitter;Phase measurement;Switches;Transceivers;Transmitters","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS memory circuits;buffer storage;low-power electronics;transceivers","bit rate 115 Gbit/s;demultiplexing;fully buffered DIMM;low-latency low-power high-speed serial link;multiplexing;pass-through mode;power 1.8 W;programmable elastic buffer;size 90 nm;standard CMOS logic;transceiver","","0","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An SoC for mobile phones defines 23 hierarchical power domains but most of the power domains are assigned for peripheral IPs that mainly use low-leakage high-V<sub>t</sub> transistors. Since high-performance multiprocessor SoCs use leaky low-V<sub>t</sub> transistors for CPU sections, leakage power savings of these CPU sections is a primary objective. We develop an SoC with 8 processor cores and 8 user RAMs (1 per core) targeted for power-efficient high-performance embedded applications. We assign these 16 blocks to separate power domains so that they can be independently be powered off. A resume mode is also introduced where the power of the CPU is off and the user RAM is on for fast resume operation. An automatic parallelizing compiler schedules tasks for each CPU core and also performs power management for each CPU core. With the help of this compiler, each processor core can operate at a different frequency or even dynamically stop the clock to maintain processing performance while reducing average operating power consumption. The compiler also executes power-off control of unnecessary CPU cores.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523071","","Automatic control;CMOS technology;Clocks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency synchronization;Leakage current;Optimizing compilers;Registers;Resumes","embedded systems;logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallelising compilers;random-access storage;system-on-chip","8640 MIPS SoC;CPU core;RAM;automatic parallelizing compiler;embedded application;hierarchical power domain;high-performance multiprocessor SoC;mobile phones;power efficient SoC design;power management;power-off control;processor cores","","12","","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous asynchronous rectifiers use MOS switches to avoid the diode drop, however they lack the ability to efficiently rectify the multiple output phases generated from a disk-shaped transducer.

To minimize the overall size of the power supply, the generator has to work at its maximum power point. Due to varying thermal conditions, the generated power and voltage are not constant. Typically the output voltage is lower than the power supply voltage of the sensor. For these reasons, a power management circuit (PMC) with maximum power-point tracking capability and containing a DC/DC-converter with variable conversion factor is required that stores the generated energy in a rechargeable battery or capacitor.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523176","","Circuits;Electrical equipment industry;Electricity supply industry;Power generation;Power supplies;Sensor systems;Thermal sensors;Thermoelectricity;Voltage;Wireless sensor networks","DC-DC power convertors;power supply circuits;thermoelectric conversion;wireless sensor networks","DC/DC-converter;ambient environmental energy;capacitive power-management circuit;capacitor;compact power supply;electrical energy;energy scavenging;industrial sensors;micromachined thermoelectric generators;micropower thermoelectric generators;on-the-body sensors;power 2.1 muW;power energy-autonomous wireless sensor systems;rechargeable battery;thermal conditions;variable conversion factor","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Taiwan Univ., Taipei","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008. ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","466","628","The frequency divider (FD) is one of the key components in very-high-frequency (VHF) PLLs. Conventionally, injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) , Miller frequency divider, and CML static divider are widely used in various applications. Among these dividers, the ILFD has the highest operation frequency, but the locking range is limited. On the other hand, the static FD covers a wide locking range, but its operation frequency is low and the power consumption is usually high. Since a FD connected to a VCO operates at the highest frequency, the power dissipation and the locking range of a VHF FD should be carefully considered. In a PLL, due to the process and temperature variations, the locking range of the ILFD must be several times larger than the tuning range of the VCO. Thus, it is challenging to design a wide locking-range and low-power ILFD in the millimeter-wave applications. To achieve a higher operational frequency for an ILFD, the distributed LC oscillator is adopted. To widen the locking range of an ILFD, the transconductance-enhancement technique is presented. In this paper, two low-power ILFDs have a locking range of 85.1 to 96.3 GHz and 98.9 to 105.2 GHz, respectively.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523259","","CMOS technology;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Inductors;Parasitic capacitance;Power measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Spirals;Transconductance;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency dividers;phase locked loops","CMOS technology;ILFD;VHF;W-band frequency divider;frequency 85.1 GHz to 96.3 GHz;frequency 98.9 GHz to 105.2 GHz;injection-locked frequency divider;locking range;millimeter-wave applications;phase locked loops;power 3.5 mW;very-high-frequency PLL","","20","","8","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The white pixel, however, saturates at low light levels and sufficient dynamic range cannot be obtained as a result.

HomePlugAV is one such 200Mb/s powerline modem standard. However, for these devices to fully realize the market potential, the total application cost must be reduced and performance enhancements enabling increased network throughput must be made. Currently, HomePlug-AV products require 4 chips to implement the modem function: a processor, an external memory, an AFE, and an external line driver. With this in mind, this work describes an integrated sub-micron CMOS AFE meeting the HomePlug-AV standard, but with additional Gb/s capability.

Through technology scaling, CMOS CML static divider high-frequency performances have been scaled, and they are comparable to dividers in other technologies. In addition to the device performance, circuit design and measurement determine the divider high-speed and wide frequency range performance. One of the uncertainties in CML static divider measurement is pulling and locking hysteresis. By using CML static divider topology, the divider has been assumed to have a fixed wide operation range, from DC to the f<sub>div</sub> <sub>,</sub> <sub>max</sub>, the maximum input-referred divider operational frequency. In fact, the CML static dividers show a certain degree of locking hysteresis, similar to injection-locking dividers. When the circuit sensitivity curve is measured, it is not clear where to set the threshold. Depending on the method, a sensitivity curve can be optimistic or pessimistic. A similar problem lies in the f<sub>div</sub> <sub>,</sub> <sub>max</sub>, since it changes depending on the status of a divider.

These converters have to combine the stringent speed specifications with the demand for low power consumption. Flash architectures are often chosen because they offer the largest speed. However, in this architecture, area and power depend exponentially on the resolution since the comparators are often the largest contributor to the overall power consumption. Folding is a well-known technique used to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high speed. It was previously implemented by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers, often in combination with interpolation or averaging. In this design, a folding factor of 2 is realized as in but with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers.

Optical techniques, based on voltage- and calcium-sensitive dyes or photouncaging, along with multi-photon fluorescent microscopy have proven very successful in imaging activity in slices and in vivo. However, studies have been limited by the ability to stimulate different regions of tissue with enough spatial resolution and throughput. Traditional stimulation is accomplished with passive multielectrode arrays (MEAs) or bipolar electrodes. In both cases, a relatively small number of stimulation sites with coarse spatial resolution are possible. While there has been recent work on the development of CMOS chips for extracellular recordings of cultured neurons or slices on planar electrodes, the focus of this work is on stimulation and achieving stable electrical interfaces between acute slices and a high-density active CMOS MEA. As brain slices preserve many synaptic connections, they are ideal preparations to study neuronal microcircuits in vitro. Active stimulation technologies should enable detailed ""reverse engineering"" of neural circuitry.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523100","","Brain;Electrodes;Extracellular;Microelectrodes;Nervous system;Neurons;Optical microscopy;Spatial resolution;Stimulated emission;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;biological tissues;brain;microelectrodes;neuromuscular stimulation","CMOS microelectrode array;acute brain slices;biological tissue;calcium-sensitive dyes;cultured neurons;extracellular neural stimulation;extracellular recordings;microcircuits;multiphoton fluorescent microscopy;nervous system;optical techniques;passive multielectrode arrays;photouncaging;spatial resolution;synaptic connections","","0","","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a polar transmitter, high-efficiency non-linear power amplifiers can be used for linearly modulated waveforms. Because of envelope bandwidth expansion in polar modulated transmitters, the design of a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency supply modulator is one of the most challenging aspects of a polar transmitter. The most common technique for providing wide-bandwidth low-noise supply modulation in a linear system PA is by using linear low-dropout regulators, however at backed-off power levels their efficiencies are low. Envelope tracking is another common technique for transmitter design. Although this technique relaxes the bandwidth requirement of the supply modulator, it uses a less efficient linear power amplifier. A parallel combination of linear and switch-mode regulators for a polar PA is proposed. A similar topology for EDGE PA regulators has been proposed.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523250","","Degradation;Delay;Feedback loop;High power amplifiers;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Regulators;Transmitters;Voltage","HF amplifiers;code division multiple access;low noise amplifiers;modulation;power amplifiers;radio transmitters","CDMA transmitter;PA-supply regulator;frequency 10 MHz;high-linearity power amplifier system;polar modulation","","16","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
