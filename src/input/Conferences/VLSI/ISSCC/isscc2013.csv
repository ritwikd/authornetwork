This is mainly driven by the increase in cutoff frequency and decrease in power consumption brought by lower supply voltages. However, at mm-Wave, challenges such as low Q-factor of the tuning varactors and switched capacitors result in a sharp degradation in the resonator Q. For an NMOS LC-VCO (Fig. 8.8.1), a large bias current and high transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>) are needed to maintain a given oscillation amplitude and to satisfy the startup condition. Since g<sub>m</sub> has a weak dependency on current in strong inversion, it can primarily be increased by enlarging the device width, W<sub>1</sub>, as illustrated in Fig. 8.8.2. Further degradation in the device g<sub>m</sub> is experienced when the VCO operates near the transistor cutoff frequency, necessitating an even larger W<sub>1</sub> (Fig. 8.8.2). This results in a large fixed capacitance C<sub>fix1</sub> and hence a limited VCO tuning range (TR) [1,2]. It can also be shown that for the same bias current (i.e. output swing), increasing W1 comes at the expense of large thermal (1/f<sup>2</sup>) noise. This can be illustrated by examining the excess noise factor F, defined as the ratio between the transistors' switching noise and the tank resistor noise [6]. As depicted in Fig. 8.8.2, an extra 5dB of 1/f<sup>2</sup> noise is added to the VCO output when the transistor W1 is increased from 20μm to 60μm, which is required to meet a 2× startup margin. Moreover, increasing W<sub>1</sub> leads to a higher contribution of 1/f<sup>3</sup> noise from up-converted 1/f noise [7].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487677","","BiCMOS integrated circuits;CMOS integrated circuits;MOS devices;Noise;Transistors;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","1/f noise;BiCMOS integrated circuits;bipolar MIMIC;current distribution;millimetre wave oscillators;thermal noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","NMOS LC-VCO;average FOM;current-redistribution BiCMOS VCO;digital CMOS technology;excess noise factor;figures of merit;frequency 37.8 GHz;high transconductance;large bias current;low Q-factor;mm-wave VCO;oscillation amplitude;power 10 mW;power consumption;switched capacitors;tank resistor noise;thermal noise;transistor cutoff frequency;transistor switching noise;tuning varactors;up-converted 1/f noise","","1","","8","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Self-contained, linear CMOS PAs are particularly attractive for smooth replacement of conventional compound semiconductor PA products. The main challenge concerning the linear CMOS PAs is to improve their power efficiency. Doherty PAs improve the average power efficiency by means of backoff efficiency boosting; however, their applicable carrier frequency range is narrow owing to the high-order output network. Supply modulation is another technique to improve the PA back-off efficiency. Although hybrid modulators have been studied for CMOS polar transmitters [1,2], none of them have satisfied full specs of modulation bandwidth and the output power for 4G cellular applications. The area overhead is also unacceptable for application to a self-contained linear PA. A class-G supply modulator relaxes the limitations by receiving external, discrete levels of supply voltages [3]. However, it still requires a costly extra DC-DC converter for multilevel supply voltages.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487650","","CMOS integrated circuits;Modulation;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Radio frequency;Spread spectrum communication","4G mobile communication;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Long Term Evolution;UHF integrated circuits;UHF power amplifiers;code division multiple access;modulators","4G cellular applications;CMOS polar transmitters;DC-DC converter;Doherty PA;WCDMA-LTE applications;area overhead;backoff efficiency boosting;class-G supply modulator;compound semiconductor PA products;frequency 1.8 GHz;high-order output network;hybrid modulators;linear CMOS power amplifier;low-cost CMOS PA;power efficiency;self-contained linear PA;supply-path switching scheme","","9","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, next generations of DVB standards (e.g. DVB-T2 and DVB-C2) are proposed, which adopt 256 QAM and even 4k QAM modulation to obtain higher performance. Often the DTV tuners employ a direct-conversion Zero-IF architecture, which demands the use of a wideband fractional-N synthesizer as the local oscillator (LO) to cover the frequency range of 50 to 900MHz. This LO needs to meet a very stringent phase noise requirement with an adequate target phase noise of -98dBc/Hz at a 10kHz offset and integrated rms phase error less than 0.25° [1]. However, it is well known that the performance of fractional-N PLLs is significantly influenced by the circuit nonlinearity. Nonlinearity results in the noise-folding phenomenon, which can seriously degrade the in-band phase noise and raise reference and fractional spurs [2].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487769","","Digital TV;Frequency conversion;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Synthesizers;Wideband","digital video broadcasting;frequency synthesizers;inductors;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","256 QAM;4k QAM modulation;ATSC-C/M/H;China;DMB-T;DVB standards;DVB-C2;DVB-T/C/H;DVB-T2;Europe;ISDB-T;Japan;North America;South Korea;TDMB;circuit nonlinearity;digital TV standards;direct-conversion zero-IF architecture;fractional-N PLL;frequency 50 MHz to 930 MHz;frequency 770 MHz to 1860 MHz;in-band phase noise;integrated rms phase error;local oscillator;multistandard DTV tuners;noise folding effect;noise-folding phenomenon;phase noise requirement;quadrature-output fractional-N frequency synthesizer;single-inductor LC-VCO;target phase noise;wideband fractional-N synthesizer","","0","","4","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the simultaneous operation of the RX and TX, large TX leakage is the main issue in securing RX sensitivity. Although external isolation components such as a circulator or directional coupler are widely used in RFID systems, TX leakage is still a dominant source of sensitivity degradation due to its finite isolation and environmentally dependent antenna reflection ratio, as shown in Fig. 5.6.1(a). In a single-antenna-based RFID system, the TX carrier leakage is typically above 0dBm at the RX input despite off-chip isolation components [1]. As can be seen in Fig. 5.6.1(b), when the close-in phase noise of the TX carrier is -85dBc/Hz, the phase noise level of 0dBm TX leakage in the receive channel reaches 89dB higher than the thermal noise level, thus directly degrading the SNR. In efforts to solve the leakage problem, leakage cancellation [2,3] and self-correlated RX [4] techniques have been reported. However, high power consumption for leakage replica generation and long calibration time, as in [2,3], and hardware complexity for a 45 degree phase shift [4] are issues that need to be resolved.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487651","","Detectors;Mixers;Radiofrequency identification;Receivers;Sensitivity;Signal to noise ratio;Transistors","antennas;phase noise;radio receivers;radiofrequency amplifiers;radiofrequency identification;thermal noise","RFID receiver;RX sensitivity security;TX carrier leakage;TX leakage-suppression technique;backscattering communication;circulator;close-in phase noise;dead-zone amplifier;directional coupler;environmentally dependent antenna reflection ratio;leakage cancellation;leakage replica generation;off-chip isolation components;power consumption;self-correlated RX techniques;single-antenna-based RFID system;thermal noise level","","1","","4","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technology may rely on piezoelectric or electrostatic energy conversion using the energy available during the tire impact with the road. The power management system has to transfer harvested power to the load battery (few μW to mW) with the highest possible efficiency. An electrostatic harvester can generate voltages up to 40V even at low accelerations [1]. Hence, a high voltage (HV) DC-DC converter is needed to maximize the energy transfer from the harvester to the load battery. However, HV buck converters including maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms have been shown only for much higher ranges of power, in the order of W [2]. On the other hand, all reported converters working in the sub-mW power range are not able to sustain high input voltages and do not include an integrated MPPT algorithm [3, 4]. Until this work, no solution in literature is able to interface with these electrostatic energy harvesters. Figure 4.6.1 shows the block diagram of the system, designed and fabricated in TSMC 0.25μm BCD CMOS (60V option). The IC is able to interface a vibrational harvester by means of few external components: a rectifier, its load capacitor C<sub>IN</sub>, and an inductor L. The converter is consisting of a power train and its control circuits. The power train is implemented with the external inductor L, and the integrated power switches M<sub>P</sub> and M<sub>N</sub>.

Hybrid/heterogeneous designs [1-3] enable each component to be custom-tailored, but suffer from large packaging parasitics, increased manufacturing costs due to requisite process flows, and costly 3D integration or microbump packaging. Monolithic integration mitigates integration overheads, but has not penetrated deeply-scaled technologies due to necessary process customizations [4].

Equalizers are used to cancel the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency-dependent channel losses such as skin effect and dielectric loss. The primary objective of an equalizer is to compensate for high-frequency loss, which often exceeds 30dB at f<sub>s</sub>/2. However, due to the skin effect in a PCB stripline, which starts at 10MHz or lower, we also need to compensate for a small amount of loss at low frequency (e.g., 500MHz). Figure 2.1.1 shows simulated responses of a backplane channel (42.6dB loss at f<sub>s</sub>/2 for 32Gb/s) with conventional high-frequency equalizers only (4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), 1<sup>st</sup>-order continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with a dominant pole at f<sub>s</sub>/4, and 1-tap DFE) and with additional low-frequency equalization. Conventional equalizers cannot compensate for the small amount of low-frequency loss because the slope of the low-frequency loss is too gentle (<;3dB/dec). The FFE and CTLE do not have a pole in the low frequency region and hence have only a steep slope of 20dB/dec above their zero. The DFE cancels only short-term ISI. Effects of such low-frequency loss have often been overlooked or neglected, because 1) the loss is small (2 to 3dB), 2) when plotted using the linear frequency axis which is commonly used to show frequency dependence of skin effect and dielectric loss, the low-frequency loss is degenerated at DC and hardly visible (Fig. 2.1.1a), and 3) the long ISI tail of the channel pulse response seems well cancelled at first glance by conventional equalizers only (Fig. 2.1.1b). However, the uncompensated low-frequency loss causes non-negligible long-term residual ISI, because the integral of the residual ISI magnitude keeps going up for several hundred UI. As shown by the eye diagrams in the inset of Fig. 2.1.1(b), the residual long-term ISI resul- s in 0.42UI data-dependent Jitter (DDJ) that is difficult to reduce further by enhancing FFE/CTLE/DFE, but can be reduced to 0.21UI by adding a low-frequency equalizer (LFEQ).

Compared to conventional 2D imaging systems, 3D imaging can provide a detailed view of tissue structures that makes diagnosis easier for the physicians. In addition, 2D image slices can be formed at various orientations to the transducer, making the examination less dependent on the skill of the sonographer. However, various challenges exist in developing a 3D imaging system, such as integration of a large number of elements, as well as post-processing of datasets received from a large number of channels. 2D transducer arrays are typically integrated with custom ICs in the probe handle to perform some intermediate beamforming and to reduce the number of cable connections to the imaging system. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative to piezoelectric transducers. Being a MEMS device, they greatly benefit from flexibility and ease of fabrication, and can be seamlessly integrated with electronics. Previous work demonstrates 3D stacking of CMUTs and dummy ICs with an intermediate interposer layer. However, that represents more of a mechanical demonstration of 3D integration.

By processing thin-film transistors (TFTs) at low temperatures on plastic (using organics, amorphous silicon, metal oxides, etc.), blocks such as ADCs, amplifiers, and processors can be realized [1,2]; however, aside from short-range RFID tags [3], wireless links for long-range communication have not been achieved. A key challenge is that wireless systems typically depend on the ability to generate and operate at high frequencies, yet TFTs are limited to very low performance (f<sub>t</sub> ~1MHz). Specifically, the challenge is low device g<sub>m</sub>, due to low mobility and limited gate-dielectric scalability, as well as high device capacitance, due to limited feature scalability and large overlaps for alignment margining on flexible substrates. This work presents a super-regenerative (SR) transceiver with integrated antenna on plastic that leverages the attribute of large area to create highquality passives; this enables resonant TFT circuits at high frequencies (near f<sub>t</sub>) and allows for large antennas, maximizing the communication distance. The resulting carrier frequency is 900kHz, and the range is over 12m (at 2kb/s). As shown in Fig. 25.10.1, this will enable sheets with integrated arrays of radio frontends for distributing a large number of communication links over large areas.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487814","","Antennas;Capacitance;Envelope detectors;Inductors;Oscillators;Plastics;Thin film transistors","antenna arrays;radio links;radio networks;radio transceivers;thin film transistors","ADC;TFT;amorphous silicon;amplifiers;antenna;bit rate 2 kbit/s;distributed communication links;frequency 1 MHz;frequency 900 kHz;integrated antenna;integrated radio frontend arrays;large flexible sheets;large-area electronics;limited gate-dielectric scalability;metal oxides;organics;processors;resulting carrier frequency;super-regenerative radio;super-regenerative transceiver;thin-film transistors;ubiquitous systems;wireless systems","","1","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The requirements are extremely low power consumption, high data bandwidth, stability and scalability of operation, as well as large storage capacity with a small footprint. A digital control chip at the base of the stack is needed to efficiently access the 3D memory hierarchy, as well as to emulate a standard memory interface for compatibility. The overall performance and yields of a 3D system are constrained by vertical communication channels among the stacked chips, as well as the connections to the PCB. However, the empirical models presently used in the design stage do not properly represent the electrical and mechanical properties and performance variations of through silicon vias (TSVs) and microbumps (μBumps). What is needed are circuit techniques that handle such uncertainties to enable the creation of robust 3D data links. This paper presents a complete test vehicle for TSV-based wide I/O data communication in a three-tier 3D chip stack assembled in a BGA package.

The first steps towards flexible organic electronics were code generators for RFID tags [1]. To realize flexible smart sensors it is also essential to develop analog sensor interfaces and ADCs, which will enable the integration of sensors, data processing and RF communication (Fig. 6.6.1) on the same plastic foil [2]. This paper focuses on the design of an organic ADC for quasi-static signals, like the ones provided by chemical and temperature sensors. Only a few ADCs made with organic TFTs (OTFTs) have been reported [3,4] so far. Their linearity is limited by the poor matching typical of organic technologies and reached an INL of 2.6LSB at 6b resolution before calibration. This paper addresses an ADC whose linearity is not related to the matching of OTFTs or capacitances, but relies on the electrical properties of a transconductor. Even without calibration, the INL is 1LSB and the DNL is 0.6LSB at 6b resolution. The converter is manufactured in a double-gate p-type OTFT technology [5], which provides two gates to control the semiconductor channel, G and TG (Fig. 6.6.1): a voltage applied to the top gate TG produces a linearly proportional shift of the threshold voltage.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487658","","Frequency measurement;Linearity;Logic gates;Organic thin film transistors;Radiation detectors;Voltage-controlled oscillators","analogue-digital conversion;flexible electronics;organic field effect transistors;thin film transistors;voltage-controlled oscillators","RF communication;RFID protocols;analog sensor interfaces;chemical sensors;code generators;data processing;double-gate p-type OTFT technology;electrical properties;flexible organic electronics;large-area organic electronics;organic VCO-based ADC;organic electronics applications;packaging films;plastic foil;quasistatic signals;semiconductor channel;smart sensors;temperature sensors;transconductor;word length 6 bit","","3","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To date, it has been difficult to achieve high resolution with pipelined ADCs operating at low voltages due to gain and nonlinearity constraints. Digital means of calibration have been suggested to correct opamp nonlinearity, relying on weakly nonlinear transfer functions with coefficients that may need a long time to measure accurately. Alternative types of ADCs that use no opamps, such as successive-approximation, time-domain, and comparator-based designs, have been gaining in popularity. In this paper we implement an inherently exact residue pipelining scheme that is not impaired by opamp gain and nonlinearity. Unlike other calibration methods that sort out errors after they occur, the proposed circuit performs no post analog or digital signal processing, as gain and nonlinearity errors are eliminated entirely at their very sources.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487736","","Bandwidth;Calibration;Capacitance;Noise;Solid state circuits;Switched capacitor circuits;Transfer functions","analogue-digital conversion;calibration;comparators (circuits);delta-sigma modulation;integrated circuit design;operational amplifiers;pipeline processing;switched capacitor networks;time-domain analysis;transfer functions","ΔΣ modulator;adaptive cancellation;analog design;comparator-based design;digital calibration;gain constraint;gain error;nonlinear transfer function;nonlinearity constraint;nonlinearity error;opamp gain;opamp nonlinearity;pipelined ADC;residue pipelining scheme;successive-approximation design;switched-capacitor circuit;time-domain design;voltage transfer","","4","","3","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To extend battery usage time before recharge, harvesting energy from ambient light provides an elegant solution if the photovoltaic (PV) modules can be integrated with mobile devices [1]. However, mobile devices are frequently finger operated and/or in motion, so light-harvesting should consider fast-changing shading and partial shading problems. Previous IC works [2-4] have reported on the implementation of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for light-harvesting, none of them have concurrently addressed these two problems. Although one of these works [3] considered the mobile device issue, it targets high MPPT steady-state accuracy without considering fast-changing shading problem.

A photovoltaic (PV) energy-harvesting charger can convert energy from solar panels to charge batteries or super capacitors. To manage the variation in illumination, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is essential to lock the output power of solar panels on the maximum power points [1, 2]. For any generic solar cell, its output current is determined by the output voltage in an exponential relation. Without knowing the characteristics of the solar cell in advance, it is necessary to monitor a feedback parameter to reach its maximum power point. Current measurement is needed at the output of the boost converter [1] or in the output path of the solar cell [2]. Motivated by the topology in [2], we propose a mixed-signal integration to avoid power hungry digital signal processing. In this paper, we report a charger with an integrated MPPT controller that can provide fast tracking for wide-range illumination levels while keeping high conversion efficiency.

However, due to limitation in the reliability of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the required endurance may not be achieved if the MTJ is overstressed by the write voltage. In this paper, a new write-path design with wire-resistance-balance scheme is presented that minimizes the voltage stress on MTJ during write operation for cells near the write buffer. Simulation shows the voltage across MTJ becomes more uniform for cells from top to bottom of array.

Among the diversity of techniques available for range detection, Time-of-Flight (ToF) offers advantages in terms of compact system realization, good performance, and low required computational power. The last works on ToF sensors, presenting demodulation sensors based on photon-mixing devices [1, 2], and time-counting sensors based on single-photon avalanche diodes [3], have shown a trend towards higher resolutions, with a consequent reduction of pixel size, higher modulation frequencies, and demodulation contrast to allow better distance precision. In this paper, we introduce a range camera concept that exploits linear-mode avalanche photodiodes (APD) as in-pixel demodulating detectors [4]. Thanks to photocurrent gain modulation, APDs can combine optical sensing and light-signal demodulation in a single device. The main advantage of the APD implementation is the possibility to operate at high frequencies, due to its very wide bandwidth.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487828","","Cameras;Demodulation;Frequency modulation;Noise;Sensors;Three-dimensional displays","avalanche photodiodes;demodulation;mixing;sensors","3D camera;ToF sensor;compact system realization;demodulation sensor;gaming;in-pixel demodulating detector;light-signal demodulation;linear-mode avalanche photodiode;linear-mode gain-modulated avalanche photodiode;mobile application;optical sensing;photocurrent gain modulation;photon-mixing device;range camera;range detection;range imaging;robotics;security;single-photon avalanche diode;surveillance;time-counting sensor;time-of-flight;vehicle safety","","7","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new, small-size and high-speed non-contact interconnect between printed circuit boards (PCBs) using a vertical directional coupler (VDC), which has actually been applied to a liquid crystal display (LCD) driver board. The feasibility of a millimeter-range non-contact interface using a directional coupler was studied previously [1]. In this paper, two signal ports have been implemented in one coupler by best utilizing the characteristics of VDC. The coupler size is 5mm × 2.25mm, and the gap between the couplers is about 75μm, which corresponds to the twofold thickness of a soldering resist on PCB and the adhesive material in between. The transmitter transforms the data sequence from Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) into pulses in order to reduce the level of DC components. This achieves a power saving of 1.47pJ/b, and the pulses are sent to the coupler in differential mode to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI). The measured speed was 4.6Gb/s per coupler to achieve the MIPI's maximum speed of 6Gb/s with two couplers. Conventional connectors have housings to protect contact elements or to provide mechanical support for plug-in and out. However, these housings make it difficult to achieve the smallest possible systems because they require extra space. In addition, they sometimes make the PCB trace longer, which deteriorates the maximum data rate. The method we have developed involves delineating VDC on PCB or a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to connect boards without housings and with the minimum distance. As a result, this interconnect scheme is advantageous not only because it saves space but also because it makes it easier to build systems, even those that contain a large number of built-in connectors. Thus, the proposed non-contact interconnect is suitable for future small-si- e systems.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487699","","Directional couplers;Electromagnetic interference;Optical signal processing;Receivers;Transmission line measurements;Transmitters","directional couplers;electric connectors;electromagnetic interference;printed circuit interconnections;soldering","DC components;EMI;FPC;LCD driver board;PCB;VDC;VDC characteristics;adhesive material;data sequence;electromagnetic interference;flexible printed circuit;high-speed noncontact interconnect scheme;liquid crystal display;millimeter-range noncontact interface;nonreturn-to-zero;printed circuit boards;silicon chip performance;size 0.15 mm;soldering resist thickness;transmitter;vertical directional coupler","","1","","2","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For Time Division Duplexing (TDD), such as GSM, the SAW can be removed if the receiver can handle very large interferers (e.g. in GSM 0dBm 20 MHz away) [1]. Generally SAW filters also perform differential to single-ended (SE) conversion (balun). Once the SAW is removed an SE transceiver eliminates the external balun, reducing cost and attenuation. For the same sensitivity, a SAW-less SE transceiver can have a noise figure (NF) 2 to 3dB higher than a classical one. An SE LNA could be susceptable to couplings from supply and substrate, which are usually rejected through symmetry. Therefore it should become symmetric as closely as possible to the input pin. A SAW-less differential transceiver [2] can also be appealing if it has an NF close to that of classical transceivers. This is because it can have better sensitivity in TDD (a balun attenuates less than a SAW) and it can be very flexible, being usable for both FDD (where duplexers are differential) and TDD.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487646","","GSM;Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Noise;Noise measurement;Power harmonic filters;Receivers","frequency division multiplexing;low noise amplifiers;radio transceivers;time division multiplexing","FDD;GSM;LNA;SAW-less SE transceiver;SAW-less analog front-end receivers;SAW-less differential transceiver;SE balun;TDD;cellular receivers;differential-to-single-ended conversion;frequency division duplexing;low-noise amplifier;noise figure;noise figure 2 dB to 3 dB;out-of-band blockers;surface-acoustic-wave filters;time division duplexing","","8","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a significant drawback of such amplifiers is a transfer-function notch around the chopping frequency (f<sub>chop</sub>). This is because their input choppers demodulate signals near f<sub>chop</sub> to DC, where they are blocked by the input capacitors. This problem is exacerbated by the use of a ripple-reduction loop (RRL) to suppress chopper ripple, which also creates a notch at f<sub>chop</sub>, and, moreover, can take up to 1ms to settle. The net result is an amplifier with a transfer-function notch and a step response that is accompanied by a slowly-decaying burst of chopper ripple [1]. To solve these problems, a multi-path capacitively-coupled chopper-stabilized operational amplifier (MCCOPA) is proposed. Implemented in a HV CMOS 0.7μm technology, it has a smooth transfer function and achieves a 20V common-mode voltage range (CMVR), 3μV offset and 148dB DC CMRR while drawing only 8μA from a 5V supply.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487688","","1f noise;Capacitors;Choppers (circuits);Operational amplifiers;Solid state circuits;Transfer functions","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;choppers (circuits);operational amplifiers;transfer functions","HV CMOS technology;MCCOPA;RRL;chopper ripple suppression;chopping frequency;common-mode voltage range;input capacitors;multipath chopper-stabilized capacitively coupled operational amplifier;ripple-reduction loop;size 0.7 mum;transfer-function notch;voltage 20 V;voltage 3 muV;voltage 5 V","","1","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the modulated signals causes a degradation in PA efficiency, since the supply voltage of the PA must be high enough to provide the peak output voltage without loss of linearity. Envelope tracking modulators have been proposed to improve the efficiency and linearity of transmitters. Modulators using multiple input voltages have been shown to improve efficiency, but generating multiple supplies imposes substantial overhead. Several recent works have demonstrated a hybrid modulator, combining the output current of a buck output stage with that of a linear amplifier. The hybrid modulator has the notable advantage that the low-frequency power (which constitutes the majority of power, even in high-PAPR scenarios) can be provided through the efficient buck stage. The inherently less efficient linear amplifier stage needs only to supply the high-frequency power. The efficiency of hybrid modulators degrades at moderate power levels, when the ac amplitude is much less than the supply voltage of the linear amplifier. At low power levels, the power savings afforded by the modulator do not offset its own quiescent current, resulting in a lower efficiency than can be achieved using a fixed-drain, average-power-tracking (FD-APT) supply.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487771","","Batteries;Modulation;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Regulators;Switches;Voltage control","Long Term Evolution;modulators;radio transmitters","AC-coupled hybrid envelope modulator;FD-APT supply;HSUPA transmitters;LTE;PAPR;average-power-tracking supply;buck stage;efficiency 80 percent;envelope tracking modulators;fixed-drain supply;high-data-rate wireless technology;hybrid modulator;linear amplifier;modulated signals;peak-to-average power ratio;substantial overhead;supply voltage","","1","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works [1,2] sampled the incoming data at 2 samples per UI and at 1.45 samples per UI to achieve 5Gb/s and 6.875Gb/s, respectively. To further increase the data rate to 10Gb/s, we sample at baud rate (1 sample per UI). Existing baud-rate architectures [3] rely on a phase-tracking clock to sample at the middle of the data eye. This paper presents a blind baud-rate CDR, fabricated in 65nm CMOS. At 10Gb/s, the CDR demonstrates a high-frequency jitter tolerance of 0.19UI with ±300ppm of frequency offset.

For cochlear implants [1] and retinal prostheses [2], having a miniaturized form factor and being battery-less are highly desirable. Such devices require real-time power transfer in the range of 10 to 100mW [3], and as human tissue specific absorption rate (SAR) increases with frequency, inductively-coupled power links that operate at 13.56MHz or lower in ISM bands are commonly used, as shown in Fig. 4.2.1. However, lower transmission frequency means larger matching and filtering capacitors that are bulky. In addition, the received AC input amplitude V<sub>AC,Peak</sub> would fluctuate due to changes in distance and orientation between the coupling coils. Hence, comparator- controlled power switches (active diodes) are used to replace diodes so that the rectifier could work at a lower V<sub>AC,Peak</sub> and still achieve a high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) [4]. In this research, we present the first fully integrated 1X/2X active rectifier in the 30mW range with all capacitors fabricated on-chip, also shown in Fig. 4.2.1. This is made possible by a switching arrangement that avoids connecting the output capacitors in series in the 2X mode. Reverse current is reduced for V<sub>AC,Peak</sub> that ranges from 1.25 to 4V by a bias current that is quasi-inversely proportional to the output DC voltage, as explained later; and efficiency is carefully measured by the insertion of a sensing resistor plus an additional capacitor to reduce distortion.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487639","","Biomedical measurement;Capacitors;Current measurement;Rectifiers;System-on-chip;Video recording;Voltage measurement","capacitors;comparators (circuits);inductive power transmission;power semiconductor switches;rectifiers","ISM bands;PCE;SAR;VCR;biomedical implants;capacitor fabricated on-chip;cochlear implants;comparator-controlled power switches;compensated bias current;coupling coils;filtering capacitors;frequency 13.56 MHz;fully integrated 1X-2X active rectifier;high voltage conversion ratio;human tissue specific absorption rate;inductively powered devices;inductively-coupled power links;mobile phone chargers;power 10 mW to 100 mW;power conversion efficiency;received AC input amplitude;retinal prostheses;sensing resistor;voltage 1.25 V to 4 V;wireless power transfer","","5","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, capacitive touch-screen technology still suffers from performance degradation like a low frame scan rate and poor accuracy, etc. One of the key performance factors is the immunity to external noise, which intrudes randomly into the touch-screen system. HUM, display noise, and SMPS are such noise sources. The main electrical power source produces HUM, one of the most important sources of noise, which has a 50 or 60Hz component. Display noise is emitted when an LCD or OLED is driven by the internal timing controller, which generates the driving signal in the tens of kHz range. The touch performance of On-Cell or In-Cell touch displays is seriously affected by this kind of noise, because the distance between the display pixel layer and the capacitive touchscreen panel is getting smaller. SMPS is another noise source that ranges up to 300kHz. The charger for a smart-phone, the USB port in a computer, a tri-phosphor fluorescent light bulb are all examples of sources of SMPS. There have been many attempts to remove such noise. Amplitude modulation with frequency hopping is proposed in [1]. However, when the noise environment changes, this method needs recalibration, resulting in non-constant touch response time. Another method tries to filter the noise from the display [2], but it does not remove other noise sources like HUM or SMPS.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487782","","Electrodes;Noise measurement;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Switched-mode power supply;Timing","amplitude modulation;frequency hop communication;smart phones;touch sensitive screens","SMPS;SNR;USB port;amplitude modulation;capacitive touch screen panel;capacitive touch screen technology;capacitor;code division multiple sensing;display noise;display pixel layer;electrical power source;frame scan rate;frequency 50 Hz;frequency 60 Hz;frequency hopping;internal timing controller;multitouch;noise source;nonconstant touch response time;recalibration;smart phone market;touch displays;touch screen panel read out IC;touch screen system;triphosphor fluorescent light bulb;user interfaces","","6","","3","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An SRAM using output prediction to reduce BL-switching activity and statistically-gated SA for up to 1.9× reduction in energy/access","Sinangil, M.E.; Chandrakasan, A.P.","Nvidia, Bedford, MA, USA","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2013 IEEE International","20130328","2013","","","318","319","Mobile applications such as tablets pack increasingly more processing capability comparable to workstations or laptops but can do little for cooling or extending the battery life in their form factors. SRAMs account for a large fraction of chip area and are critical in this context. Recent work has focused on voltage scaling in SRAMs, which is an effective way of achieving energy efficiency [1,2]. These conventional SRAMs are mostly general-purpose in the sense that they are designed without considering the specific features of the data they will store. However, application-specific features such as statistics of storage data can be exploited and incorporated into the transistor-level design to provide a new dimension towards achieving the next level of energy savings in addition to the savings provided through voltage scaling. The work in [3] is an example where an inversion bit is added for each word to reduce read-bitline (RBL) transitions in an 8T-cell-based design with a single-ended read port. Similarly, the work in [4] stores only the LSBs of each word in 6T SRAMs where occasional bit-errors at low voltages are tolerable for its application. In this work, we focus on video; however, the ideas can be generalized to different applications. In video encoders, pixel processing is performed over large partitions of image frames (e.g., 192×192 pixels), which are stored in on-chip SRAMs and accessed frequently. Image frames generally consist of smooth backgrounds or large objects where the intensity of pixels is spatially correlated. For the video image frame in Fig. 18.2.1, the deviation of each pixel's intensity from its block average for a 16×16 block shows that 76% of pixels lie within 3 LSB of the average. This additional information can be used to design an SRAM where correlation of data is used to reduce bitline activity factor which, for an 8T SRAM in a 65nm low-power CMOS process, accounts for ~50% of total energy consumption during read a- cesses at 0.6V. In this work, we present a prediction-based reduced-bitline-switching-activity (PB-RBSA) scheme along with a hierarchical sensing network with statistical sense-amplifier gating to exploit the correlation of storage data. Reduction of switching activity on the bitlines and in the sensing network of the memory provide up to 1.9× reduction in energy/access.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487751","","CMOS process;Energy measurement;Logic gates;Random access memory;Sensors;Streaming media;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;SRAM chips;error statistics;low-power electronics;power aware computing;storage management;video coding","8T-cell-based design;LSB;RBL transitions;application-specific features;battery life;chip area;cooling;energy efficiency;energy savings;image frames;inversion bit;laptops;mobile applications;occasional bit-errors;output prediction;pixel processing;processing capability;read-bitline trtansitions;reduce BL-switching activity;reduction;single-ended read port;statistically-gated SA;storage data statistics;tablets;transistor-level design;video encoders;voltage 0.6 V;voltage scaling;workstations","","2","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All-digital or fully synthesizable approaches, which exploit the merits of advanced processes, suffer from poor noise performance and high power consumption [2]. On the other hand, hybrid approaches, which employ analog components such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs), digital-to-time converters, phase interpolators (PIs) and regulators, have the typical difficulties associated with analog circuits, such as low output resistance, small voltage headroom and large variation. In this paper, we propose a highly digital architecture for a DPLL - one which minimizes the design effort typically required for analog circuits. The power and area-consuming circuits in prior works are replaced by power and area-efficient circuits with competitive performance. For example, a conventional time-to-digital converter (TDC) usually occupies considerable chip area in order to maximize input dynamic range with precise resolution [1]. Instead, in this work, a time-windowed phase-to-digital converter using interpolated DCO phases as a phase reference is adopted. In addition, conventional synchronous counters in the feedback path drastically increase the power consumption. Furthermore, retiming of data from the TDC is unavoidable due to the meta-stability of the sampling flip-flops [1]. The proposed divider scheme, which is composed of a multi-modulus frequency divider and a dead-zone-free phase and frequency detector (PFD), eliminates the need for a synchronous counter and retiming circuits. A calibration-free ΔΣ modulator (DSM) noise canceller is also included.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487723","","Analog circuits;Feeds;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Solid state circuits","delta-sigma modulation;digital phase locked loops;flip-flops;frequency dividers;interference suppression;phase detectors","DAC;DPLL;PFD;TDC;all-digital approach;analog circuits;analog components;calibration-free ΔΣ modulator noise canceller;calibration-free DSM noise canceller;dead-zone-free phase-frequency detector;digital PLL;digital fractional-N phase locked-loop;digital-to-analog converters;digital-to-time converters;frequency 32 MHz to 2000 MHz;interpolated DCO phases;multimodulus frequency divider;phase interpolators;phase-interpolating phase-to-digital converter;power 5.3 mW;power-area-consuming circuits;power-area-efficient circuits;regulators;sampling flip-flop meta-stability;semiconductor processes;synchronous counters;time-to-digital converter;time-windowed phase-to-digital converter","","2","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A soft self-commutating method using minimum control circuitry for multiple-string LED drivers","Junsik Kim; Jiyong Lee; Shihong Park","Dankook Univ., Yongin, South Korea","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2013 IEEE International","20130328","2013","","","376","377","Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in general lightings due to their several advantages including high efficiency, high reliability, long life, and environmental friendliness. Recently, various converter-free methods for non-isolated LED drivers with multiple LED strings connected in series have been introduced, enabling both a higher efficiency and power factor (PF) as well as lower total harmonic distortion (THD) [1-3]. In multiple-string LED drivers, the efficiency and PF are enhanced as the number of LED strings increases because of a low overhead voltage. However, as the operational voltage range decreases, it is difficult to find a proper commutation time using input voltage sensing approaches due to input voltage noise and LED voltage variation [4]. Other concerns are EMI and EMC noise caused by high di/dt and dv/dt in hard commutations. When the LED current is high, negative effects of hard commutation become worse and the required di/dt control circuits are more complicated [5]. To meet EMI and EMC regulations for lightings without adding on-board EMI filters, soft commutation is essential. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a soft self-commutating method using a Source-Coupled Pair (SCP) and reference voltages. The conventional control circuits required for an appropriate commutation time and soft commutation are no longer necessary. The fabricated 6-string LED driver IC is capable of achieving high efficiency (92.2%), high PF (0.996) and low THD (8.6%) under the 22W/110V AC condition.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487777","","Conferences;Current measurement;Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic interference;Integrated circuits;Light emitting diodes;Logic gates","driver circuits;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference;light emitting diodes;reference circuits;semiconductor device reliability","EMC noise;EMI noise;SCP;converter-free methods;di/dt control circuits;hard commutation;light-emitting diodes;minimum control circuitry;multiple LED strings;multiple-string LED drivers;nonisolated LED drivers;power 22 W;reference voltages;reliability;soft self-commutating method;source-coupled pair;total harmonic distortion;voltage 110 V;voltage noise","","0","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, the frequency-shift sensor of [1] demonstrates a high-sensitivity example of a cost-effective magnetic particle biosensor in CMOS with no need for external magnets. Despite their cost and sensitivity advantages, magnetic biosensors reported so far suffer from a lack of multi-probe diagnostics similar to fluorescent-based approaches that use multiple colors for simultaneous single-site multiple target differentiation. This is primarily because current approaches measure changes in the magnetic susceptibility, χ, either at low frequencies [2,3] or at a fixed RF frequency [1].

In recent times the statistical distribution of the TX power has shifted upward due to the use of data-intensive communications and the introduction of multi-gain power amplifiers. Therefore to extend battery life in fourth generation terminals, TX consumption at high power (>-10dBm) should be reduced.

In particular, portable devices such as smart phone and tablet require over 1Gb/s data transfer through ~1mm distance between AP board and a high resolution wide screen display board. Most of display interfaces are implemented with wire-line F-PCB connector, but, they suffer from: 1) high manufacturing cost, 2) the large form factor of the connector and standard socket and 3) large capacitance values of the connector and socket degrading the channel characteristics. So far, various communication interfaces have been tried to realize low cost, small form factor and low energy operation, but with limited success. The bi-phase pule modulation was used in board-to-board communication rather than base-band transmission due to its low energy operation [1-5]. This method used the positive pulse current for data `1' and the negative pulse current for data `0', and the receiver recovered the data by sampling the data at the exact time, which requires an accurate delay control unit. However, the bi-phase pulse modulation consumes significant power because: 1) current pulses sampled at every data consume large current in TX, and 2) a power hungry delay control unit is required to exactly control the sampling time.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487700","","Bit error rate;Clocks;Delays;Energy consumption;Receivers;Transceivers;Wireless communication","electric connectors;phase modulation;printed circuit interconnections;pulse modulation;radio transceivers","AP board;baseband transmission;biphase pulse modulation;bit rate 1.2 Gbit/s;channel characteristics;communication interfaces;display interfaces;high resolution wide screen display board;mm-range board-to-board communication;monophase pulse-modulation inductive-coupling transceiver;portable systems;power hungry delay control unit;short distance board-to-board interconnections;standard socket;wearable devices;wire-line F-PCB connector","","1","","9","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although cloud computing has recently drawn attention, data transfer consumes significant power (e.g., 1% battery charge of a smartphone when 10 pictures are transferred through WLAN), making local memory card storage still attractive in mobile devices. As storage capacity increases, the I/O speed should also increase accordingly. However, conventional memory cards require strong ESD protection, limiting high-speed data transfer. A non-contact memory card [1] is one of the solutions to this problem. No signal terminals are exposed for mechanical contact, which relaxes ESD constraints. A data transfer rate of 6Gb/s/ch by inductive coupling [1] and 12Gb/s/ch by transmission-line coupling [2] are reported. The post-UHS-II speed over 5Gb/s can be covered with around 10mW power consumption. Moreover, by supplying power wirelessly, mechanical connections can be completely removed, which could provide features such as waterproof capability or a new attach-remove user interface. A >50% high-efficient wireless power delivery has been reported [3]. However, it mainly supplies a large amount of active power, and the efficiency drops to ~10% in low-power standby mode. Shutting down the power delivery in standby would require a power-on sequence and an unacceptably long suspend (~10s) for each new command. For high-speed card access, the power delivery and the wireless data receiver (RX) should always be active, consuming about 2mW in RX and in total 20mW including loss in the wireless power delivery. This standby power is almost identical to that of typical smartphones, tablet-PCs, or camcorders and the battery life halves.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487705","","Clocks;Coils;Couplings;Oscillators;Receivers;Transceivers;Wireless communication","electrostatic discharge;flash memories;transceivers","ESD protection;I-O speed;WLAN;attach-remove user interface;battery charge;battery life;camcorders;cloud computing;detachable media;electronic systems;high-speed card access;high-speed data transfer;inductive coupling;inductive-coupling wake-up transceiver;internal storage area;local memory card storage;low-power standby mode;mechanical connections;mobile devices;noncontact memory card;post-UHS-II speed;power 20 mW;power 6 nW;power-on sequence;smartphone;standby power reduction;tablet-PC;transmission-line coupling;waterproof capability;wireless data receiver;wireless power delivery","","0","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, since the signals of interest are typically near DC, such ADCs must employ robust offset and 1/f noise-reduction techniques. Fulfilling these requirements often results in ADCs with poor energy efficiency, thus preventing their use in systems powered by batteries or energy scavengers. This paper describes a micro-power incremental ADC that achieves 20b resolution, 1μV offset and 6ppm INL, while dissipating more than an order of magnitude less energy than ADCs with comparable precision [3-6].

It is to be expected that future generations of these applications will require a higher ADC sampling rate, while maintaining good high-frequency linearity. Furthermore, a high spectral purity is desired, as spurs can cause an SNR degradation of several dB for weak narrowband signals. For interleaved converters, this mandates an output with limited interleaving artifacts. For the reception of broadband and multi-carrier signals, the gain mismatch and time-skew tones do not typically limit performance, since the spurs are evenly spread over frequency due to the broadband nature of the input signal.

As shown in Fig. 22.3.1, key components of the system include a logarithmic, digital-to-resistance converter (DRC) that forms the load of an external photodiode, and a non-uniform quantizer that provides error information to a digital accumulator controlling the DRC input. As the photodiode current fluctuates due to HR-induced pulsing of bloodflow through the tissue, the feedback loop adjusts the DRC load resistance in order to maintain constant voltage across the photodiode. As such, the accumulator output, OUT<sub>ADC</sub>[k], provides a digital representation of HR-induced fluctuations of the photodiode current, and the logarithmic implementation of the DRC accommodates 3 orders of magnitude in light intensity. In order to obtain instantaneous HR frequency, HR[k], off-chip digital signal processing is performed on OUT<sub>ADC</sub>[k].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487780","","CMOS integrated circuits;Current measurement;Frequency measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Photodiodes;Quantization (signal)","CMOS integrated circuits;biological tissues;biomedical electronics;cardiology;electric resistance;feedback;fluctuations;haemodynamics;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;photodiodes;photoplethysmography;sensors","DRC load resistance;HR-induced fluctuations;bloodflow pulse;constant voltage;continuous health-monitoring applications;digital accumulator control;digital representation;electrode-free operation;error information;external photodiode;feedback loop;fluctuation measurement;heart-rate monitor IC;instantaneous HR frequency;light intensity;logarithmic digital-to-resistance converter;nonuniform quantizer-based CMOS photoplethysmographic heart-rate sensor IC;off-chip digital signal processing;photodiode current fluctuation;photoplethysmographic biosensing;voltage 0.5 V","","2","","4","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A proprietary 2Mb/s mode is also implemented to support data-streaming applications like hearing aids. Current short-range radios for Zigbee and BT-LE typically consume more than 20mW DC power, which is rather high for autonomous systems with limited battery energy. The dual-mode MBAN/BT-LE transceiver achieves a power consumption of 6.5mW for the RX and 5.9mW for the TX by employing a sliding-IF RX and a polar TX architecture. However, it suffers from limited RX image rejection and needs a PA operating at a higher supply voltage. In this paper, an energy-efficient radio architecture with a suitable LO frequency plan is selected, and several efficiency-enhancement techniques for the critical RF circuits (e.g., a push-pull mixer and a digitally-assisted PA) are utilized. As a result, the presented transceiver dissipates only 3.8mW (RX) and 4.6mW (TX) DC power from a 1.2V supply, while exceeding all of the PHY requirements of above 3 standards.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487808","","Bluetooth;Frequency modulation;Mixers;Power demand;Standards;Transceivers;Zigbee","Bluetooth;Zigbee;body area networks;hearing aids;mixers (circuits);radio transceivers;radiofrequency integrated circuits","Bluetooth low energy;IEEE802.15.6 transceiver;PAN-BAN;RF circuits;ULP transceiver;Zigbee;autonomous systems;data streaming;dual-mode MBAN-BT-LE transceiver;frequency 2.36 GHz;frequency 2.4 GHz;hearing aids;image rejection;medical body-area networks;multistandard ultralow-power transceiver;personal-body-area networks;polar TX architecture;power 3.8 mW;power 4.6 mW;power 5.9 mW;power 6.5 mW;push-pull mixer;radio architecture;short-range standards;sliding-IF RX;voltage 1.2 V","","14","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further considering spreads due to process variations and the stringent reference phase noise to ensure signal integrity calls for an ultra-wide tuning range and low-noise on-chip oscillator. Meeting this target is even more challenging when adopting an ultra-scaled CMOS technology node where key passive components suffer from a reduced quality factor (Q) [1]. In a 32nm node the thickness of metals closer to the substrate is half that in a 65nm process leading, for example, to MOM capacitors with roughly half Q. The penalty is only marginally compensated by the higher transistor f<sub>t</sub>, improved only by ~20%. Various techniques exploiting alternative tuning implementations have been published recently. Magnetic tuning methods where the equivalent tank inductance is varied through reflection of the secondary coil impedance of a transformer demonstrate outstanding tuning ranges but at the cost of a severe trade-off with tank Q and poor noise FOMs [2,3]. A bank of capacitors switched in and out in an LC tank is the most popular tuning approach [4-6]. However the quality factor is severely degraded, when large ranges are involved. In this work, the switched-capacitor tank of the VCO shown in Fig. 20.3.1 is centered around two different resonance frequencies by splitting the inductor through the switch M<sub>sw</sub>. In particular, an up-shift is produced when the switch is off due to its parasitic capacitance. The frequency range is significantly increased without compromising tank Q leading to large tuning range and high FOM simultaneously. Prototypes of the VCO have been realized in 32nm CMOS showing the following performances: 31.6% frequency tuning range, minimum phase noise of -118dBc/Hz at 10MHz offset from 40GHz with 9.8mW power dissipation. Despite being realized in a- ultra-scaled 32nm standard digital CMOS process without RF thick metal options, the oscillator shows state-of-the-art performances.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487765","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Inductors;Phase noise;Switches;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;Q-factor;field effect MIMIC;inductors;millimetre wave oscillators;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS VCO;MOM capacitors;RF thick metal;capacitor switched bank;equivalent tank inductance;frequency 33.6 GHz to 46.2 GHz;frequency 57 GHz to 66 GHz;inductor splitting;low-noise on-chip oscillator;magnetic tuning methods;minimum noise FOM;parasitic capacitance;passive components;power 9.8 mW;power dissipation;reduced quality factor;resonance frequencies;secondary coil impedance;signal integrity;signal processing;size 32 nm;size 65 nm;stringent reference phase noise;switched-capacitor tank;transformer;transistor;tuning extension;ultrascaled CMOS technology node;ultrascaled standard digital CMOS technology;ultrawide tuning range;wireless transceivers","","3","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an array RF PA able to deliver a large output power from a large supply voltage through the use of three techniques illustrated in Fig. 5.4.1: (1) series-parallel transformers, (2) transistor stacking, and (3) amplifier stacking. First, the array RF PA employs series-parallel combinations of transformers to provide simultaneous impedance transformation and power combining over a wide bandwidth. The integrated on-chip impedance transformation is more robust and reproducible than off-chip matching using discrete passive components. Second, stacking transistors in the array RF PA increases the output power provided by each of the unit PA stages comprising the array. Third, two PAs are stacked [1].

Their severe energy constraint is often addressed through minimizing the amount of transmitted data by way of energy-efficient on-node signal processing. The rationale for this approach is that a large portion of WSN energy is consumed by the radio communication even for very low-data-rate situations [1]. Efficient on-node processing has been the subject of recent work, with the common element being aggressive voltage scaling into the sub-threshold region [2-4]. A major assumption of the existing works is that the amount of required computation is low, justifying an on-node processor with limited computational capability.

Recent works have realized a 60GHz transceiver by means of a cost-effective CMOS process [1-3], but using a 60GHz system in mobile terminals poses the difficult challenge of achieving low power consumption as well as small form factor. The publication [3] achieves a power consumption of less than 756mW, but uses a simple MAC protocol incompatible with global standards and also suffers from a limited distance of less than 4cm. This paper presents a fully integrated transceiver chipset based on WiGig/IEEE802.11ad standards targeting mobile usage. The chipset is developed for a single-carrier (SC) modulation, which is suitable for reduced power consumption as compared to using OFDM modulation. However, the SC modulation is sensitive to in-band amplitude variation, mainly made worse by the gain variation of analog circuits and multipath delay spread. In order to compensate for those gain variations, the proposed chipset employs built-in TX in-band calibration and an RX frequency domain equalizer (FDE). The proposed techniques can relax the requirement for high speed analog circuits, leading to less power consumption while minimizing the increase of hardware size.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487712","","CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Modulation;Power demand;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Transceivers;Wireless communication","CMOS integrated circuits;OFDM modulation;access protocols;built-in self test;calibration;low-power electronics;millimetre wave integrated circuits;mobile radio;radio transceivers;wireless LAN","FDE;MAC protocol;OFDM modulation;RX frequency domain equalizer;SC modulation;TX in-band calibration;WiGig-IEEE 802.11;built-in self calibration;cost-effective process;form factor;frequency 60 GHz;fully integrated CMOS transceiver chipset;gain variations;global standards;hardware size minimization;high speed analog circuits;in-band amplitude variation;low power consumption;mobile applications;mobile terminals;mobile usage;multipath delay spread;short-range wireless system;single-carrier modulation;wireless data transfer;wireless high-definition video links","","13","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, earlier demonstrations of CNFET-based circuits included only small stand-alone components such as an adder sum, latch, percolation transport-based decoder, and ring oscillator on a single CNT [4]. Because it is easier to implement digital circuits using immature technologies compared to analog circuits, highly-digital sensor interfaces such as the PLL-based design in [5] are ideal implementations when using a new technology. The implemented capacitive sensor interface is based on a first-order Bang-Bang Phase-Locked Loop (BBPLL) digital architecture, which processes the sensor information entirely in the frequency domain (Fig. 6.8.1).

N-path mixers can be used as mixer-first receivers [1] with good linearity and RF filtering [2]. However, 1/f noise calls for large active device sizes for IF circuits and high power consumption. The 1/f noise issue can be relaxed by having RF gain. However, to avoid desensitization by large out-of-band blockers, a bandpass filter (BPF) with sharp cut-off frequency is required in front of the RF amplifiers. g<sub>m</sub>-C BPFs suffer from tight tradeoffs among DR, power consumption, Q and f<sub>c</sub>. Also, on-chip Q-enhanced LC BPFs [3] are not suitable due to low DR, large area and non-tunability. Therefore, bulky and non-tunable SAW filters are used. N-path BPFs offer high Q while their center frequency is tuned by the clock frequency [2]. Compared to g<sub>m</sub>-C filters, this technique decouples the required Q from the DR. The 4-path filter in [4] has only 2<sup>nd</sup>-order filtering and limited rejection. The order and rejection of N-path BPFs can be increased by cascading [5], but this renders a “round” passband shape. The 4<sup>th</sup>-order 4-path BPF in [6] has a “flat” passband shape and high rejection but a high NF.

This rolling exposure causes so-called “Jell-o effect” distortion when capturing a moving target. CMOS image sensors with a global-shutter function are one of the solutions to avoid this distortion. An in-pixel storage node is required to create a global-shutter CMOS image sensor. A floating diffusion and an additional capacitor can be used as an in-pixel storage node [1,2]. The light sensitivity of the in-pixel storage node is specified by the parasitic light sensitivity (PLS), which is the ratio of the light sensitivity of an in-pixel storage node and the light sensitivity of a photodiode. The PLS should be small enough so that the in-pixel storage is not light-sensitive. Artifacts are captured in an image from bright moving objects during read-out if the PLS is not small enough. The PLS of reported global-shutter CMOS image sensors is around -100dB. That would be small enough to use those image sensors in fields where the light source can be controlled. However, for DSC usage, users can easily encounter scenes with bright objects (e.g. sunlight or car headlights). Even if the in-pixel storage node is light-shielded, it is difficult to perfectly protect the in-pixel storage node from photo-generated carriers, as long as the in-pixel storage node and a photodiode are on the same silicon substrate. Meanwhile, 3D stacking technologies have been introduced for image sensors to give them more functionality and improved performance [3,4]. The reported minimum interconnection pitches for image sensors are over 20μm. These technologies do not fit the smaller pixel pitches of the image sensors in recent DSCs. In this paper, we report a rolling-shutter distortion-free 3D stacked image sensor with an in-pixel storage node of -160dB parasitic light sensitivity. The image sensor virtually achieves a global-shutter functi- n using a 4-times frame-shutter operation. The image sensor has 2 semiconductor substrates, where 1 substrate has a backside-illuminated photodiode array and the other a storage-node array. The image sensor achieves a PLS level of -160dB. The image sensor has 8.6μm pitched interconnections, and an interconnection yield of over 99.9% is achieved.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487824","","Arrays;Capacitors;Image sensors;Photodiodes;Sensitivity;Substrates;Transistors","CMOS image sensors;capacitors;photodiodes","3D stacking technologies;4-time frame-shutter operation;PLS level;backside-illuminated photodiode array;capacitor;floating diffusion;global-shutter CMOS image sensor;in-pixel storage node;jell-o effect distortion;light source;minimum interconnection pitches;parasitic light sensitivity;parasitic light sensitivity in-pixel storage node;photogenerated carriers;rolling exposure function;rolling-shutter distortion-free 3D stacked image sensor;semiconductor substrates;silicon substrate","","3","","4","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe two significant challenges in on-chip temperature sensing: 1) the increasing number of sensors, and 2) placing them in a regular manner (not solely on the potential hotspots). The number of sensors is mostly constrained by their area. Indeed, the sensor area is difficult to shrink since large delay lines or a BJT with a large ADC, and digital circuits are required to generate a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) signal [2,5,6]. Many-core processor architectures give rise to the second challenge, namely, the hotspot locations within many-core processors are difficult to predict since we cannot determine the task allocation (and heat) profile at design time [2].

Many recent works have aimed to enhance PA efficiency at back-off powers [1-4], but relatively few have integrated these techniques into a complete TX system. For example, previous designs employing digital polar or outphasing architectures often realized phase modulation with off-chip instruments. Similarly, while good close-in spectral performance has been shown, far-out spectral images remain problematic for TXs where the PA itself is digitally modulated.

This technology is based on a 20nm SoC process featuring high-κ metal gate and strain techniques for core logic transistors with low-power/high-performance and I/O transistors. A high-density and a high-performance embedded memory bit cell each has an area <;0.1μm<sup>2</sup>. This technology is targeted to high-density low-cost low-power high-performance applications, such as mobile applications with video. Increased threshold-voltage variation of scaled transistors reduces the static noise margin (SNM) and write margin (WM) of the SRAM bit cell. The effect is more predominant for the high-density SRAMs due to small device sizes and large memory capacity requirement for modern SoC design. Therefore, chip performance and minimum operating voltage (V<sub>DDmin</sub>) are both degraded by the embedded SRAM. Reducing the pass-gate strength or BL capacitance with slow WL rise are effective techniques to improve the SRAM cell stability [1,2]. Underdriving the pass-gate reduces the bit-cell read current but also reduces WM, resulting in SRAM performance degradation. Physically shortening the BL limits the SRAM array configuration. Lowering the SRAM cell power supply improves the WM [3,4], but is less effective than the negative-bitline-based write-assist technique. Compared to conventional techniques, this work presents a partially suppressed wordline (PSWL) scheme for read assist and a bitline-length-tracked negative-bitline-boosting (BT-NBL) scheme for write assist without significantly degrading SRAM performance.

As presented in [1], a 4b/cell Flash memory by using error-detection (ED) scheme stores 2b data on two sides of a memory cell individually. Since the noise margin becomes smaller, the distribution drifts due to program disturb, data retention and temperature variation will cause higher raw bit-error-rate (RBER) if the sensing level (voltage) are not adjusted accordingly. The ED scheme can detect the drift direction by counting and storing the number of cells (Ni) with threshold voltage (V<sub>TH</sub>) below the i<sup>th</sup> sensing level (V<sub>REF i</sub>). A simple example with page size 1KB is demonstrated in Fig. 12.7.1. During a read operation, the number of cells (N<sub>i, measured</sub>) whose V<sub>TH</sub> below V<sub>REF i</sub> is counted and compared to N<sub>i</sub>. The ED scheme can find out a sub-optimal sensing level when N<sub>i, measured</sub> and N<sub>i</sub> is close enough.

Since the adjacent distributions for 6b/cell are much closer to each other, even a BCH code with ED scheme fails to correct all the patterns. However, by using a new 1-3-3 mapping and LDPC codes with a developed drift-immune soft-sensing (DI-SS) engine, the 45nm 4b/cell CT Flash memory is boosted to 6b/cell.

Compared with the self-capacitance types, which offer low cost and high scan frequency from the simple line-sensing scheme, the mutual-capacitance types, which read out all sensor pixels, are presently widely preferred due to their multi-touch capabilities.

Clinical studies have revealed that hundreds of channels are needed to restore functional visual perception, and more sophisticated waveforms present advantages over biphasic pulses. Initial designs targeted stimulation current levels up to 1mA to ensure functionality. For such designs, an output compliance of >10V was required, and HV technologies were used at the expense of area and power consumption. Human clinical trials have recently shown that implanted electrodes present a stimulus threshold as low as 50μA. In addition, advances in implant technology promise close placement of electrode array and retinal tissue, which can further decrease the required current. Thus, highly scaled LV technologies can provide alternative means to reduce area and power, and to support hundreds of flexible independent channels for fully intraocular implants. In this paper, a self-calibrating 512-channel epiretinal prosthesis in 65nm CMOS is presented. It features dual-band telemetry for power and data, clock recovery, a 2-step calibration technique to match biphasic stimulation currents, and an independent arbitrary output waveform per channel.

With loop-filter power greatly reduced, power dissipation in multibit quantizers becomes especially significant. For example, the quantizer in [2] accounts for 2.8mW of 8.5mW total power dissipation. Also, the input capacitance of multibit quantizers and the output parasitics of excess loop delay (ELD) compensation DACs result in increased power demand for summing circuits. To minimize power dissipation, two recent works use 1b quantizers with FIR DACs and replace ELD compensation DACs with a DAC followed by analog filter [3] or with feedback to the pre-amplifier [4]. ELD compensation may also be realized using digital logic following the quantizer [5]. This paper presents a low-power solution based on a highly digital multibit quantizer with embedded feedback to compensate for finite opamp bandwidth along with ELD. The quantizer consumes less than 10% of the total power and simplifies the analog circuits into a single DAC plus a feedforward loop filter with relaxed opamp requirements. Digital correction at the modulator output suggested by early work [6] is employed to shape DAC mismatch with the inherent noise transfer function (NTF) and to further relax circuit constraints. These digitally assisted techniques enable a CT ΔΣ modulator to achieve an FoM below 28fJ/conv-step.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487729","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Delays;Finite impulse response filters;Modulation;Noise;Power harmonic filters","CMOS integrated circuits;delta-sigma modulation;digital-analogue conversion;operational amplifiers","28fJ/conv-step CT ΔΣ modulator;CMOS;DAC mismatch;analog circuit;continuous-time ΔΣ modulator;digital correction;excess loop delay;feedforward loop filter;finite opamp bandwidth;frequency 18 MHz;highly digital multibit quantizer;low-power solution;modulator output;noise figure 78 dB;noise transfer function;opamp requirement;single DAC;size 2 nm","","6","","8","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fortunately, vibrations are consistent and abundant in many applications, so ambient kinetic energy can be a viable source. Vibrations induce the charges in piezoelectric transducers to build electrostatic forces that damp vibrations and convert kinetic energy into the electrical domain. The shunting switches and switched-inductor circuit of bridge rectifiers in [1-2] increase this output energy by extending the damping (i.e., harvesting) duration within a vibration cycle. Because the output voltages of bridge rectifiers clamp and limit the electrical damping forces built, switched-inductor converters in [3-4], whose damping voltages can exceed their rectified outputs, draw more power from vibrations. Still, electrical-mechanical coupling factors in tiny transducers are low, so electrical damping forces (i.e., voltages) remain weak. Investing energy into the transducer can increase this force, but unlike in [5-6], which demand multiple inductors and high-voltage sources, the system presented here invests energy with only one inductor at low voltages.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487645","","Damping;Inductors;Investment;Logic gates;Manganese;Switches;Vibrations","CMOS integrated circuits;energy harvesting;inductors;piezoelectric transducers;switching convertors;vibrations","ambient kinetic energy;bridge rectifier clamp;damp vibrations;electrical damping forces;electrical domain;electrical-mechanical coupling factors;electrostatic forces;high-voltage sources;piezoelectric transducers;shunting switches;single-inductor CMOS energy-investing piezoelectric harvester;size 0.35 mum;switched-inductor circuit;switched-inductor converters","","3","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior solutions required separate coax cables to carry signals from each low-noise block (LNB) to set-top boxes in the home, resulting in high installation cost. An existing solution called analog single-wire multiswitch (ASWM) channel stacking uses an analog frequency translation switch located near the antenna LNB to select and output signals from multiple LNB's to a fixed frequency slot for each set-top box on a single cable [1]. Although the ASWM solution solves the problem of multiple cables, it does not provide enough flexibility and capability to increase the number of inputs, and it requires multiple external components like SAW filters which in turn would significantly increase cost [2]. This paper introduces an integrated digital single-wire multiswitch (DSWM) channel-stacking IC implemented in 45nm CMOS, which uses digital signal processing after wideband 9b 1.82GS/s ADC's to select and reorder transponder channels. The selected and reordered channels are digitally upconverted and are stacked into L-band through a 9b 5.46GS/s DAC. It removes the need of in-band SAW filters, offers a full flexibility of channel selection, and supports many more satellites through a single L-band cable to set-top boxes at much lower cost and lower power consumption.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487719","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487719","","CMOS integrated circuits;Digital signal processing;Finite impulse response filters;Frequency shift keying;Radio frequency;Time-domain analysis;Transponders","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;coaxial cables;digital-analogue conversion;satellite communication;transponders","ADC;ASWM channel stacking;CMOS;DAC;L-band cable;analog frequency translation switch;analog single-wire multiswitch channel stacking;antenna LNB;channel selection;coax cables;digital signal processing;direct-to-home transmit-receive systems;in-band SAW filters;installation cost;integrated DSWM channel-stacking IC;integrated digital single-wire multiswitch channel-stacking IC;low-noise block;satellite outdoor units;set-top boxes;size 45 nm;switch-route signals;transponder channels","","0","","3","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Resistor Johnson noise is fixed by the DAC's code-independent output resistance, which is readily lowered by the combination of several parallel segments. The complete signal path can be built using opamps that have a minimal noise gain of unity. This architecture also benefits from inherently zero endpoint error, avoiding any gain or offset drift over temperature.

Among the numerous resonant wireless power transfer (RWPT) mechanisms, the one using 6.78MHz or 13.56MHz band for f<sub>RS</sub> has been a the mainstream option [1-2]. Major sources of power loss related to efficiency degradation are the transmitter circuits, receiver circuits, and resonant tanks of both sides. The efficiency of the receiver circuit is more important since it is especially related to the thermal emission of hands-on mobile devices and has to meet a strict value because the recent mobile phones already spend most of their thermal margins on the application processor. In this paper, we suggest a new receiver circuit for RWPT with simple structure and high efficiency.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487638","","RLC circuits;Receivers;Rectifiers;Switches;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Zero current switching","inductive power transmission;rectifying circuits","RWPT mechanisms;application processor;efficiency 86 percent;frequency 13.56 MHz;frequency 6.78 MHz;hands-on mobile devices;inductive type wireless power transfer mechanism;mobile phones;power 6 W;power loss;receiver;receiver circuits;resonant regulating rectifier;resonant tanks;resonant wireless power transfer mechanisms;thermal emission;thermal margins;transmitter circuits;wireless charger","","3","","4","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this research is to reduce the energy consumed per bit transmitted, while achieving Gb/s data rates over interconnect lengths up to 10mm. Voltage-mode signaling with capacitive boosting [1-2] has been proposed for low-power on-chip interconnects. To increase the data rate over RC-limited interconnect, aggressive equalization schemes should be used in receivers [1-3] and transmitters [1-2] at the cost of significant power consumption. As an alternative to voltage-mode signaling, current-mode signaling has been considered. It was originally used for fast bitline sensing in memory [4-5] to take inherent advantage of a reduced RC time constant. However, prior work on current-mode transceivers for on-chip interconnect shows worse energy efficiency than their voltage-mode counterparts due to large static power dissipation by current-sensing circuit [6-7]. This paper presents a 95fJ/b current-mode transceiver for on-chip global interconnect.

Multiplying Delay-Locked Loop (MDLL) [1-2], subharmonically injection-locked techniques [3], and sub-sampling techniques [4-5] can significantly improve the random jitter characteristics of a clock generator. However, in order to guarantee their correct operation and optimal performance over process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, each method requires additional calibration circuits, which impose difficult-to-meet timing constraints. In the case of an injection-locked PLL (IL-PLL), a free-running frequency calibration is required. However, the output of an injection-locked oscillator is always fixed at the desired frequency, so a shift in the free-running frequency (e.g. caused by temperature and voltage variations) cannot be simply compensated for by using a frequency-locked loop (FLL). Therefore, we propose the use of a dual-loop topology with one free-running voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as a replica VCO placed inside a FLL for tracking temperature and voltage drift. The other VCO (the main VCO) is injection locked for producing a low-jitter clock, while the free-running frequency shift can be compensated for by the replica loop. The method provides robust output over temperature and voltage variations.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487720","","Calibration;Clocks;Frequency locked loops;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Temperature measurement;Voltage-controlled oscillators","calibration;clocks;delay lock loops;digital phase locked loops;frequency locked loops;timing jitter;voltage-controlled oscillators","FLL;FOM;IL-PLL;MDLL;SoC systems;all-digital PVT calibration circuits;dual-loop injection-locked PLL;dual-loop topology;free-running VCO;free-running frequency calibration;free-running frequency shift;free-running voltage-controlled oscillator;frequency-locked loop;injection-locked oscillator;jitter performance;low-area low-power consumption;multiplying delay-locked loop;on-chip clock generators;power 970 muW;process-voltage-temperature variations;random jitter characteristics;subharmonically-injection-locked technique;subsampling technique;temperature tracking;voltage drift","","1","2","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finer timing resolution is needed to reduce the quantization noise in the phase domain. In conventional designs, a phase interpolator (PI) is used to suppress the quantization noise due to its simplicity, but at a cost of gain error and non-linearity. These sub-phase non-idealities result in large fractional spurs [2-5]. Techniques for reducing these spurs include using a PI mismatch and spur-cancellation scheme [2], digital correlation and cancellation [3], use of a successive requantizer with switched loop filter and offset charge-pump [4], and foreground calibration [5]. This paper presents a ring-oscillator based 2MHz bandwidth fractional-N PLL that uses a spectrally shaped segmented-feedback approach to alleviate fractional spurs induced by the PI non-idealities. This approach results in a compact design and, in contrast to previous work, achieves a 26dB spur reduction without need of correlation, cancellation, or calibration methods.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487795","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Modulation;Noise;Phase locked loops;Quantization (signal);Voltage-controlled oscillators","circuit feedback;interference suppression;oscillators;phase locked loops","digital correlation;finer timing resolution;foreground calibration;fractional-spur suppression;frequency 2 MHz;gain error cost;offset charge-pump;phase interpolator;quantization noise reduction;ring-oscillator;spectrally shaped segmentation;spectrally shaped segmented-feedback approach;spur-cancellation scheme;successive requantizer;switched loop filter;wideband fractional-N ring PLL;wireless circuits;wireline circuits","","2","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clock-recovery circuits consume a large portion of the I/O power. PLL/DLLs with a phase interpolator are widely used for the clock recovery circuits. However, they dissipate high power and jitter-tracking bandwidth (JTB) is low (PLL) or high (DLL), degrading the jitter correlation between data and clock. Recently, injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) have drawn much attention for the clock-recovery circuit of the FC interfaces due to their low power consumption [3-6]. By de-tuning the free-running frequency of an ILO, clock deskew can be performed and multiphase clocks can be generated without an additional multiphase generator. Also, ILOs can provide JTB of several hundred MHz, which is optimal for the FC interfaces in terms of the jitter correlation and BER [5].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487792","","Clocks;Delays;Feedback loop;Jitter;Mixers;Phase measurement;Receivers","clock and data recovery circuits;delay lock loops;injection locked oscillators;phase locked loops","BER;FC interfaces;I-O power;ILO;JTB;PLL-DLL;aggregate bandwidth;bit rate 8 Gbit/s;chip-to-chip parallel interface;clock deskew;clock inherent correlation;clock-recovery circuits;data jitter;dual-feedback loop;forwarded-clock architecture;forwarded-clock receiver;free-running frequency;injection-locked oscillators;jitter correlation;jitter-tracking bandwidth;multiphase clocks;multiphase generator;phase interpolator;power consumption;quadrature injection scheme","","1","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Serial signal-processing architectures, in which signal-processing circuits such as a programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) and an ADC can be shared by column-level correlated double sampling (CDS) circuits, promise to reduce chip size and power consumption. However, conventional column CDS circuits composed of linear capacitors or NMOS capacitors (NMOSCAPs) with output buffers (OBUFs) still occupy a large footprint. In this work, to reduce the area and the power consumption of column CDS circuits while keeping high linearity, 1.5V PMOS capacitors (PMOSCAPs) are employed. These capacitors work as low-cost sample-and-hold (S/H) capacitors as well as voltage level-shifters by using body-terminal control. To reduce the power consumption of the ADC, instead of a conventional pipeline ADC, we propose a 10b self-differential offset-cancelled pipeline SAR-ADC. It operates with the reference voltage of the ADC's half full-scale voltage (V<sub>fs</sub>), leading to a reduction of 80% switching power and 50% capacitor DAC (CDAC) area in the ADC. A black-level correction function is built in the ADC without any additional DACs.

Hence, a reconfigurable TX that can support multichannel and multimodulation with reconfigurable data rate, spectrum and energy efficiency would be desirable. Although a conventional mixer-based or fractional-N-PLL-based TX with two-point modulation [4] can achieve the aim, the need of power hungry blocks and sophisticated calibration does not lead to power-efficient solutions. On the other hand, energy efficient injection-locked FSK or QPSK TX with good noise performance does not provide multichannel support due to the use of fixed references [2-3]. Energy efficient FSK TXs [5] with open-loop VCO have also been reported.

State-of-the-art channel codes including turbo and binary LDPC have been extensively used in recent applications [1-2] to close the gap towards the lowest possible SNR, known as the Shannon limit. The recently developed nonbinary LDPC (NB-LDPC) code, defined over Galois field (GF), holds great promise for approaching the Shannon limit [3]. It offers better coding gain and a lower error floor than binary LDPC. However, the complex nonbinary decoding prevents any practical chip implementation to date. A handful of FPGA designs and chip synthesis results have demonstrated throughputs up to only 50Mb/s [4-6]. In this paper, we present a 1.15Gb/s fully parallel decoder of a (960, 480) regular-(2, 4) NB-LDPC code over GF(64) in 65nm CMOS. The natural bundling of global interconnects and an optimized placement permit 87% logic utilization that is significantly higher than a fully parallel binary LDPC decoder [7]. To achieve high energy efficiency, each processing node detects its own convergence and applies dynamic clock gating, and the decoder terminates when all nodes are clock gated. The dynamic clock gating and termination reduce the energy consumption by 62% for energy efficiency of 3.37nJ/b, or 277pJ/b/iteration, at a 1V supply.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487797","","Clocks;Decoding;Energy efficiency;Logic gates;Parity check codes;Signal to noise ratio;Throughput","CMOS integrated circuits;Galois fields;binary codes;channel coding;decoding;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;parity check codes","CMOS process;FPGA designs;Galois field;NB-LDPC code;SNR;Shannon limit;bit rate 1.15 Gbit/s;channel codes;chip synthesis;coding gain;complex nonbinary decoding;efficiency 62 percent;energy consumption;energy efficiency;fine-grained dynamic clock gating;fully parallel binary LDPC decoder;fully parallel nonbinary LDPC decoder;signal-to-noise ratio;size 65 nm;storage system;turbo codes;voltage 1 V","","3","","8","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method of using a divide-by-2 divider after a VCO with double LO frequency is popular in multi-GHz designs, but it is difficult to be realized at mm-Wave frequencies. Employing passive RC complex filters is another way to generate quadrature signals, but high power is required to compensate its loss. The conventional parallel-coupled QVCO seems to be a good choice for mm-Wave application. However, the approach suffers from poor phase noise.

To do this, a broadband THz radiation source is critical. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of the prior CMOS works is not sufficient. In [1], the 300GHz signal source achieves 4.5% tuning range by changing the coupling among multiple oscillators. In [2], the DAR array has 3% tuning range with radiation capability. Alternative to the continuous device-tuning method, THz time-domain spectroscopy utilizing the broadband spectrum of picosecond pulses is widely used in the optics community [3]. In this paper, a high-power pulse-based sub-millimeter-Wave radiation source using 65nm bulk CMOS technology is reported. The architecture of this transmitter is shown in Fig. 8.2.1, where four differential core oscillator pairs are mutually coupled through four quadrature oscillators. Each core oscillator pair generates 2<sup>nd</sup>-harmonic signals at 260GHz that are power-combined after radiating through eight on-chip antennas. Four shunt switches, controlled by narrow pulses (width≈45ps) modulate the radiation. The pulses are generated by local digital circuit blocks with programmable repetition rate up to 5GHz. This way, the broadband spectrum of the pulses is upconverted to the carrier frequency of 260GHz. Without modulation, the chip achieves a continuous-wave radiated power of 1.1mW. Under modulation, the measured bandwidth of the source is 24.7GHz, which makes it suitable for many FTIR-based THz spectrometers. In addition, if the switches are modulated by digital data, this chip can also be used as a transmitter for sub-millimeter/THz wireless communications.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487671","","Bandwidth;Broadband antennas;Broadband communication;CMOS integrated circuits;Harmonic analysis;Oscillators;Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS integrated circuits;field effect MIMIC;millimetre wave oscillators;radio transmitters;switches;terahertz spectroscopy","DAR array;EIRP;FTIR-based THz spectrometers;THz time-domain spectroscopy;bandwidth 24.7 GHz;broadband THz radiation source;broadband source;broadband spectrum;bulk CMOS technology;continuous device-tuning method;continuous-wave radiated power;differential core oscillator pairs;frequency 260 GHz;frequency 300 GHz;high-power pulse-based submillimeter-wave radiation;local digital circuit blocks;material identification equipment;multiple oscillators;on-chip antennas;picosecond pulses;power 1.1 mW;quadrature oscillators;shunt switches;silicon technology;size 65 nm;submillimeter-THz wireless communications;terahertz spectroscopy;transmitter","","5","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A 5.6mV inter-channel DVO 10b column-driver IC with mismatch-free switched-capacitor interpolation for mobile active-matrix LCDs","Hyun-Sik Kim; Jun-Hyeok Yang; Sang-hui Park; Seung-Tak Ryu; Gyu-Hyeong Cho","KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2013 IEEE International","20130328","2013","","","392","393","To achieve high image quality in mobile active-matrix LCDs, higher DAC resolution and good channel-to-channel uniformity are required in column-driver ICs. In conventional column-driver ICs, the resistor-DAC (R-DAC) architecture has been generally used due to its uniform characteristic, because each R-DAC in driver channels shares a common resistor string for gamma reference-voltage generation. Furthermore, nonlinear gamma correction can be easily implemented using a nonlinear resistor-string that has an inverse transfer curve to the liquid crystal (LC) response. However, the increase in color depth for LCDs results in a large chip-size overhead, thus disclosing the limitation of the R-DAC architecture. To overcome this issue, several hybrid DAC architectures composed of a main 6b R-DAC and a 4b sub-DAC with various interpolation schemes have been reported [1-5]. Their linear interpolation schemes reduce the driver channel size. Meanwhile, their linear 4b interpolation leads to the loss of effective bit resolution for nonlinear gamma correction. In addition, the inevitable mismatch between respective sub-DACs has a significant influence on the channel-to-channel uniform performance of a column-driver IC. In this paper, we present a 10b column-driver IC with a mismatch-free switched-capacitor (SC) interpolation scheme for mobile AMLCDs. The proposed mismatch-free interpolation scheme provides further reduction of the driver size, good linearity, highly uniform channel performance, and more effective bit resolution.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487784","","Active matrix technology;Capacitors;Integrated circuits;Interpolation;Mobile communication;Switches;Voltage measurement","capacitor switching;digital-analogue conversion;driver circuits;interpolation;liquid crystal displays;matrix algebra;resistors","LC response;R-DAC architecture;channel-to-channel uniformity;column-driver IC;common resistor;gamma reference-voltage generation;high image quality;higher DAC resolution;interchannel DVO;interpolation schemes;liq- uid crystal response;mismatch-free SC interpolation scheme;mismatch-free switched-capacitor interpolation;mobile active-matrix LCD;nonlinear gamma correction;nonlinear resistor-string;resistor-DAC architecture;voltage 5.6 mV","","2","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the area and leakage power benefits of eDRAM continue to be leveraged in applications with large contiguous memory blocks [2], SRAM leakage remains a significant portion of the total SoC power. This work describes an SRAM that is optimized for leakage and performance as top priorities over density. The SRAM features a new bitcell (BC) implemented with a fine-granularity power-gating (FGPG) technique to reduce BC leakage by 37%. FGPG improves leakage reduction by 2× compared to bank-based power-gating (PG) techniques [3-4]. Periphery leakage is also reduced by 40% from the previous design [5] with a low-energy power-supply-partition design that leverages higher V<sub>t</sub> devices operating at a higher supply voltage.

Although traditional H-tree clock distribution circuits are widely used, the clock skew of such circuits is increased by the PVT variations associated with device scaling [1]. In recent years, there has thus been a growing interest in resonant clock distribution schemes for reduced clock skew. In particular, coupled ring oscillators with shorted outputs [2] can reduce skew and jitter without additional layout area compared to LC resonators [3]. The difference in phase and frequency of each oscillator (due to PVT variations) is equalized by the mutual connection between the oscillators. Power dissipation can also be reduced, as the enhanced variability tolerance may permit operation at lower voltages.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487725","","Clocks;Frequency locked loops;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Ring oscillators;Synchronization","LC circuits;clocks;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;jitter;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;oscillators;resonators","3D clock distribution;H-tree clock distribution circuit;LC resonator;PVT variation;clock skew;coupled ring oscillator;device scaling;high-performance microprocessor;jitter;low power;oscillator frequency;oscillator phase;power dissipation;resonant clock distribution;variability tolerance;vertically/horizontally-coupled resonator","","0","","8","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the bit rate increases, jitter of PLL, data-sampling margin, crosstalk and intersymbol interference (ISI) needs considerable management [1,3,5]. Moreover, as the supply voltage decreases, the self-generated internal noise of DRAM increases due to low efficiency of the internal voltage generator, especially the VPP voltage generator [2]. In general, the sensitivity of PLL to supply noise gives rise to large jitter accumulation. If the supply noise frequency is close to the PLL bandwidth, more jitter peaking occurs. Therefore, the PLL bandwidth is an important parameter to achieve low jitter performance [3]. Crosstalk becomes a crucial issue for over 7Gb/s GDDR interface [1]. However, the complexity of the transmitter and the C<sub>IO</sub>, capacitance of I/O, increase due to additional equalizers and pre- and de-emphasis drivers. For a compact transmitter, a low-overhead boosted transmitter is developed [4].

Conventional multipoint measurements with a passive electrode array [1-3], however, have two problems: 1) Measurement over a long time period is annoying, because the EMG electrodes placed on the skin are rigid, and 2) the signal integrity of EMG is degraded, because the number of wires between the electrodes and the front-end circuits increases with increasing number of measurement points.

While CS mismatch and input-code dependent switching transients result in distortion tones, the parasitic capacitor-induced finite output impedance further limits the high-linearity bandwidth and causes the SFDR to drop at high signal frequencies.

"A phase-noise and spur filtering technique using reciprocal-mixing cancellation","Mikhemar, M.; Murphy, D.; Mirzaei, A.; Darabi, H.","Broadcom, Irvine, CA, USA","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2013 IEEE International","20130328","2013","","","86","87","Recent passive-mixer-based architectures, such as [1], have shown that blockers as large as 0dBm can be tolerated without excessive gain compression. However, even in a perfectly linear receiver, reciprocal mixing of the blocker with LO phase noise deposits additive noise on the wanted signal, as shown in Fig. 5.3.1. This is an inevitable limitation to any mixer-based receiver. Assuming that the blocker experiences no passive RF filtering, the noise figure of such a receiver in the presence of a given blocker is only lowered through improving the LO phase noise. To overcome this challenge, most wireless receivers use LC-oscillators that despite their superior phase noise to ring oscillators [2], still consume a large portion of the radio power. As the quality factor of on-chip resonators does not scale with technology, the phase noise of an LC-oscillator can only be improved by consuming more power, while the benefits of circuit innovation are fundamentally limited [3]. Although increasing current helps, it does come at a cost, and is ultimately limited by the maximum allowable amplitude, and how reliably small inductor values can be fabricated without Q-degradation. In this paper, we propose a mixed-signal reciprocal-mixing cancellation technique that leads to a substantial reciprocal-mixing noise figure improvement independent of the LO phase noise.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487648","","Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Noise figure;Phase noise;Power harmonic filters;Receivers","Q-factor;filtering theory;oscillators;phase noise;radio receivers","LC-oscillators;LO phase noise;additive noise;mixed-signal reciprocal-mixing cancellation technique;mixer-based receiver;on-chip resonators;passive-mixer-based architectures;perfectly linear receiver;quality factor;reciprocal-mixing noise figure improvement;ring oscillators;spur filtering technique;wireless receivers","","4","","3","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, DFE's operating speed is fundamentally limited by a 1-unit-interval (UI) feedback loop that is often the critical path in high-speed designs. Partial-response DFE (prDFE) architectures push the feedback loop away from the analog front-end to the post-slicer domain by making redundant decisions, as shown in Fig. 2.8.1(a). Since distinction between post and current data requires a sequential element to prevent a race, a latch overhead exists in the critical path of many prDFE designs [1]. For a 1-tap prDFE, the design in [2] entirely eliminates the sequential element from the critical path leveraging a unique race-free property of 1-tap half-rate prDFE. However, the architecture is not extendable to larger number of taps. For a 2-tap prDFE, overhead of the sequential element is reduced in a quarter-rate architecture. Figure 2.8.1(b) shows the block diagram of a receiver front-end with a shared CTLE, half-rate slicers and a quarter-rate prDFE. The critical path in the quarter-rate implementation is limited by a 2:1 mux delay (T<sub>mux</sub>) and a flop setup and clock-to-output overhead (T<sub>FF</sub>), as shown in Fig. 2.8.2(a). Assuming T<sub>FF</sub> = 2T<sub>mux</sub>, the loop delay increases by 200% compared to the absolute minimum for speculation, T<sub>mux</sub>.

The TX features extensive reconfigurability and permits the highest degree of integration of RF and baseband circuitry for low-cost, high-volume applications.

By turning off the circuits that are not in use, power cycling provides a viable means to make power dissipation proportional to workload, hence achieving energy proportional operation. The effectiveness of this approach is governed by the turn on/off times, off-state power dissipation, and energy overhead due to power-cycling. Ideally, the circuits must turn on/off in zero time, consume no off-state power, and incur minimal energy overhead during on-to-off and off-to-on transitions. Conventional clock multipliers implemented using phase-locked loops (PLLs) present the biggest bottleneck in achieving these performance goals due to their long locking times. Even if the PLL is frequency locked, the slow phase acquisition process limits the power-on time [1-2]. Techniques such as dynamic phase-error compensation [3], edge-missing compensation [4], and hybrid PLLs [5] improve the phase acquisition time to at best few hundred reference cycles. However, such improvements are inadequate to make best use of power-cycling. Multiplying injection-locked oscillators (MILO) are shown to lock faster than PLLs, but suffer from conflicting requirements on injection strength to simultaneously achieve low jitter and fast locking. Increasing the injection strength extends lock range and reduces locking time, but severely degrades the deterministic jitter performance [6]. In view of these drawbacks, we propose a highly digital clock multiplier that seeks to achieve low jitter, fast locking, and near-zero off-state power. By using a highly scalable digital architecture with accurate frequency presetting and instantaneous phase acquisition, the prototype 8×/16× clock multiplier achieves 10ns (3 reference cycles) power-on time, 2ps<sub>rms</sub> long-term absolute jitter, less than 25μW off-state power, 12pJ energy overhead for on/off transition, and 2.2mW on-state - ower at 2.5GHz output frequency.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487724","","Capacitors;Clocks;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase locked loops;Solid state circuits;Time-frequency analysis","battery management systems;clocks;error compensation;injection locked oscillators;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops","PLL;battery life;clock multipliers;deterministic jitter performance;digital architecture;digital clock multiplier;dynamic phase error compensation;edge missing compensation;energy overhead;energy proportional operation;frequency 2.5 GHz;instantaneous phase acquisition;mobile platforms;multiplying injection locked oscillators;near zero offstate power;offstate power dissipation;phase locked loops;power 2.2 mW;power 25 muW;power cycling;reference cycles","","0","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the mm-scale, complete integration is necessary, and operation within the limits of a micro-battery becomes a primary challenge [1]. With CMOS scaling and ultra-low-power circuits reducing battery volume, the antenna and crystal quickly become the largest components in a cubic-mm node. Higher-frequency operation and silicon-based timing circuits are critical to integrate these components. This paper presents a fully-integrated 9.8GHz impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radio with an on-chip 2mm monopole and the option of wire-bonding to an off-chip antenna. The crystal is replaced with a novel temperature-compensated relaxation oscillator. Due to modern mm-scale battery limitations, the peak current draw must be <;100μA [2], far below typical radio power consumption. Furthermore, external capacitors are too large for mm-scale nodes; thus, duty-cycling only at the packet level is not an option. This IR-UWB radio includes current-limiting at the battery supply, and the integrated modem duty-cycles the RF front-end at the bit-level in order to operate from integrated storage capacitance. Finally, many recent transceivers operate at <;1V [3,4]; however the voltage of a micro-battery is 3.2~4.1V [2] and integrated conversion efficiency is <;80% [1,5]. Thus, this radio is designed to operate the RF blocks over the entire battery voltage range.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487806","","Baseband;Batteries;Capacitors;Oscillators;Radio frequency;Sensors;Transceivers","BiCMOS integrated circuits;bipolar MMIC;current limiters;field effect MMIC;modems;monopole antennas;ultra wideband communication","BiCMOS;RF front end;battery supply;current limiter;digital baseband;frequency 9.8 GHz;impulse radio;integrated modem;off-chip antenna;on-chip monopole;size 0.18 mum;size 2 mm;temperature compensated relaxation oscillator;ultra low-power crystal-less UWB transceiver;ultra wideband radio;wire bonding","","1","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sequential nature of the SAR algorithm makes it difficult to achieve both high speed and high accuracy, as increasing the resolution requires each bit decision to be both faster and lower noise.

Enabled by the advances in silicon technologies, a clear trend towards higher integration is observed [1-3]. Early-stage breast cancer detection is a promising application for radar imaging, as first clinical trials with patients have been carried out [4]. Commercial VNAs have been used in these experiments, but custom hardware is needed to improve the sensitivity, and to decrease the size and the cost of the setup [4]. Medical radar imaging sets great challenges. The radiation must be coupled into the body, while the skin acts as a shield. The waves that penetrate beyond the skin are heavily attenuated (>80dB for a few centimeters at 10GHz [4]). Tumor cells have different electrical properties than the healthy tissue, thus reflecting the waves and allowing for detection; this contrast is frequency dependent, decreasing at higher frequencies. These fundamental limits result in a radar requiring a dynamic range in excess to 100dB [4], and force operation in the lower-GHz range. In contrast, mm-Waves would be preferred to achieve higher resolution [1]. Ultra-wideband radars combine larger scattered energy collected at lower frequencies (thus higher SNR), and mm-range resolution, since the resolution is set by the overall bandwidth and the antenna array arrangement [2].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487717","","Harmonic analysis;Imaging;Mixers;Noise measurement;Power harmonic filters;Radar imaging","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;antenna arrays;cancer;image resolution;medical image processing;millimetre wave radar;radar antennas;radar imaging;ultra wideband radar","VNA;antenna array arrangement;breast cancer diagnostic imaging;early-stage breast cancer detection;electrical properties;frequency 2 GHz to 16 GHz;industrial application;medical application;medical radar imaging;mm-range resolution;mm-waves;power 204 mW;scattered energy;security application;silicon technologies;size 65 nm;stepped-frequency radar;tumor cells;ultrawideband radars","","2","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increasing data rate is a common solution, as I/O pad density is not scaling with bandwidth requirements. Copper interconnect has increasingly high loss with frequency, requiring complex, power-hungry equalization to overcome the channel response at high data rates. In contrast, optical interconnect can transport signals over long distances without complex equalization. Chip-to-chip optical interconnect will require sensitive, low-power, clocked receiver (RX) circuits that operate at high data rates. Conventional TIA-based RXs [1,2] require high power to maximize gain and minimize noise while maintaining high BW. A low-noise, low-BW, low-power TIA is combined with a 2-tap DFE to achieve high sensitivity in [3], but the data rate is 4Gb/s and limited dynamic range is demonstrated. Double-sampling architectures eliminate the TIA, replacing it with a large resistor [4] or a capacitive integrator [5], which decreases the front-end BW. The BW is equalized by double sampling, which is equivalent to a 2-tap FFE. However, the use of small sampling capacitors in [4,5] adds kT/C noise, limiting sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate an optical RX with a large input resistance to maximize gain and sensitivity, while DFE with IIR feedback (DFE-IIR) [6] eliminates the resulting ISI with minimal added noise.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487668","","CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Latches;Noise;Optical receivers;Sensitivity;Silicon germanium","IIR filters;decision feedback equalisers;low-power electronics;optical interconnections;optical receivers","DFE-IIR equalization;FPGA;I/O pad density;IIR feedback;bit rate 4 Gbit/s;capacitive integrator;channel response;chip-to-chip optical interconnect;computing systems;copper interconnect;data rate;double-sampling architectures;low-noise low-BW low-power TIA;low-power clocked receiver circuit;microprocessor chip;optical receivers;power-hungry equalization;small sampling capacitors;two-tap DFE","","4","","7","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The time-to-first-lock and location accuracy can be improved through simultaneous reception of two different satellite signals. This usually necessitates the use of two dedicated receivers [1] driven by a single and sometimes two separate synthesizers, which increases complexity, die area, and most importantly current consumption. To solve this problem, the architecture shown in Fig. 19.4.1 is proposed. The SoC consists of one single reconfigurable low-IF receiver, a single fractional-N frequency synthesizer, and a digital baseband processor. Since different satellite signals are uncorrelated and are buried well below the noise floor, they can be amplified and downconverted by the same RF/analog chain as an image of one another, and then separated in the digital domain by the corresponding correlator and signal processor. In the case of simultaneous GPS/Galileo and Glonass dual reception, the LO (f<sub>LO_GG</sub>) is set to 1588.608MHz. As a result, the GPS/Galileo signal becomes the image of the Glonass satellite signal with an IF frequency of 13.1MHz. Similarly, when the LO (f<sub>LO_GB</sub>) is set to 1568.256MHz, the resulting IF frequency is about 7.1MHz for GPS/Galileo and Beidou dual reception.

Razor systems offer even greater power efficiency by minimizing static supply voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) guardbands for process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variation, while also providing a degree of resilience to general delay faults (e.g. SEUs). To date, Razor has only been demonstrated on silicon in the context of microprocessor pipelines [1][2]. Reported Algorithmic Noise Tolerance (ANT) circuits [3][4] operate at very high error rates, but rely on imbalanced ripple-carry adders and hence clock frequency (F<sub>clk</sub>) is limited (50-88MHz). ANT also requires additional datapaths for error detection/correction, which cannot be clock gated in the absence of errors, increasing baseline area and power. Combining Razor error detection with algorithm-level correction enables high-F<sub>clk</sub> datapaths and low-overheads.

Aside from the higher power/data demand, the electrode impedance is also increased. Placing 1000 epiretinal electrodes in the 5mm-diameter macula region reduces the electrode size to less than 0.01mm<sup>2</sup>, leading to a 30kΩ electrode-tissue impedance [2].

Though transceivers for a data rate over 25Gb/s have been reported [1-3], designing clock-generating circuits for the receiver front-end is a significant challenge. In a phase interpolator (PI) commonly used in conventional receivers for a multi-channel configuration, both the linearity and frequency characteristics of the circuit affect the interpolation accuracy since it dynamically interpolates between reference clock signals supplied from a PLL, making the design more difficult. Blind-clock ADC-based receivers [4] eliminate the need for a clock-phase-adjusting circuit, but the area and power overheads are large due to high-sampling-rate ADCs. To address these issues, we fabricate and test a 28nm CMOS blind-clock receiver that performs phase tracking by using a data interpolator (DI). We confirm error-free operation of the receiver up to 32Gb/s with power consumption of 308.4mW from a 0.9V power supply.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487626","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Interpolation;Receivers;Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;clocks;phase locked loops;radio transceivers","2-tap DFE;CEI-56G-VSR;CMOS blind-clock receiver;OIF CEI-28G-SR;PI;PLL;bit rate 32 Gbit/s;blind-clock ADC-based receivers;circuit frequency characteristics;clock-generating circuit design;clock-phase-adjusting circuit;data-interpolator receiver;high-sampling-rate ADC;multichannel configuration;next-generation communication standards;phase interpolator;receiver front-end;reference clock signals;size 28 nm;transceivers","","2","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The receiver needs to reject large in-band and out-of-band blockers while detecting small desired signals. The transmitter needs to maintain high efficiency and low distortion, while processing signals with wider bandwidths and higher peak-to-average ratios to support high data rates. Recent developments in RF transceiver design utilize techniques that cancel noise and distortion in receiver and transmitter signal paths. Digital circuits and calibration are increasingly being used to aid radio performance and allow area reduction. This Forum will present advanced circuit design techniques that demonstrate the current state-of-the-art. System specifications will be discussed to provide context for the required circuit enhancements. The first three talks will focus on noise and distortion cancellation techniques used in receivers. The next three talks will focus on transmitter design including both digital and analog linearization techniques. Finally, the last talk will introduce in-device co-existence issues and solutions for wireless systems that require multiple radios operating concurrently.

One of the major limitations in this domain arises from the need of a low-power, lightweight, wireless recording unit that can be used on small animals for at least a couple of hours. To conserve power, it is essential to reduce the large data volume from tens or even hundreds of recording sites. Since it is widely considered that the primary information in neural recording is limited to the infrequent action potentials (AP or spike), the data can be considerably reduced by using a system based on AP activity [1]. This paper presents a complete activity-dependent wireless system that utilizes an ASIC for recording simultaneous AP and local field potential (LFP) signals, improving the state of the art in terms of performance-to-weight ratio. In spite of large data compression, we demonstrate a method to accurately preserve the AP shape, essential for further processing and spike sorting. Finally, this is the first system (see Fig. 16.4.6 comparison table) particularly designed to take advantage of tetrode (four closely placed electrodes) based neural recording units (Fig. 16.4.1).","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487740","","Animals;Application specific integrated circuits;Electrodes;Neuroscience;Power demand;Shape;Wireless communication","neural chips;recorders","ASIC;action potentials;activity dependent power consumption;activity dependent wireless system;data compression;dual band wireless neural recorder;freely behaving animals;local field potential signal;neural activity;neural recording units;neuroscience;spike sorting;wireless recording unit","","4","","9","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, high power consumption, low link density and high cost seriously prevent traditional MZI from being the next generation of optical link technology. To fundamentally reduce the cost of MZI, it is highly desirable to make the process CMOS compatible with high efficiency, thus the modulation voltage, size, and power can be reduced to a level where advanced sub-1V CMOS circuits can be used as the driver. This paper presents two CMOS-MZI-based optical transmitters, NRZ or configurable PAM-N (N = 4,16), featuring 20Gb/s data rate and sub-pJ/bit modulation energy (PAM-4) using a 1V supply.

However, due to the narrowing gap between the supply voltage and the threshold voltage, ULV designs inevitably suffer from either low performance or high leakage [1, 2]. Specifically, for applications that demand performance, low-threshold devices must be used and so leakage remains a significant problem. The most effective approach to cutting down leakage is power gating. In this regard, the SCCMOS [3] (Fig. 24.4.1, left) uses additional boost signals to “super cutoff” the leakage current. In SCCMOS, a charge pump is used to generate the boost signal, and the pump has to be on during the standby period to maintain the boost signal. As such, the leakage saved by the super cutoff may be far less than that consumed by the charge pump, negating the power advantages of ULV SCCMOS.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487799","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Leakage currents;Logic gates;Reduced instruction set computing;Solid state circuits;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;charge pump circuits;microprocessor chips","RISC core;ULV SCCMOS;ULV designs;charge pump;low-threshold devices;power consumption;self-super-cutoff power gating;size 0.13 mum;threshold voltage;ultralow-voltage design;voltage 0.3 V","","1","","5","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clock management unit, as an essential block, is one of the most actively researched blocks. It is required to distribute various frequency ranges for energy-optimal operation, e.g., Hz for internal timer [1], kHz for global clock [2], and MHz for fast data transmission or intensive signal processing [3]. However, free-running oscillators are seriously affected by process variations and should be readjusted by post-fabrication trimming. Though a crystal gives a stable frequency, the use of multiple crystals is generally not allowed by limited form-factor and increased cost. Instead, frequency multiplication from one clean reference is more effective way for higher frequency generation. Considering high-frequency clock is only intermittently used in sensor applications, the clock multiplier should provide a fast settling when turned on as well as low-power dissipation. This paper presents a 423nW, 3.2 MHz all-digital multiplying DLL (MDLL) with a digitally controlled leakage-based oscillator (DCLO) and a fast frequency relocking scheme adaptive to the amount of frequency drift during sleep state, which is required for intermittent operation of sensor node platforms.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487694","","Capacitance;Clocks;Frequency measurement;Logic gates;Oscillators;Solid state circuits;Temperature measurement","delay lock loops;frequency multipliers;low-power electronics;oscillators;wireless sensor networks","DCLO;MDLL;all-digital multiplying DLL;clock management unit;clock multiplier;digitally controlled leakage-based oscillator;fast frequency relocking scheme;frequency 3.2 MHz;frequency drift;frequency generation;frequency multiplication;global clock;high-frequency clock;low-power dissipation;multiple crystals;nanowatt design;post-fabrication trimming;power 423 mW;sensor node platforms;signal processing;ultralow-power wireless sensor platform;voltage 0.45 V","","1","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the processors adopt a single classifier rather than multiple classifiers even though multi-classifier systems (MCSs) offer more accurate recognition with higher robustness [4]. In addition, MCSs can incorporate the human vision system (HVS) recognition architecture to reduce computational requirements and enhance recognition accuracy. For example, HMAX models the exact hierarchical architecture of the HVS for improved recognition accuracy [5]. Compared with SIFT, known to have the best recognition accuracy based on local features extracted from the object [6], HMAX can recognize an object based on global features by template matching and a maximum-pooling operation without feature segmentation. In this paper we present a multi-classifier many-core processor combining the HMAX and SIFT approaches on a single chip. Through the combined approach, the system can: 1) pay attention to the target object directly with global context consideration, including complicated background or camouflaging obstacles, 2) utilize the super-resolution algorithm to recognize highly blurred or small size objects, and 3) recognize more than 200 objects in real-time by context-aware feature matching.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487685","","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Engines;Feature extraction;Object recognition;Program processors;Real-time systems","feature extraction;image matching;image resolution;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;object recognition","HMAX models;HVS recognition architecture;MCS;SIFT approaches;UAV;autonomic vehicle navigation;camouflaging obstacles;context-aware feature matching;hierarchical architecture;human vision system;maximum-pooling operation;multiclassifier many-core processor;multiclassifier systems;object recognition processors;small size object recognition;smart surveillance;super-resolution recognition algorithm;template matching;unmanned air vehicles","","9","","9","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the advantages of TI structures, power consumption is increased due to the stricter matching requirements between channels; in some cases, >50% of total power is for calibration purposes. Thus, to realize high-speed and high-resolution ADCs with TI structures, it is important to alleviate the calibration burden by choosing a suitable number of power-efficient high-speed single channels. Previously reported CDAC-based 2b/cycle structures made contributions in realizing high-speed single-channel ADCs with high resolution by using additional capacitive DACs and modified switching logic. The power overhead and the complexity of the additional logic and DACs for 2b/cycle implementations have been of trivial concern for low resolution ADCs. However, as resolution increases, the complexity of such circuits becomes considerable, with power taking up a big share of the total. In this paper, a multi-step hardware-retirement (MSHR) technique, which disables low-accuracy hardware blocks of scaled sizes with the requirement relaxations from redundancies in an advancement to the reconfiguration scheme in the work of Kong et al. (2013), is reported to alleviate the overhead of additional logic and DACs for ADCs, requiring high resolutions.
