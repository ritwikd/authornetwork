In response to an inquiry on this misconduct, Mr. Maxim acknowledged that the following people who have been listed as co-authors on several of his papers are fabricated names and that he is the only author:<BR><BR>C. Turinici, D. Smith, S. Dupue, M. Gheorge, R. Johns, D. Antrik<BR><BR>Additionally, in papers by Mr. Maxim that have co-authors other than those listed above, it was discovered in some cases that he had not consulted with them while writing the papers, and submitted papers without their knowledge.<BR><BR>Although Mr. Maxim maintains that not all of the data is falsified, IEEE nevertheless cannot assure the integrity of papers posted by him because of his repeated false statements.<BR><BR>Due to the nature of this violation, reasonable effort should be made to remove all past references to the above paper, and to refrain from any future references.An active clock-deskewing PLL uses analog-phase interpolation to generate the local shifted clocks. It provides a uniform and process independent phase-step over the entire deskew range, and a zero-latency phase shift to speed-up the deskewing process. This 400x800μm/sup 2/ PLL is fabricated in a 0.15μm CMOS process having a frequency range of 160 to 2550MHz, phase step of 2.8°, RMS jitter <1 % T/sub osc/ and draws 60mW from a 1.5V supply.","0193-6530","0-7803-8267-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2004.1332736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332736","","CMOS analog integrated circuits;CMOS process;Frequency;Interpolation;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Solid state circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;clocks;interpolation;phase locked loops;timing jitter","1.5 V;160 to 2550 MHz;60 mW;CMOS process;RMS jitter;active clock-deskewing PLL;analog phase interpolation;local shifted clocks;process independent phase-step;ring oscillator;zero-latency phase shift","","2","1","","","","15-19 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2004 IEEE International","20040913","2004","","","25","31 Vol.1","In three decades, the IC industry grew from nothing to current GSI levels (with 10<sup>9</sup> devices on a chip). Its major driving force has been the use of device scaling, which has been especially effective in enhancing the performance of digital chips. However, increasingly, diverse system applications have created an additional driving force - the development of more and more system chips with an increased need to integrate more diverse functionality (digital, analog, memory, RF, etc.) within a limited form factor. In addition to current SoCs on a 2D die, a trend for the coming decade is multidimensional die integration on interconnected substrates in a compact package. Correspondingly, a metric analyzing technology trends is presented. At the same time, beyond the innovative foundry/fabless business structure of the 1990s, new business models are evolving for the realization of system chips. Such models, leading to an effective solution called virtual vertical integration, is discussed. System-chip development must also be vertically integrated to achieve optimized performance, but advanced technologies required to realize such integration cover various horizontal segments of knowledge, such as multidimensional-die architecture design, circuit design, and related design automation, as well as novel testing and packaging techniques, leading-edge device and wafer-fabrication technologies, and solution-oriented software coding. In this regard, critical challenges are highlighted in terms of power partitioning, integrated design, and built-in quality assurance for known-good-die, signal integrity in field applications, and technology optimization across different segments. The parallelism of technology solutions with business models, and their conjoined optimization in the coming system-chip era, is illustrated in this paper.","0193-6530","0-7803-8267-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2004.1332580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332580","","Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computer architecture;Design optimization;Foundries;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Multidimensional systems;Packaging;Radio frequency","circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit technology;integrated memory circuits;quality control;radiofrequency integrated circuits;reviews;system-on-chip","GSI;IC industry;RF functionality;SoC;analog functionality;built-in quality assurance;business models;circuit design;compact package;design automation;device fabrication technologies;device scaling;digital chips;digital functionality;form factor;foundry-fabless business structure;gigascale integration;integrated design;integrated functionality;interconnected substrates;known-good-die;memory functionality;multidimensional die integration;multidimensional-die architecture design;optimized performance;packaging techniques;power partitioning;signal integrity;solution-oriented software coding;system applications;system chips;system-chip development;technology optimization;technology segments;technology trend metric;testing;virtual vertical integration;wafer-fabrication technologies","","1","","","","","15-19 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2004 IEEE International","20040913","2004","","","32","37 Vol.1","The trend in handheld devices is toward smaller multifunctional terminals with continuously-improving end-user satisfaction. In addition to being difficult to fulfill separately, the different requirements are often contradictory. This statement applies especially well in the case of cellular phones. The speed of their development has been unequalled, while delivery volumes have grown all the time, being now over 400 million per annum. The high level of integration and other technical challenges make the cellular phone an ideal example of an embedded communications system with tough requirements. In this paper, technologies needed to assemble a cellular phone are studied from different angles. Overall power consumption is one of the key performance indicators. This translates to concern, both for power-amplifier and DSP efficiency in the talk mode, and for various leakage currents in analog and digital receiver circuits in the standby mode. The emerging multimedia capabilities call for better displays and enhanced audio performance. The increasing amount of software needed sets wholly new requirements for the processing power and memory size of the device. Third-generation cellular standards support high data rates, and are based on the most recent advances in the telecommunications sphere. Packet-switched traffic and Internet protocols are growing in importance, whereas other more-traditional radio interfaces are integrated into cellular phones to form multi-radio devices. Evidently, the power consumption is affected simultaneously. In this review paper, the cellular phone is analyzed as an embedded system from the integration, performance, and power-consumption angles. We discuss the following key issues concerning cellular phones: terminal trends and their impact on power economy; radio technologies and multiradio concepts; technological implementations; integration challenges; related solid-state-circuit research-and-development expectations.","0193-6530","0-7803-8267-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2004.1332581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332581","","Assembly;Auditory displays;Cellular phones;Circuits;Digital signal processing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Handheld computers;Leakage current;Telecommunication standards","3G mobile communication;Internet;cellular radio;digital signal processing chips;display devices;embedded systems;leakage currents;low-power electronics;mobile handsets;packet switching;power amplifiers;radio receivers;reviews;telecommunication standards","DSP efficiency;Internet protocols;analog receiver circuits;audio performance;cellular phone technologies;cellular phones;data rates;delivery volumes;digital receiver circuits;embedded communications system;embedded systems;end-user satisfaction;handheld devices;high level integration;integration challenges;leakage currents;memory size;multi-radio devices;multifunctional terminals;multimedia capabilities;packet-switched traffic;performance indicators;phone displays;phone software;power consumption;power-amplifier efficiency;processing power;radio interfaces;solid-state-circuit research-and-development;talk mode;technical challenges;terminal trends;third-generation cellular standards","","31","","","","","15-19 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090305","2008","","","524","633","A wake-up receiver (WuRx) is used in wireless sensor networks (WSN) to detect wireless traffic directed to a node's receiver and activate it upon detection, improving network latency and energy dissipation by maximizing data transceiver sleep time. The always-on nature of the WuRx sets a power dissipation floor for the entire system. In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2002 IEEE International","20020807","2002","1","","24","27 vol.1","Information technology (IT) emerged from the 1970s based on main-frame computers. Since then, PCs and the Internet world have drastically expanded the IT industry along with rapid growth of network and communication technology. For almost all platforms, semiconductor memories have been a key enabling technology. In the PC era, DRAM density increase has been driven by rapid expansion of applications with advanced operating systems. In the future, servers will continue driving high-density DRAM requirements, and the maximum memory size of servers will be one of the key performance parameters. 512 Mb DRAM will be widely available in 2002 and 16 Gb DRAM is expected to appear within the next 10 years. Performance of semiconductor memories will be driven by graphics applications and network systems. 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be popular in 2002 and 2 Gb/s/pin in 2004 for high-end graphics applications. Random-access times in the range of 5 ns for SRAM and 20 ns for DRAM range and 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be available in 2002, and even faster (frequency, latency) memories will be required for high-end network systems such as OC-768-based switches and routers and beyond. Mobile platforms, especially 3 G phones and PDAs, are driving low-voltage low-power memories. Standby power of DRAM and pseudo-SRAM has been reduced drastically over the last 2 years. 1.8 V DRAM will be in volume production in 2002 and 1.0 V DRAM is expected in 2005 for longer battery life and moving-picture capability of mobile applications. The small-form-factor requirement of mobile phones and consumer applications such as PDA, and DSC will expedite various multi-chip-package solutions such as SRAM+Flash, DRAM+Flash, and SRAM+DRAM+Flash. Recent digital convergence and the rapid reduction of $/MB of mass storage flash memory increased the usage of flash memory in various mobile and consumer applications. Semiconductor memory will continue to follow Moore's Law for at least the next 10 years and will be lead by ma- s storage flash memory technology. Memory requirement of various IT platforms will continue to increase the trend of MB/system and MB/person.","","0-7803-7335-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2002.992921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992921","","Batteries;Communication industry;Flash memory;Graphics;IP networks;Information technology;Network servers;Personal communication networks;Random access memory;Semiconductor memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;application specific integrated circuits;flash memories;information technology;integrated circuit economics;integrated circuit packaging;mobile radio;technological forecasting","3 G phones;DRAM;IT users;PDA;SRAM;battery life;customization;efficiency;flash memories;memory bit cost;memory business;mobile applications;mobile phones;packaging;semiconductor memories;small-form-factor requirement","","9","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2002","03 Feb 2002-07 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since typical usage patterns usually run at nominal Vcc and temperature, these infrequent dynamic variations severely limit FCLK. The concept of timing-error detection and correction in previous work by Ernst, D., et al, (2003) is extended and implemented in a test-chip in 65nm CMOS in Bai, P., et al, (2004) to explore the effectiveness of resilient circuits in eliminating Vcc and temperature FCLK guardbands as well as exploiting path-activation probabilities to maximize throughput (TP).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523227","","Clocks;Delay;Energy efficiency;Error analysis;Gain measurement;Metastasis;Pipelines;Solid state circuits;Temperature distribution;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;clocks;error detection;microprocessor chips;timing circuits","CMOS;dynamic-variation tolerance;infrequent dynamic variations;instruction-replay-based recovery circuits;metastability-immune timing-error detection;microprocessor clock frequency;path-activation probability;resilient circuits;supply voltage droop;test-chip","","27","7","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An 800MHz -122dBc/Hz-at-200kHz Clock Multiplier based on a Combination of PLL and Recirculating DLL","Gierkink, S.","Conexant Syst., Red Bank, NJ","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008. ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","454","627","DLL clock multipliers outperform their PLL counterparts in terms of phase noise because they have significantly less jitter accumulation [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"15.3 A 115dB-DR audio DAC with −61dBFS out-of-band noise","Westerveld, H.; Schinkel, D.; van Tuijl, E.","Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","Out-of-band noise (OBN) is troublesome in analog circuits that process the output of a noise-shaping audio DAC. It causes slewing in amplifiers and aliasing in sampling circuits like ADCs and class-D amplifiers. Nonlinearity in these circuits also causes cross-modulation of the OBN into the audio band. These mechanisms lead to a higher noise level and more distortion in the audio band. OBN also leads to interference in the LF and MF band, compromising e.g. AM radio reception. To avoid these problems, it is desired to reduce OBN power to below -60dBFS. An active low-pass filter after the DAC output can reduce the OBN power to acceptable levels, but this solution is expensive in terms of power consumption and chip area. A FIR-DAC approach implements a 1b PWM modulator, followed by a semi-digital low-pass FIR reconstruction filter. It achieves high-end audio performance with sufficiently low OBN, but the FIR structure costs area, adds latency, and (like an analog low-pass filter) inherently limits the maximum output signal frequency. Multi-bit noise shapers employ smaller quantization steps and therefore output lower OBN. A cascaded-modulator architecture can directly be followed by an on-chip amplifier without low-pass filtering. However, with only 330 quantization levels, it still cannot achieve the desired -60dBFS OBN without additional filtering. Moreover, this approach requires complex dynamic-element matching (DEM) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) shaping mechanisms. The paper present an approach that reduces OBN to below -60dBFS with minimal increase in power and area consumption. It consists of two paths . The main path is based on the work of van Tuijl et al. (2004), containing a 128× oversampled 5b 3rd-order noise shaper, thermometer decoder and real-time DEM algorithm followed by a current DAC. Since the digital noise shaper generates negligible in-band noise products, the error signal of the noise shaper is practically equal to the OBN. This err- r signal is integrated (as part of the loop filter), quantized and fed to a correction path with a differentiating DAC (DIFF-DAC). This DAC inverts the integration action, obtaining unity signal transfer. The output currents of both paths are subtracted, reducing OBN significantly. Quantization noise of the correction path is shaped because the error signal is differentiated after quantization. Depending on the shape of the noise transfer function of the main DAC, the DIFF-DAC needs an over-range in order to accommodate the increased signal swing caused by the integration action. Still, area and power cost is minimal because the range of the DIFF-DAC is still only a fraction of the main DAC range.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063033","","1f noise;Finite impulse response filters;Quantization (signal);Real-time systems;Transfer functions","audio equipment;digital-analogue conversion;intersymbol interference;low-power electronics;quantisation (signal);signal denoising","DIFF-DAC;digital noise shaper;error signal;integration action inversion;intersymbol interference;loop filter;noise correction path;noise shaping audio DAC;out-of-band noise;oversampled third order noise shaper;quantization noise;real-time DEM algorithm;signal differentiation;signal quantization;thermometer decoder;unity signal transfer","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","512","632","Resonant clocking techniques show promise in reducing global clock power and timing uncertainty (skew and jitter). By resonating the large global clock capacitance with an inductance, the energy used to charge the clock node each period can be recycled within the LC tank network, resulting in lower clock power. Additional power savings are realized by reducing the strength of clock drivers because only losses need to be overcome at resonance. Skew and jitter are improved due to the bandpass characteristic of the LC network and the use of fewer clock buffering stages. We describe how the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE) processor is experimentally transformed to have a resonant-load global clock distribution similar to the one in (Chan et al., 2004).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523282","","Capacitors;Clocks;Frequency;Inductors;Jitter;Power measurement;Resonance;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing;Voltage","clocks;microprocessor chips","LC tank network;bandpass characteristic;cell broadband-engine processor;clock buffering stages;clock drivers;clock node;global clock power;large global clock capacitance;resonant clocking techniques;resonant global clock distribution;timing uncertainty","","5","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
