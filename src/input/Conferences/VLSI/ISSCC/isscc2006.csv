Traditionally, these needs have been satisfied by the increase in transistor density and performance, as suggested by 'Moore's Law"" and guided by CMOS scaling theory. As the silicon industry moves towards the 45nm node and beyond, the two most important challenges cited are the growing standby power dissipation and the increasing variability in device characteristics. These complaints are cited as the reason Moore's Law is ""broken"", or why CMOS scaling is coming to an end. Actually, these effects are the embodiments of CMOS technology's approach to atomistic and quantum-mechanical physics boundaries. However, the infusion of new materials and device structures will extend the development lifetime of silicon CMOS by at least ten years.

A ceramic Pb(,ZrTi)O<sub>3 </sub> film with average crystallite diameter below 20nm has a high electro-optical coefficient (>150pm/V) suitable for on-chip modulators. This paper introduces a new approach for realizing high-speed optical interconnects on silicon chips.

IEEE International","20060918","2006","","","21","39","The seemingly never-ending advancement of silicon technology has resulted in the emergence of mobile broadband communication systems for voice, data and video transmission with good connectivity and proper quality-of-service. Devices are being fabricated using processes managed at atomic levels, while IC design involves detailed systems engineering, including the incorporation of application content. Data-rate and mobility tradeoffs and different standards like 2G, 3G, Bluetooth, WLAN, GPS and digital-video broadcasting, are leading to multimode requirements and topics such as the coexistence of different technologies must be solved. Beyond all of that, secure data transfer using security checks like encryption is most important for the networked world. All of these various topics are, finally, the reason for the appearance of challenging architectural requirements, such as architectural re-configurability and programmability, motivated by the growing importance of multimode and multistandard solutions. While parameters such as data-rate and algorithmic- and circuit-complexity have changed approximately exponentially with time, there has not been much improvement in the battery capacity. For this reason key considerations for mobile products are energy management and power reduction. In this context, the introduction of platform concepts, including analog and RF at the most practical cost, power-levels and form-factors, are key requirements for system-on-chip and system-in-package solutions for current and future mobile multimedia terminals. This talk will explore current multi-million-transistor ICs with multi-billion operations per second of signal processing, along with analog and RF capabilities for mobile multimedia communications. It will also consider special requirements on wafer processes such as leakage and analog and RF capabilities, and will look at how R&D engineers bridge the world of system-level design, silicon and software.

IEEE International","20060918","2006","","","40","56","There are two elements in real-timeliness that a human being can intuitively sense. One is the continuity of motion that a human being can cognitively feel to be natural, and the other is response time between action and reaction. Correspondingly, of the applications that have advanced the concept of real-time computing is computer entertainment systems which originally started as computer games. Real-timeliness of computer entertainment systems must be quick enough to match the speed of the response time of the player. Lack of both processing power and data-transfer rate in achieving this level of real-timeliness using general-purpose microprocessors have motivated the development of a new breed of more-powerful processors built on a new architecture. In computer entertainment systems, since the hardware is normally fixed for several years, once its specifications are determined, there is an inclination to seek the most-advanced technology within the future roadmap, typically that of three years ahead, and one generation ahead in the semiconductor-fabrication process. As a consequence, a system must start off by utilizing large-size chipsets at launch, but, during its life cycle, it goes through two generations of semiconductor fabrication processes for downsizing, as well as progressive integration of chips to reduce manufacturing costs, and to enable mass production. Today, more than 40 million computer entertainment systems are shipped in a year, and are becoming a strong leading power in spearheading advancement in semiconductor technology and in creating demand.

The demand for cost-and power-consumption reduction of RF tuners is very high. In particular, RF tuners consume over 80% of the overall power consumption of an ISDB-T 1-segment receiver, which is composed of RF tuner and digital demodulator. In this paper, a ISDB-T 1-segment RF tuner with low noise figure and high adjacent-channel rejection (ACR) is described.

Blocker filtering, fine variable-gain amplification and variable-BW channel selection are moved to the digital baseband. The SNR is optimized as a function of signal and out-of-band blocker power in Behbahani, F. et al, (2001) by reconfiguring the modulator order into one of 4 modes at constant fs, thereby keeping anti-aliasing unchanged. A 5b flash ADC integrated in the converter is the front end of a simple spectrum analyzer (SSA).

With a subretinal light sensitive chip, the natural optical system of the eye is still used, allowing the patient to intuitively locate objects. The patient was 1 out of 7, who have been implanted in a clinical study in 2006 in Tuebingen, Germany (E. Zrenner et al., 2007). The space beneath the retina is limited. Either just an electrode array is placed there (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), or a silicon chip thinned to about 70mum, or both. The experiments (E. Zrenner et al., 2007) used a device including a light-sensitive CMOS chip and separate direct stimulation electrodes. The device was connected to an external power supply by a polyimide-ribbon (comparable to (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), however much longer), forming a flexible connection into the eyeball. Feasibility of the wired supply approach for humans was proven; no perception of the ribbon was reported by the patients.

We named the sensor ""ISIS-V2"", for In-situ Storage Image Sensor Version 2.103 memory elements are attached to every pixel; generated image signals were instantly and continuously stored in the in-situ storage without being read out of the sensor. The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side. The CCM is a CCD-specific efficient signal-amplification device. CCM, combined with the BSI structure and cooling, achieved very high sensitivity. The ISIS-V12 was a test sensor intended to prove the technical feasibility of the structure. The maximum frame rate was 250kfps for a charge-handling capacity of Q<sub>max</sub>=10,000e and 1Mfps for a reduced Q<sub>max</sub>. The pixel count was 489x400 pixels. For backside-illuminated (BSI) image sensors, metal wires can be placed on the front surface to increase the frame rate without reducing fill factor or violating uniformity of the pixel configuration. It has been proved by simulations that 100Mfps is achievable by introducing innovative technologies including a special wiring method.

This is a 41% improvement in Gb/mm<sup>2</sup> and a 20% gain in overall die-size.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523279","","Atherosclerosis;Circuit noise;Clocks;Decoding;Noise reduction;Nonvolatile memory;Resistors;Routing;Variable structure systems;Voltage","NAND circuits;flash memories","NAND flash memory;memory arrays;memory size 16 GByte;sense amplifiers;size 56 nm;word length 3 bit;write rate performance","","5","","2","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver with modal-dispersion equalizer for 10Gb/s 500m MMF transmission","Watanabe, D.; Ono, A.; Okayasu, T.","Advantest, Gunma, Japan","Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers, 2009. ISSCC 2009. IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","106","107,107a","Data communication over 300 m of distance, such as Ethernet standards, where the required data rate per channel reaches 10 Gb/s or more, demand optical transmission. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and multimode optical fiber (MMF) are usually used in such optical transmission systems, because they offer several advantages such as ease of assembly and optical alignment for cost reduction. The modulation frequency of commercial VCSEL devices is limited to approximately 10 GHz. To overcome this limitation, solutions have been reported by Palermo et al. (2006, 2007). However, these papers merely describe that the modulation frequency of VCSEL can be extended by equalization. On the other hand, the transmission performance of MMF is generally defined by the product of transmission distance and modulation frequency. In a commercial graded-index (Gl) MMF, the transmission performance stays about 500 MHz-km due to modal dispersion. In the case of 10 Gb/s data transmission, the required bandwidth for transmission medium is 10 GHz or more. Therefore, when using these commercial Gl MMF, the transmission distance will be limited to 50 m. Thus, when several hundred meters of transmission is achieved using MMF, the modal dispersion of MMF becomes a rather predominant transmission bottleneck than the use of VCSEL. To overcome this bottleneck, a 4-PAM VCSEL driver with an equalization scheme to compensate the modal dispersion of MMF is described in this paper. The driver is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS and achives 10 Gb/s 500 m 4-PAM transmission using conventional MMF having a 500 MHz-km of transmission bandwidth. Using this driver, the transmission distance with 10 Gb/s is extended by 10times (5 GHz-km).","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977330","","Bandwidth;Communication standards;Data communication;Equalizers;Ethernet networks;Fiber lasers;Frequency modulation;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical modulation;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","CMOS integrated circuits;data communication equipment;driver circuits;equalisers;gradient index optics;integrated optoelectronics;optical fibre communication;optical fibre dispersion;optical modulation;pulse amplitude modulation;surface emitting lasers","CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver fabrication;MMF transmission;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;data communication;data transmission;distance 500 m;equalization scheme;graded-index MMF;modal dispersion;modal-dispersion equalizer;multimode optical fiber;optical transmission system;pulse amplitude modulation;size 90 nm;vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser","","2","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increasingly, performance is a differentiating factor and is also a way of creating new markets or expanding existing markets. While conventional memory uses, for actual operations, every other cell along a selected word line (WL) (Takeuchi, 2006), this design simultaneously exercises them all. A performance improvement of at least 100% is derived from this all-bitline (ABL) architecture relative to conventional chips. Additional techniques push performance to even higher levels.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523236","","Circuits;Decoding;Diodes;Latches;Logic;MOS devices;MOSFETs;Nonvolatile memory;Switches;Voltage","NAND circuits;flash memories;memory architecture","ABL architecture;MLC NAND;NAND flash;all-bitline architecture;bit rate 34 Mbit/s;size 56 nm;word line","","5","3","2","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A CR system seeks to use the unoccupied spectrum segments by sensing the spectrum before transmitting to preserve the rights of privileged primary users (Haykin, 2006). IEEE 802.22 is the working group on wireless regional area network (WRAN) for the license-exempt use of the U.S. TV broadcasting band. Such use requires that new transceivers possess CR functionality. A fully-integrated CMOS receiver is presented with a CR spectrum-sensing functionality of arbitrary detection bandwidth over the UHF band. This capability is called multi-resolution spectrum sensing (MRSS).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523289","","","CMOS integrated circuits;IEEE standards;cognitive radio;radio receivers;television broadcasting","CMOS receiver;IEEE 802.22;UHF receiver;USA TV broadcasting band;cognitive radio;multiresolution spectrum sensing;unoccupied spectrum segments;wireless regional area network","","4","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
