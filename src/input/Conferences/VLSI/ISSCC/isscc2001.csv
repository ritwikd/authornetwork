Hartley and Weaver image reject architectures partially resolve this issue at the cost of requiring precise phase and gain matching in both the signal path and the local oscillator (LO) path. The use of polyphase filters to improve the matching typically leads to a high power dissipation whereas analog calibration mandates periodic refreshing, a difficult issue in CDMA systems that must receive continuously. In this Weaver receiver, gain and phase mismatches are calibrated simultaneously by a least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm.

ISSCC. 2001 IEEE International","20020807","2001","","","370","371","In recent years, the design of CMOS RF oscillators at ever-higher frequencies has gained interest. The driving force for this evolution is the wireless market that evolves towards standards implementing higher bandwidths at higher frequency bands. This paper demonstrates that electronic systems adhering to future portable wireless as well as fixed-point wireless communication standards come within the grasp of standard CMOS technology. For this design, full optimization of all VCO building blocks is necessary, because in this design the inductor is no longer the sole and dominant source of phase noise and power loss. The optimized LC-tank and gain cell for the VCO-topology is obtained using an in-house design tool. The on-chip inductor utilizes all 4 available metal layers. The voltage-variable capacitance is realized by a varactor diode. In the global optimization, all contributions to phase noise and power loss of inductor, gain cell and diode cell are taken into account. Special attention is given to a high layout-symmetry in both floorplan and building blocks, to avoid the introduction of any additional asymmetry in the oscillation waveform. This design is in a standard CMOS 0.25 μm technology with 4 Al metal layers and 15 Ωcm substrate. The oscillator operates from 16.25 GHz to 17.715 GHz, when the control voltage is swept from 0.64 V to 1.4 V. This corresponds to a tuning range of 8.6% with a 16.98 GHz center frequency.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912678","","Bandwidth;CMOS technology;Communication standards;Design optimization;Diodes;Inductors;Phase noise;Radio frequency;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wireless communication","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;circuit optimisation;circuit tuning;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;phase noise;varactors;voltage-controlled oscillators","0.25 micron;0.64 to 1.4 V;16.25 to 17.715 GHz;17 GHz;Al;Al metal layers;CMOS RF oscillators;CMOS VCO;CMOS technology;SHF;VCO building blocks;gain cell;global optimization;high layout-symmetry;onchip inductor;optimization;optimized LC-tank;phase noise;power loss;tuning range;varactor diode;voltage-variable capacitance","","19","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is accomplished by averaging the charge injected by the proportional path over an entire input update period. As a consequence, the ICO control current has a shape characterized by a staircase of low amplitude steps, versus one characterized by narrow high amplitude pulses, and needs much less filtering for low-jitter operation.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912689","","Bandwidth;CMOS process;Capacitance;Charge pumps;Filters;Frequency;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Photonic band gap;Voltage","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;jitter;phase locked loops","0.18 micron;125 to 1250 MHz;CMOS PLL;high amplitude pulses;input phase difference;input update period;low amplitude steps;low-jitter operation;proportional path;sample-reset loop filter","","6","3","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For every incoming data byte, the trellis encoder outputs four PAM-5 symbols to four pairs of wires at 125 MBaud/s. The trellis code has an eight-state radix-4 trellis, it provides 6 dB coding gain for an ISI free channel. In practice, the gain could be less than 6 dB due to the ISI. Signals are transmitted on both directions on each of the four wires, therefore, echo must be removed on each wire.

As CMOS technology progresses to deep submicron, however, the possibilities of integrating next-generation broadband communication transceivers of high bit-rate on a single chip using this low-cost technology are investigated. In so doing, one of the first questions is that whether a quality signal source or, more preferably, a VCO can be designed in such a technology. This work demonstrates the feasibility of an LC-resonator based VCO in 0.25 μm CMOS for operation at 50 GHz consuming less power than its counterparts in other technologies while providing comparable phase noise and tuning performance.

Therefore, they have fundamentally lower power dissipation than wide-band dividers. Due to their narrow-band nature, ILFDs work in a limited frequency range (locking range). In this paper, shunt-peaking is used as an approach to increase the locking range and lower the power dissipation at higher frequencies.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912698","","Energy loss;Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;Inductors;Narrowband;Power dissipation;Power measurement;Tail;Voltage;Wideband","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;frequency dividers","0.35 micron;0.5 mW;19 GHz;CMOS narrow-band injection-locked frequency divider;frequency synthesizer;locking range;power dissipation;quality factor;resonator;shunt peaking","","51","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2001 IEEE International","20020807","2001","","","374","375","With the increasing number of mobile communication standards, a large research effort is put into the task of complete integration of RF voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) for multi-band and multi-mode direct conversion transceivers. However, RF VCOs are, at present, not fully integrated in transceivers, since they suffer from poor phase noise and fabrication tolerances. Satisfying the phase noise requirements of GSM, IS-136, or UMTS is a major challenge for fully-integrated VCOs. Traditionally, (integrated) RF VCOs are realized with bipolar devices due to their low high-frequency noise and low flicker noise corner frequency. Recently, several publications on CMOS VCOs have appeared, reporting excellent phase noise performance at large frequency offsets. These VCOs, however, suffer from degraded close-to-carrier phase noise due to the high flicker noise of the CMOS devices, and from a low-resistive substrate allowing only low-Q spiral inductors and resulting in higher power consumption. Furthermore, many of the VCOs have nonlinear tuning characteristics because of the abrupt C-V curve of the MOS diode. This wideband BiCMOS VCO for multimode direct conversion transceivers achieves low phase noise both close to the carrier and at large frequency offsets. In addition the VCO must have a wide but sufficiently linear tuning characteristic and low pushing sensitivity. The design must provide sufficient performance margin for production tolerances.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912680","","1f noise;3G mobile communication;BiCMOS integrated circuits;GSM;Phase noise;Radio frequency;Transceivers;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wideband","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;UHF oscillators;cellular radio;circuit tuning;integrated circuit noise;phase noise;radio receivers;voltage-controlled oscillators","0.3 to 2.5 V;1.75 to 2.51 GHz;GSM receivers;IS-136;RF VCOs;RF voltage-controlled oscillators;UMTS receivers;direct conversion receivers;linear tuning characteristic;low phase noise;mobile communication;multimode direct conversion transceivers;phase noise performance;production tolerances;wideband BiCMOS VCO","","20","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For cost reduction, a fully-integrated image-rejecting receiver, i.e. one for which off-chip filters are not required, is a desirable target. A double-quadrature downconverter is usually used to provide sufficient image rejection because the signal is transformed so that gain mismatches and phase errors in the converter inputs are reduced to second-order at the converter outputs. However, the double-quadrature architecture consumes much power because six mixers are used. In spite of its single-quadrature architecture, this 2 GHz receiver suppresses phase errors in LO signals and achieves 49 dB image rejection without trimming.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912641","","Costs;Filters;Image converters;Impedance matching;Inductors;Noise figure;Power supplies;RF signals;Resonant frequency;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;SIMOX;UHF integrated circuits;low-power electronics;radio receivers","1 V;12 mW;2 GHz;CMOS/SIMOX receiver;LC-tuned folded mixer;image rejection;low-power operation;single-quadrature architecture","","3","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, these applications require a reduction of design turn-around time (TAT) for the various specifications, as well as lower-voltage operation. Conventional eDRAM is generated by placement of hardware macros that are designed beforehand. The hardware macro restricts eDRAM specifications, and many hardware macros are necessary to support the demands of different customers. An eDRAM architecture that provides only the interface component as a software macro, i.e., hardware description language (HDL), has been recently reported. However, in this architecture, adjusting of control signal delays and differing control circuits are necessary for each memory configuration. The architecture reported here provides reduction of design TAT, more than 120 k eDRAM configurations, 1.2 V (100 MHz) to 1.8 V (200 MHz) operation, and a flexible interface. In addition, an enhanced on-chip tester tests the various eDRAM macros, reducing test time to 1/64 with a simultaneous 512 b I/O pass/failjudgment, and performs repair analysis at speed testing conditions.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912686","","Bandwidth;Circuit testing;Computer architecture;Control systems;Delay;Graphics;Hardware design languages;Performance evaluation;Power system management;Random access memory","DRAM chips;high-speed integrated circuits;integrated circuit testing;low-power electronics;random-access storage","1.2 to 1.8 V;100 to 200 MHz;120 kbit;auto signal management;design turn-around time reduction;embedded DRAM hybrid macro;onchip tester;repair analysis","","9","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This specification becomes more severe since for the ADSL standard Discrete Multi Tone (DMT) modulation is chosen. DMT signals have a high crest factor (CF=V/sub max//V/sub min/) and demand a highly-linear line driver. Since efficiency of a class AB line driver ideally is inverse proportional to the CF, the efficiency of this type of line driver is low in DMT-based applications. When implementing a line driver in a mainstream CMOS technology, decreasing supply voltage increases this problem, since a higher quiescent current is necessary to maintain the same distortion levels.

To provide means for system performance advancements and power management, there must be focus on all aspects of the computing platform-architecture, micro-architecture, bus memory, and I/O performance-much more than in the past. Multithreading and multi-core computer micro-architectures will increase both general-purpose and networking processor MIPS. Transaction-focused server processors will benefit from large on-die caches. Special-purpose architectures and circuit techniques will be required to deliver performance with higher efficiency. Future microprocessors will evolve as integration of DSP capabilities becomes imperative to enable such applications as media-rich communications, computer vision, and speech recognition. These advances in processing natural data will lead to a change in the computing paradigm from today's data-based, machine-based computing to tomorrow's knowledge-based, human-based computing. As the Internet becomes more integral to businesses and consumers, there will be new uses for and users of microprocessors. All this can be accomplished only with wired and wireless high-bandwidth Internet connectivity, driven by high-performance computer servers to fulfil the demand of computing in the Internet economy.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912412","","Computer networks;Energy management;Internet;Memory management;Microprocessors;Multithreading;Power system management;Pressing;System performance;Technological innovation","cache storage;computer architecture;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;multi-threading","DSP capabilities;I/O performance;bus memory;computing paradigm;media-rich communications;micro-architecture;microprocessor innovation;multi-core computer;multithreading;on-die caches;power issues;system performance;technology scaling;wireless high-bandwidth Internet connectivity","","45","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When multi-phase clocking is to be applied to larger die sizes or to multi-channel communications, however, it is extremely difficult to distribute the multi phase clock signals to distant local areas without generating inter-phase skew. To achieve a small area for clock distribution, the multi-phase clock generator reported here uses the delay compensation technique. Because this generator does not require a feedback loop, it is compact, adding only a small amount to chip area. Further, it produces accurate phase differences between multi-phase clock signals. Multi-clock generators of this type are applied to 2.5 GHz 4-phase clock distribution of an 8-channel receiver, fabricated with 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, and operating at 5 Gb/s.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912691","","CMOS technology;Clocks;Delay lines;Feedback loop;Frequency;National electric code;Page description languages;Phase locked loops;Signal generators;Space technology","CMOS digital integrated circuits;clocks","0.13 micron;2.5 GHz;5 Gbit/s;CMOS chip;clock distribution;delay compensation;multi-channel communication;multi-channel receiver;multi-phase clock generator;scalable architecture","","8","2","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 2001 IEEE International","20020807","2001","","","380","381","To cope with difficult device miniaturization in the multi-gigabit era, memory cells smaller than the traditional 8F/sup 2/ folded bitline (BL) cell are needed. A 6F/sup 2/ trench capacitor folded-BL cell has been recently described. However, it needs not only additional tight-pitch layers to create a vertically folded-BL arrangement, but also a vertical transistor. The 6F/sup 2/ open-BL cell enabling a simple planar transistor is another candidate as its inherently large imbalance noise between pairs of BLs is reduced. Low-voltage, high-speed array operation is essential in the multi-gigabit era. A conventional non-over-driven sensing scheme cannot achieve a high enough speed at an array voltage below 1.6 V, because the threshold voltage (Vth) cannot be reduced <0.1 V to obtain a low enough stand-by current. Distributed over-driven sensing enables a higher speed due to reduced voltage loss caused by distributed drivers combined with meshed power lines. Consequently, compared with the conventional schemes, the sensing time for a 1.2 V array voltage necessary for the 1 Gb generation decreased by 6.9 ns and 2.0 ns. Hence, this sensing scheme is promising for array voltages below 1.0 V in multi-gigabit memory. In multi-gigabit DRAMs, redundancy for degraded cells after packaging is a major concern. To overcome this a scheme is adopted which features a stacked flash fuse composed of three series flash fuses utilizing standard CMOS transistors without any additional process steps. Thus this technology can be used to fabricate a 0.13 μm 180 mm/sup 2/ 1 Gb DRAM assembled in a 400-mil package.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912682","","Assembly;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Capacitors;Degradation;Noise reduction;Packaging;Random access memory;Threshold voltage","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;high-speed integrated circuits;integrated circuit technology;memory architecture;redundancy","0.13 micron;1 Gbit;1.2 V;208 MHz;6F/sup 2/ open-bit-line cell;CMOS dynamic RAM;distributed over-driven sensing;high-speed array operation;low-voltage operation;memory cells;multi-gigabit DRAM technology;redundancy;stacked-flash fuse","","3","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For noise-immune power-stabilized operation, three circuit schemes suitable for the SDRAM are presented: (i) twisted open bitline (TOB) architecture; (ii) gain-controlled pre-sensing (GCP); and (iii) reference bitline calibration (RBC). The TOB scheme eliminates the coupling noise between adjacent BLs by holding neighboring bitlines stable at the reference voltage with the open readout and sensing using a reference BL from the adjacent block. The GCP scheme increases the sensing margin and speed by employing transconductance-matched pre-amplification. The RBC scheme actively mimics the cell data retention characteristics and yields an optimal voltage level for the reference BL from the charge-shared voltage from replica BL pairs.

ISSCC. 2001 IEEE International","20020807","2001","","","18","21","Driven by deregulation, a multitude of new transmission technologies have been deployed and standardized in recent years. The classical plain old telephony service (POTS) network is reused for DSL applications. Optical fiber is increasingly deployed in new networks, though its cost is still high. Air interface is used in sparsely-populated areas when deployment speed is needed. Although all these media intend to bring broadband to the home, they do it differently, using transmission principles which affect parameters such as line coding and equalization. They offer different bandwidths (less for twisted pair, highest for optical fiber) and differ in network topology (point-to-point or point-to-multi-point). Because of complex evolving standards, proposed architectures are at least partly based on programmable platforms consisting of DSPs, standard processors, and control memories. This approach is complemented by downloadable software. Design is dominated by analog aspects. Achieving transmitter performance with reasonable power consumption needs to be tackled by new structures for analog drivers, power amplifiers, ADCs, and DACs. Three families of access technology are discussed: DSL, best-known of the broadband technologies, outpacing the others in deployment speed; wireless in the local loop (WLL) and local multipoint distribution system (LMDS); and point-to-multipoint optical (PON) offering large bandwidth.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912409","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Costs;DSL;Digital signal processing;Network topology;Optical fibers;Optical transmitters;Passive optical networks;Telephony","broadband networks;digital subscriber lines;optical fibre networks;radio access networks","ADCs;DACs;DSL applications;air interface;bandwidths;broadband access;downloadable software;local multipoint distribution system;network topology;optical fiber;point-to-multipoint optical;power consumption;transmitter performance;wireless in the local loop","","6","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interconnect delay considerably degrades the performance of today's sophisticated microprocessors, so much work has been done to reduce both this delay and its influence on performance . In a chip multiprocessor, process scaling would improve the intrinsic speed of each processor tile, but overall chip speed would not increase because of the limits to communication between tiles. The communication performance is limited by not only RC-delay increase but also arising network congestion and contention. Regarding the latter, effective use is made of network techniques developed in both interconnection networks for off-chip multiprocessors and communication networks for packet switching. This elastic interconnect for internal communications on-chip multiprocessors is a fundamental technique capable of enhancing conventional network techniques by effectively utilizing on-chip repeater-inserted long wiring.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912667","","Communication networks;Degradation;Delay;Microprocessors;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network-on-a-chip;Packet switching;Repeaters;Tiles;Wiring","RC circuits;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips;repeaters;wiring","RC delay;elastic interconnects;interconnect delay;interconnection networks;internal communications;microprocessors;network congestion;overall chip speed;packet switching;process scaling;repeater-inserted long wiring","","9","4","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decreasing the supply voltage, V/sub DD/, is the easiest way to reduce power consumption in CMOS circuits because switching power is proportional to V/sub DD//sup 2/ for rail-to-rail logic swing. However, reducing V/sub DD/ degrades circuit speed due to the super-linear reduction of transistor current. Lowering transistor threshold voltage, V/sub th/, helps to recover this speed degradation; however sub-threshold leakage current increases exponentially with decreasing V/sub th/, resulting in battery-draining quiescent power consumption with V/sub th/ less than about 300 mV. Circuit techniques are needed to achieve lower power consumption without speed degradation. The low-power CMOS SOI circuit configuration reported here, low-swing charge recycling (LSCR), uses differential pass-transistor logic, a low voltage swing, and charge recycling to save power.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912654","","Adders;CMOS logic circuits;Degradation;Energy consumption;Frequency;Leakage current;Recycling;Switching circuits;Threshold voltage;Very large scale integration","CMOS logic circuits;adders;low-power electronics;silicon-on-insulator","VLSI design;differential pass-transistor logic;low-power CMOS SOI adder;low-swing charge recycling circuit;sub-threshold leakage current;transistor threshold voltage","","2","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2001","05 Feb 2001-07 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Blocker filtering, fine variable-gain amplification and variable-BW channel selection are moved to the digital baseband. The SNR is optimized as a function of signal and out-of-band blocker power in Behbahani, F. et al, (2001) by reconfiguring the modulator order into one of 4 modes at constant fs, thereby keeping anti-aliasing unchanged.

"ISSCC panel says “yes… maybe” to 100-day hardware","","","Solid-State Circuits Society Newsletter, IEEE","20130419","2001","6","4","5","5","A panel of experts gathered in San Francisco in February to ask, can 100 million transistors in a 100-square-millimeter die be designed in 100 days? And the answer was … maybe. The good news is that the notorious productivity gap is being closed by re-use and platform-based design, but only for digital and memory-intensive circuits, as industry is increasingly looking to integrate and re-use analog circuits. The gap exists between the slower growth in design productivity over manufacturing productivity, and analog circuits are proving resistant to design automation and still require — and get — much handcrafting. These were the observations of the panel of EDA and System-On-Chip experts gathered at International Solid-State Circuits Conference.","1098-4232","","","10.1109/N-SSC.2001.6499799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6499799","","","","","","0","","","","","Oct. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Internet Age is a direct result of the tremendous advances in solid-state circuits enjoyed over the last three decades. Its impact is revolutionary in terms of cost-effective delivery of new roducts and services. The convergence of wireless and wireline digital communications with advanced computing technologies enables new System On A Chip concepts, apparently limited only by the imagination of the designers.

"25.3 A VCO with implicit common-mode resonance","Murphy, D.; Darabi, H.; Hao Wu","Broadcom, Irvine, CA, USA","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","CMOS VCO performance metrics have not improved significantly over the last decade. Indeed, the best VCO Figure of Merit (FOM) currently reported was published by Hegazi back in 2001 [1]. That topology, shown in Fig. 25.3.1(a), employs a second resonant tank at the source terminals of the differential pair that is tuned to twice the LO frequency (F<sub>LO</sub>). The additional tank provides a high common-mode impedance at 2×F<sub>LO</sub>, which prevents the differential pair transistors from conducting in triode and thus prevents the degradation of the oscillator's quality factor (Q). As a consequence, the topology can achieve an oscillator noise factor (F)-defined as the ratio of the total oscillator noise to the noise contributed by the tank- of just below 2, which is equal to the fundamental limit of a cross-coupled LC CMOS oscillator [2]. There are, however, a few drawbacks of Hegazi's VCO: (1) the additional area required for the tail inductor, (2) the routing complexity demanded of the tail inductor, which can degrade its Q and limit its effectiveness, and (3) for oscillators with wide tuning ranges, the need to independently tune the second inductor, which again can degrade its Q. Moreover, it can be shown that the common-mode impedance of the main tank at 2×F<sub>LO</sub> also has a significant effect on the oscillator's performance, which if not properly modeled can lead to disagreement between simulation and measurement, particularly in terms of the flicker noise corner. To mitigate these issues, this work introduces a new oscillator topology that resonates the common-mode of the circuit at 2×F<sub>LO</sub>, but does not require an additional inductor.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063116","","1f noise;CMOS integrated circuits;Inductors;Phase noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;network topology;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS VCO;differential pair transistors;figure of merit;implicit common-mode resonance;oscillator noise factor;oscillator topology;tail inductor","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
