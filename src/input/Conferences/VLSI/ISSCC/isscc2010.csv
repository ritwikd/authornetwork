Yet not all work in this field is sci-fi, and engineers working with clinical researchers and scientists have realized several milestones in the treatment of chronic diseases. Perhaps the most successful example of a bionic system is the cochlear prosthesis, which has helped restore a measure of hearing in over 150,000 patients, so far. Another active field is neuromodulation, where neurostimulators targeting specific neural circuits are being applied as a therapy for a variety of diseases including Parkinson's disease, incontinence, and obsessive compulsive disorder.

While more specialization was an undisputed trend of the past, we are beginning to see hardware companies becoming less specialized - manufacturing companies entering design, design companies enter services to name a few. This change allows for larger fraction of the revenue pie to belong to one entity and perhaps even allowing for recurring revenue to a hardware company thus making economics sustainable. Before the supposed physical limits are reached, what is the right approach that will win and allow Moore's Law of economics to continue its self fulfilling prophecy?

"ES5: Can RF SoCs (Self)test their own RF?","Staszewski, R. Bogdan; Rudell, Jacques C.","Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2010 IEEE International","20100318","2010","","","530","531","RF testing is an increasingly critical component of modern RF SoC's. While digital logic and memory tests have all become largely automated and inexpensive through built-in self-test (BIST), testing for RF parameter compliance of a wireless standard is time consuming and commands a significant fraction of the total SoC cost. Due to the conventional need for large and expensive RF test equipment, these tests limit the SoC manufacturing throughput (about 3 million cell phones are manufactured per day!) and cannot accommodate other parts of SoC lifecycles, such as on-wafer testing. At the same time, the stakes are much higher in RF SoC's: A failing RF circuit means throwing away the perfectly working digital/memory section occupying most of the die. Recent publications have proposed to exploit the increasing abundance and intelligence of the on-die digital logic to test its RF part in order to reduce the complexity of external test equipment or even eliminate it entirely. With the external equipment bottleneck gone, massively- parallel tests of hundreds or thousands of IC chips can be carried out simultaneously, thus greatly reducing the average test time. Although it imposes limitations, the self-testing can open up new avenues, such as on-wafer or on-die (i.e., pre-packaging) and in-field (i.e., during customer use) verification of RF performance. Since RF-BIST is about manipulating internal signals, it could naturally assist with RF performance to improve parametric yield so that effective yield approaches that of defect density. Digital designers have mastered BIST long ago and now it is time for the RF community to embrace similar ideas. RF circuit and system designers need to pay close attention to it: Self-testing will affect the selection of RF front-end circuitry and architecture so it cannot be merely viewed as something confined to the back-end sections of a modem.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433876","","Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Circuit testing;Costs;Integrated circuit testing;Life testing;Logic testing;Manufacturing;Radio frequency;Test equipment","","","","0","","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Emerging markets combine the attributes of network processors (many-threaded low-power cores) and server processors (large cores with virtualization and RAS). Higher levels of memory integration are achieved by using embedded DRAM in these large processors to support the higher-bandwidth demands of throughput computing. The challenges of managing the dramatic growth in dynamic power and leakage (if all integrated components were allowed to activate simultaneously) are addressed with a variety of innovative power management methods such as on-die gating and multiple voltage and frequency domains.

Traditionally, slower flash memory in conjunction with DRAM has been used. In addition, flash memory is not well suited as an embedded non-volatile memory in SOC platforms due to the added complexity and cost.

The design of DC-DC converters in these advanced power management systems is very challenging and is critical to achieving optimal operating performance as well as the overall power efficiency of the systems. These DC-DC converters are not only needed to provide a constant regulated voltage to power up individual building blocks, they also need to provide, in some cases, multiple output voltages for the complex systems or adaptive output voltages for efficiency and performance improvement.

Particularly, single-chip OEICs with on-chip silicon photodiodes provide a number of advantages including low cost, reduced ground-bounce, and bond-wire-induced coupling. Nevertheless, the slow response of silicon photodiodes in a standard CMOS process serves as a major bottleneck for high-speed communication [1]. To improve the bandwidth of silicon photodiodes, either some process modification or avalanche photodiode implementation has been developed. However, the former results in increased costs, whereas the latter has reliability issues. Although a differential photodiode configuration was originally proposed for bandwidth extension [2–4], the operation speed is still limited to several-hundred Mb/s. Meanwhile, the bandwidth can be extended by exploiting equalization filter [1, 3]. For relatively low-Gb/s operations, fixed equalization filter is sufficient, because photodiode responsivity is dominantly determined by diffusion currents which are not sensitive to process and temperature variations. For higher speeds, the responsivity becomes strongly dependent on the process and temperature variations, because it is mainly determined by the carrier mobility. Thereby, equalizers for high-Gb/s optical receivers require an adaptation algorithm to compensate the significant process and temperature variations. In this paper, an OEIC with on-chip photodiode is presented. Bandwidth and responsivity are compensated by a compact adaptive equalizer, thus achieving 8.5Gb/s operation.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5434720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5434720","","Application specific integrated circuits;Bandwidth;Costs;Filters;Optical fiber communication;Optoelectronic devices;Photodiodes;Photonic integrated circuits;Silicon;Temperature sensors","","","","2","3","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, 2G systems like GSM/EDGE are providing worldwide coverage for voice and basic data services. The increasing demand of about 4 billon users has led to high demand for low cost multi-standard, multi-mode and multi-band terminals. RF integration using reconfigurable circuits is a key technology to achieve the required technical performance as well as the even more important cost position. Another important commercial aspect of mobile communication systems is the efficient usage of the available spectrum by cognitive radio techniques. The key for this view of cognitive radio is a reconfigurable RF frontend providing the required flexibility. Therefore the wireless forum will investigate the current status and R&D trends in reconfigurable systems focusing on non-4G based reconfigurable RF and reconfigurable data converters. Target systems include cognitive radio and multi-mode/multi-standard systems including short range systems like Bluetooth and WLAN. The forum will cover reconfigurable RF front-ends, their corresponding reconfigurable A/D converters as well as performance on demand concepts and adaptive power consumption.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433860","","CMOS technology;Circuits and systems;Cognitive radio;Costs;Instruments;Integrated circuit technology;Microelectronics;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Solid state circuits","","","","0","","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This demand has driven the data rates to 10Gb/s and beyond. Currently, there are two approaches to address the increasing bandwidth requirement for high-speed transceivers: one is to increase the number of parallel lines while maintaining the line rate and the other is to increase the data rate per line while maintaining the number of parallel lines. The former eases the requirement for clock and data recovery, as the clock can be forwarded with small overhead. This is applicable to cases where the channel is short and linear equalization is sufficient to compensate for the channel loss. The latter reduces the number of pins on the chips and reduces the board area at the expense of more complicated equalization scheme and techniques for clock and data recovery (CDR). This is applicable to cases where the channel is long and linear equalization is no longer sufficient.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5434012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5434012","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Delay;Frequency;Injection-locked oscillators;Intersymbol interference;Jitter;Transceivers","","","","0","","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For moderate-to-high speed applications, other ADC structures such as flash and pipeline have been traditionally the architecture of choice. However, in the recent past, the increasing speed of devices in scaled CMOS technologies has enabled successive-approximation ADCs to penetrate the medium-to-high-speed application domains. Additionally, the lower intrinsic gain of transistors and opamps in scaled CMOS has made the successive-approximation structures more appealing, because in most such implementations an opamp is often not required. Therefore, much recent research activity has been invested in this type of ADCs. In this session, newest advancements in SAR ADCs that push resolution, FoM, and/or speed to the next level are presented.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433828","","","","","","0","","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid reduction of feature size has made it possible to integrate larger and higher performance on-die memories for various logic applications. Technology scaling also creates growing challenges for the embedded memory designer. It is increasingly difficult to scale density while maintaining adequate cell margins for robust read and write operations. The degradation of intrinsic cell design margins, induced by growing device variations, has led to innovative design solutions to overcome these challenges. Among them, advanced peripheral circuit techniques to improve read and write margins have been explored extensively with focus on more intelligent use of power supplies. On-die adaptive design techniques that automatically compensate process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations are also emerging to further improve the design robustness for high-volume manufacturing requirements. While improving and optimizing the transistor characteristics in SRAMs, 1T1C-based DRAM technology (eDRAM) has made significant progress in recent years and it is successfully integrated into leading logic processes. After years of promise, an eDRAM-based large on-die cache now has finally arrived in a high-performance microprocessor.","0193-6530","978-1-4244-6033-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433888","","","","","","0","","","","","7-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090305","2008","","","524","633","A wake-up receiver (WuRx) is used in wireless sensor networks (WSN) to detect wireless traffic directed to a node's receiver and activate it upon detection, improving network latency and energy dissipation by maximizing data transceiver sleep time. The always-on nature of the WuRx sets a power dissipation floor for the entire system. In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the data rate reaches 40Gb/s, skin-effect and dielectric loss in the transmission medium cause significant loss at high frequencies, leading to considerable ISI even if the data is transmitted over a short copper cable. To reduce the ISI and improve the BER, extensive equalization is required in the receiver side. It is also highly desirable to integrate the equalizer with the CDR circuit on the same chip. This paper describes a 40Gb/s CMOS serial-link receiver that performs both adaptive equalization and CDR.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523076","","Adaptive equalizers;Bit error rate;Broadband communication;Circuits;Communication cables;Copper;Dielectric losses;Frequency;Intersymbol interference;Propagation losses","CMOS integrated circuits;adaptive equalisers;radio receivers","BER;CDR circuit;CMOS serial-link receiver;adaptive equalization;bit error rate;bit rate 40 Gbit/s;broadband communication systems;data rate;dielectric loss;skin-effect;transmission medium","","7","1","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detector signals to be measured are low currents in the range of 5pAto15nA, with bandwidths up to 100 Hz. In order to capture binding dynamics of the fluorescent probe, as well as a wide range of possible tumor sizes and depths, the desired current resolution is 5pA. In applications with such low bandwidths and high sensitivity, a capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) can be used to provide high SNR through noise averaging (Ou and Chin, 203). The input current is integrated onto a capacitor C<sub>int</sub> for a period of time T<sub>int</sub>. The output of the CTIA is usually sampled and held at the end of T<sub>int</sub>, before being digitized as a DC signal. The readout noise power introduced at the sampling instant, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>read</sub>, limits the maximum achievable SNR of this architecture.

Proper transistor layout, complete and accurate modeling and optimized parasitic extraction method enabled the robust design of the wideband super-heterodyne architecture to support the entire 57- to-66GHz band. The analog radio front-end is controlled by a serial digital interface and has been co-designed and integrated together with a high-speed digital signal processor including analog-to-digital conversion, high speed PHY signal processing such as frequency-offset compensation, phase tracking, FIR and DFE, to support both advanced OFDM and SCBT modulation scheme. The resulting single-chip solution enables data throughputs exceeding 7Gb/s (QPSK) and 15Gb/s (16QAM) for a total DC power budget of below 200mW in TDD operation.

Still, the choice of the receiver architecture entails several peculiar considerations in order to achieve a robust low-power solution. On the other hand, at high frequencies, to save power in both the VCO and dividers, it is desirable to synthesize a reference frequency that is lower than the received frequency. The authors have proposed a half-harmonic 24 GHz direct-conversion I/Q-receiver front-end with integrated multi-phase LO generation in 65 nm CMOS.

Many standards however, call for larger vertical eye openings that require raising the dc supply voltage from the 1.0 V limit for thin-oxide devices(FETs) in 65 nm technology to 1.2 or 1.5 V. These requirements are addressed in the proposed SST transmitter design by combining a thin-oxide pre-driver stage running at 1.0 V followed by thick-oxide output stages operated at 1.5 V. Key features of this design include the implementation of tri-statable output slices consisting of programmable binary-weighted pre-distortion slices to achieve a mutually independent adjustment of the impedance tuning and FIR-based transmitter equalization, the level shifter design and the application of T-coils that enable a broad-band impedance matching with a return loss of -16 dB over 10 GHz bandwidth. Moreover, the transmitter is capable to suppress the clock duty-cycle distortion by a factor of 5x.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523081","","Circuits;Clocks;Electrostatic discharge;FETs;Impedance;Loss measurement;MOSFETs;Multiplexing;Optical transmitters;Resistors","CMOS integrated circuits;FIR filters;clocks;coils;driver circuits;equalisers;field effect transistors;impedance matching;transmitters","CMOS;FET;FIR-based transmitter equalization;SST transmitter design;bit rate 8.5 Gbit/s;clock duty-cycle distortion suppression;high-swing source-series-termination;impedance tuning;programmable binary-weighted predistortion;return loss;size 65 nm;source-series-terminated driver;thin-oxide device","","4","3","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of resonant techniques have been reported to overcome clock distribution problems. It has a convenient standing-wave mode that separates the low-amplitude segment from the conventional standing wave. The space-filling-curve flexibly distributes the fine clock even to an irregular area. The short latency without hierarchy results in low jitter and low skew. The curve is finally connected to the starting point to obtain a large loop. It reduces the load inductor by half and the reduction reduces the area penalty. The clock distribution network is implemented by employing an interposer.

The 8 PECs perform data-intensive image processing applications such as filtering and histogram calculations. The MA accelerates nearest neighbor search to obtain a final recognition result in real-time.

An efficient CMOS realization demonstrates the principle an achieves lower power and smaller area than other solutions.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523062","","CMOS technology;Feedback circuits;Frequency;H infinity control;Impedance;Linearity;Low pass filters;Prototypes;Threshold voltage;Transfer functions","CMOS integrated circuits;VHF filters;continuous time filters;ladder filters;low-pass filters;transfer functions","1<sup>st</sup>-order low- pass filter;2<sup>nd</sup>-order biquadratic low-pass filter;CMOS design;capacitively loaded source follower;current 100 muA;frequency 280 MHz;ladder filters;reduced overdrive voltages;source-follower-based single-loop continuous-time filter;transfer functions","","6","","2","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide a quantitative design objective, the UMTS standard is targeted. The single-ended-to-differential conversion previously handled by an inter-stage SAW filter is now performed by a balun. The balun is followed by high-P2 MP mixers driven by Cherry-Hooper LO buffers. The MP BB filter is an active-RC 3 rd-order Chebyshev architecture that drives an 8b pipelined ADC with fs=50 MHz. The AP is a scaled-down version of the MP, with the primary difference being the inclusion of an IM3 generator. As scaling reduces the breakdown voltage of CMOS devices and as system integration trends demand the further elimination of off- chip components, there arises a great need to improve the linearity of RF receivers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523128","","3G mobile communication;Adaptive equalizers;Baseband;Circuits;Convergence;Finite impulse response filter;Impedance matching;Radio frequency;SAW filters;Wideband","3G mobile communication;CMOS integrated circuits;Chebyshev filters;active filters;equalisers;mixers (circuits);radio receivers","CMOS device;Cherry-Hooper LO buffer;MP BB filter;RF receiver;UMTS standard;active-RC 3 rd-order Chebyshev architecture;high-P2 MP mixer;wideband direct-conversion receiver","","2","2","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve high memory bandwidth, various techniques such as widening input/output pins shrinking the unit array size, and performing a read operation and a write operation concurrently have been reported. However, these embedded DRAM macros incur considerable area penalty to obtain high memory bandwidth. Among the techniques for achieving high bandwidth, the concurrent read/write operation is a very effective method in performing a read-modify-write function and a double-buffer function for the graphics applications. A pseudo-two-port embedded DRAM macro that performs concurrent read/write operations at high frequency without sacrificing cell efficiency is reported in this paper. To accomplish this, a read/write cross-point switch circuit (RWCC) and distributed steering redundancy switches (DSRS) are introduced. A 32 Mb macro is characterized via a test-chip fabricated in a 65 nm embedded DRAM process.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523164","","","DRAM chips;computer graphics;telecommunication switching","DSRS;RWCC;concurrent read-write operation;cross-point switch circuit;distributed steering redundancy switch;frequency 833 MHz;graphics applications;pseudo-two-port embedded DRAM","","2","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","212","608","In a WCDMA FDD system, since the transmitter and receiver operate concurrently, the receiver is plagued by the transmitter leakage due to finite isolation of antenna duplexer. As a consequence, the transmitter noise at the receive band degrades the sensitivity, unless the noise is further attenuated before reaching the receiver. Due to the modest Q of on-chip inductors, typically the use of a costly SAW filter placed before the PA is inevitable. On the other hand, the external filter may be eliminated through sufficiently lowering the transmitter noise for any given duplexer. However, given the power-noise trade off, in all previous designs due to the lack of an on-chip filtering mechanism, meeting the stringent noise requirement has resulted in an excessive transmitter power dissipation. To address these issues, a feedback-based filtering technique to suppress the receive-band noise with negligible area or power penalty is presented. Stability analysis reveals that with practical transmitter gain distribution, optimum component sizes, and for a typical required noise suppression, using a simple first- or second-order RC LPF, the feedback remains stable and no additional compensation is required.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523132","","Degradation;Filtering;Inductors;Multiaccess communication;Power dissipation;Receiving antennas;SAW filters;Stability analysis;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas","code division multiple access;notch filters;radio transmitters","SAW filter;antenna duplexer;code division multiple access;filtering technique;integrated notch filter;low-power WCDMA transmitter;on-chip inductors;power-noise trade off;stability analysis;transmitter leakage","","8","4","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-k Metal Gate methods, targeted to reducing gate leakage and Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL), have proponents of Gate-First (IBM, GLOBALFOUNDRIES) and Gate-Last (TSMC, Intel), also using different metals for p-channel and n-channel for Vt adjust ment. Partially-depleted SOI continues to be promoted by IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Under consideration for possible later introduc tion at 22/20nm are EUV, multi-beam E-beam and finfets. R&D dollars are increasing, once at 12% of revenue in 1998, now at 18% in 2010. As product design costs rise, the number of projects is declining, needing more synchronization of process and design development. Restrictive design rules (unidirectional poly, no jogs, dummy insertion, structured layout), adaptive architectures and expanded design for manufacturability are needed to address variability. Accurate layout aware modeling for local variability, well proximity effects, STI stress (LOD) and gate implementation are needed.

Expensive scaled CMOS processes are readily used as a technology enabler to provide adequate performance. The high implementation cost of circuits in such processes is justified by the added functionality of the circuits, however it also drives the desire for low-area solutions in standard digital CMOS. For example, low-area inductor-less LNAs take advantage of the high ft of scaled CMOS. Unfortunately, stringent phase noise requirements make inductors unavoidable in VCOs. This leads to solutions with area-demanding multiple- inductor synthesizers or spur-hazardous multiply-and-divide sections to cover the wide frequency range required for multi- standard receivers.

The paper shows the P/E cycle dependence of the threshold-voltage distribution and program/erase time. The threshold-voltage distribution does not degrade, and maintains enough margin to the wordline level (4.5 V) even after 1M P/E cycles. Erase time is 10 ms/block (average) for the first P/E cycle and 20 ms/block (average) after 1M P/E cycles. This is almost the same erase performance as on-board EEPROM, due to the DCNOR structure that does not use the read channel during program operation. On the other hand, program time increase is caused by charge trapping at tunnel oxide, but program time is 500 mus/word (average) even after 1M P/E cycles. The threshold-voltage shift value is only -1V after 1000 hr bake at Ta = 250 degC. These results indicate that the 8 kB E2FLASH is able to replace on-board EEPROM.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523280","","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Channel hot electron injection;Clocks;Control systems;Degradation;EPROM;Nonvolatile memory;Registers;Sensor systems","automotive electronics;flash memories;microcontrollers","DataFLASH module;EEPROM;automotive MCU;charge trapping;program-erase time;storage capacity 8 Kbit;temperature 250 C;threshold-voltage distribution;tunnel oxide","","4","","2","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The generator is built from cascaded quad corrector stages, each of which in turn, can be understood as a modification of a common interpolating 4-stage ring oscillator. In the circuit, the delay of each stage is a linear superposition of the delays Phi of the associated inner and outer loop elements. If the outer loop element inputs are made independent, the driven oscillator is resulted. Provided the input drive is sufficient, the frequency of the driven oscillator is that of the driving input, and the phase of each internal node is an interpolation of the phase of its input drive and the phase of the preceding stage. This interpolation acts to average offsets from quadrature in the incoming phases. If the input drive is insufficient, the oscillator will run near its natural or unloaded frequency, omega<sub>0</sub>=2pif<sub>o</sub>.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523255","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Cutoff frequency;Delay;Design optimization;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Predictive models;Ring oscillators;Transceivers","clocks;interpolation;oscillators","4-stage ring oscillator;cascaded quad corrector stages;linear superposition;open-loop quadrature clock generator;outer loop element inputs","","4","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","224","608","PON is one of the promising solutions for the last-mile communication systems. In PONs, the fast-locked CDR circuit must lock within tens of bit times once the data packets arrive. The so-called burst-mode CDR (BMCDR) circuits with gated VCOs (GVCOs) have been presented. To meet the requirements of different PON standards, a multi-band BMCDR circuit is very desirable. The conventional multi-band technique is realized by a GVCO with dividers. Since the GVCO has to operate at the highest speed, it dissipates a fixed power, even though only a low data rate is required. Furthermore, the dividers introduce extra time delays to reduce the sampling margin that may become an issue for high data rates. In this work, a 20/10/5/2.5Gb/s power-scaling BMCDR circuit is implemented in 90nm CMOS technology. It is aimed to scale the power of a BMCDR circuit for different data rates. To realize a power-scaling multi-band BMCDR circuit, a tri-mode cell can be configured as a GVCO, a divide-by-2 divider, or 2 DFFs. Moreover, improvements are made to address the problem associated with the extra time delays that reduce the sampling margin.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523138","","CMOS logic circuits;Clocks;Delay effects;Latches;Logic circuits;Multiplexing;Phase locked loops;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device measurement;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;optical burst switching;optical fibre networks;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS technology;GVCO/Div2/DFF tri-mode cells;PON standards;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s;bit rate 20 Gbit/s;bit rate 5 Gbit/s;data packets;fast-locked CDR circuit;gated voltage controlled oscillator;multiband BMCDR circuit;passive optical network;power-scaling burst-mode CDR circuit;size 90 nm","","5","2","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The retina can be stimulated from either side (epiretinal (M. Ortmanns et al., 2007) or subretinal (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), (E. Zrenner, 2002)). With a subretinal light sensitive chip, the natural optical system of the eye is still used, allowing the patient to intuitively locate objects. The patient was 1 out of 7, who have been implanted in a clinical study in 2006 in Tuebingen, Germany (E. Zrenner et al., 2007). The space beneath the retina is limited. Either just an electrode array is placed there (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), or a silicon chip thinned to about 70mum, or both. The experiments (E. Zrenner et al., 2007) used a device including a light-sensitive CMOS chip and separate direct stimulation electrodes. The device was connected to an external power supply by a polyimide-ribbon (comparable to (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), however much longer), forming a flexible connection into the eyeball. Feasibility of the wired supply approach for humans was proven; no perception of the ribbon was reported by the patients.

The MIMO radio comprises two identical dual-band transceivers that share a common frequency synthesizer capable of operating in both integer-N and fractional-N modes. In 2.4 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a direct-conversion architecture with a 3.2 GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Direct conversion is used primarily because of its simplicity and the area reduction it offers by eliminating the need for an IF path. A 3.2 GHz synthesizer frequency is used to avoid VCO pulling. The 3.2 GHz synthesizer output f<sub>vco</sub> is divided by two and then mixed with the original 3.2 GHz f<sub>vco</sub> to generate a 4.8 GHz frequency. This 4.8 GHz signal at twice the RF frequency is distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver, the 4.8 GHz signal is divided by two to generate the 2.4 GHz in-phase and quadrature LO signals. In the 5 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a sliding-IF dual-conversion architecture, in which the RF and IF LO signals are centered at 2/3 fRF and 1/3 fRF, respectively. The frequency synthesizer, operating in integer-N mode, thus provides a 3.2 GHz RF LO signal that is buffered and distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver a resistively loaded divide-by-two circuit is used to generate the quadrature LO signals at 1/3 fRF. The channel center frequencies in the 5 GHz band allow integer-N operation of the synthesizer with a relatively high reference frequency, thus improving the phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523205","","Baseband;Digital filters;Dual band;Frequency synthesizers;MIMO;RF signals;Radio frequency;Signal generators;Transceivers;Wireless LAN","CMOS integrated circuits;MIMO communication;system-on-chip;transceivers;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN;VCO pulling;direct conversion architecture;dual-band CMOS MIMO radio SoC;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency 5 GHz;size 0.13 mum;synthesizer frequency;transceivers","","21","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is promising for this purpose. A PWM pixel can convert light intensity to a digital pulse width by using an in-pixel comparator with a low power-supply voltage without any degradation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a low-power dynamic pixel readout in-pixel comparators(DPR) scheme with CGA PWM pixels based on dynamic operation of in-pixel comparators. DPR requires no static bias current even in the pixel readout. The power dissipation of the pixel array is dramatically reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with using normal static pixel readout (SPR).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523053","","Biomedical imaging;CMOS image sensors;CMOS logic circuits;Cameras;Communication system security;Logic circuits;Low voltage;Pixel;Pulse width modulation;Space vector pulse width modulation","CMOS image sensors;comparators (circuits);pulse width modulation;readout electronics","DPR;PWM CMOS imager;SNR;SPR;dynamic pixel readout;in-pixel comparators;pixel array;pulse width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;static pixel readout;submicron logic circuits;voltage 1.35 V","","5","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The variation in V<sub>t</sub> of the DUTs is detected as variation in frequency, measured by on-chip counters, resulting in a simple digital measurement. The circuit is implemented in NMOS and PMOS versions. The standard deviation of local threshold variation measured on a chip-to-chip basis on a full wafer. The results indicate that the test-structure estimates local random mismatch in MOS current (and threshold voltage) with a small time and complexity, and thus enable technology optimization and yield improvement.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523232","","Circuit testing;Counting circuits;Digital circuits;Frequency measurement;MOS devices;Measurement standards;Random access memory;Semiconductor device measurement;Threshold voltage;Yield estimation","MOS digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit testing;voltage measurement;voltage-controlled oscillators","DUT;NMOS;PMOS;VCO;completely digital on-chip circuit;device-under test;digital measurement;local-random-variability measurement;standard deviation;technology optimization;voltage-controlled oscillators","","11","1","8","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They also offer higher-frequency performance than SC modulators as no critical opamp settling is required. CT modulators with low OSR have achieved a DR greater than 75 dB in a 20 MHz band. However, they all suffer from inaccurate active filtering as filter time constants are set by RC and C/Gm values that vary by as much as plusmn20 to 30%. By lowering OSR, the signal band can be widened, but the in-band zero of the NTF should be optimally placed to maximize the DR. Inaccurate NTF zero either degrades the DR or makes the modulator unstable. This work presents an exact time-constant auto-tuning method using an LMS algorithm. With a binary pulse dither injected into the loop at the input of the quantizer, the filter time constant can be calibrated continuously with crystal accuracy until the correlated residual pulse dither disappears in the digital output.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523276","","Active filters;Bandwidth;Capacitors;Delay;Digital filters;Feedback loop;Frequency;Power harmonic filters;Pulse modulation;Sampling methods","CMOS integrated circuits;continuous time systems;delta-sigma modulation;tuning","CMOS technology;automatic tuning;bandwidth 8 MHz;continuous time delta-sigma modulators;pulse injection;size 65 nm","","3","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vision processors realize high GOPS numbers by combining a processor array for parallel operations and a decision processor for other ones. Converting from parallel data in the processor array to scalar in the decision processor creates a throughput bottleneck. Parallel memory accesses also lead to high power consumption.

Without any explicit matching components, S<sub>22</sub> and S<sub>11</sub> are kept less than -9.5 dB and -9.2 dB, respectively, over the frequency range from 0.1 to 6.3 GHz. To achieve wideband output matching, a parallel combination of a common-source amplifier and a source-follower buffer is used. This structure copes with both 50 Omega output resistance, and small output capacitance. The choke in the pre-power-amplifier (PPA) is also eliminated by adopting a push-pull amplifier and by using a modified envelope signal injection biasing scheme. The PPA achieves OP 1dB of 6 dBm, which corresponds to almost the rail-to- rail swing for 1.2 V power supply.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523133","","Broadband amplifiers;CMOS technology;Capacitance;Frequency;Impedance matching;Inductors;Power supplies;Radio transmitters;Rails;Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits;UHF power amplifiers;differential amplifiers;microwave power amplifiers;transceivers","CMOS technology;common-source amplifier;frequency 0.2 GHz to 6.3 GHz;modulation scheme;multimode radio;prepower amplifier;push-pull amplifier;transceiver;voltage 1.2 V","","3","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","540","634","This work introduces correlated level shifting (CLS) that simultaneously decreases the error due to finite opamp gain and allows true rail-to-rail operation. An extra phase is needed, but, surprisingly, there is no speed penalty when compared to a high-gain opamp solution because CLS does not require full settling during the next-to-last phase. In fact, the increased signal swing means that the same SNR can be achieved using smaller sampling capacitors. Thus, it could be argued that CLS can provide accurate results at a higher speed than using a traditional 2-phase operation with a high-gain opamp. For example, with CLS, the performance is maintained over the whole 0.9V supply, whereas a standard configuration has only a 0.6V swing. Thus, the standard configuration requires 2.25x larger sampling capacitors to achieve the same signal to kT/C noise ratio.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523296","","Capacitors;Distortion measurement;Performance gain;Phase estimation;Rails;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device noise;Signal to noise ratio;Solid state circuits;Voltage","amplification;capacitors;operational amplifiers","correlated level shifting;finite opamp gain;high-gain opamp solution;loop gain;rail-to-rail operation;sampling capacitors","","7","4","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contributing to the relatively high WCDMA terminal cost is the low integration of today's WCDMA radios. Since WCDMA is an FDD system the transmitter and receiver are on simultaneously. A duplexer is used to isolate the receiver from the transmit signal but the isolation of small low-cost duplexers is limited, with a guaranteed isolation at the TX frequency of not more than 52dB. For a Class-3 terminal with 2dB TX path loss due to duplexer and switch, the power at the PA output is +26dBm and the receiver will see a TX leakage of up to -26dBm. Today's state-of- the-art WCDMA transceivers deal with the TX blocking problem by using an external TX SAW filter to eliminate TX noise in the RX band and an external LNA and RX SAW filter to achieve sufficient RX linearity. A typical tri-band transceiver requires 6 SAW filters and 3 LNAs. The tri-band WCDMA transceiver presented here eliminates all external SAW filters and LNAs and achieves excellent performance with standard low-cost duplexers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523127","","Baseband;Calibration;Current supplies;Detectors;Multiaccess communication;Power control;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Receivers;SAW filters;Transceivers","code division multiple access;multiplexing equipment;power control;transceivers","FDD system;RX SAW filter;RX band;RX linearity;TX blocking problem;WCDMA transceivers;external LNA;external SAW filters;integrated TX power control;single-chip triband WCDMA-HSDPA transceiver;small low-cost duplexer;triband transceiver","","35","15","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hierarchical top- plate sampling network reduces timing skew with extended sampling times and permits a partitioned clock network for minimum distribution requirements.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523146","","Capacitors;Clocks;Crosstalk;Parasitic capacitance;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Solid state circuits;Switches;Timing;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion","CMOS process;hierarchical top- plate sampling network;highly interleaved ADC;partitioned clock network;redundant channels;size 65 nm;successive approximation ADC channels;voltage 800 mV","","19","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a trade off between these two requirements, as the use of resonant loads offers high power efficiency while an inductor-free approach saves die area resulting in a cheaper design. Since an LC-oscillator topology is mandatory to achieve a minimal current draw, the reduction of the number of coils has to be done in the LNA, the mixer and the quadrature generator. In this work, starting from the LNA-Mixer and VCO (LMV) cell topology, a single-coil low-power receiver shares the bias current among all the RF blocks of the analog front-end.

More than 1 and 2 ENOB reductions are observed in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007) and Kuttner, F., (2002), respectively, because of thermal noise, and degradations could be even worse with scaled supply voltages and the extensive use of dynamic regenerative latches without pre-amplification.

The ITRS roadmap projects that the aggressive device size scaling will result in supply voltage reductions to well below IV, in particular for low-power technologies. The use of alternative energy sources also requires ULV operation in some applications. Achieving sufficient linearity with low power consumption is very challenging for the ULV mixer and baseband circuits. The on-chip LO generation and distribution is difficult due to the low-voltage device bias. We present optimized mixer and filter topologies, and a polyphase LO buffer, used in a low-power ULV receiver for 2.4GHz applications like Bluetooth or Zigbee. The use of spiral inductors is kept to a minimum to avoid their excessive area.

ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","78","597","Receiving a high-power optical signal using a linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is often a very difficult task. Large input photocurrents saturate the TIA and make it insensitive to the input signal. This is especially a problem for optical sensing applications, in which the input photocurrent usually has a very wide dynamic range (DR). Various methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. The 2-stage compression concepts described here significantly improve. The DR is increased by 18 dB compared and by 10 dB. Moreover, the compression is monotonic over the full input current range. The proposed TIA responds linearly to the input currents that are smaller than the first break-point current, while larger currents are logarithmically compressed to avoid the saturation of the TIA. The lower bound on the input DR is given by the equivalent RMS input-noise and it is affected by the TIA transimpedance, which is set by the feedback resistor in the TIA. However, the BW is indirectly proportional to the transimpedance of the TIA, and therefore its minimum of 250 MHz is in the linear region, in which the overall transimpedance. Using the 2-stage compression concept, we simultaneously achieved a low equivalent RMS input-current noise of 58 nA and a very-high overdrive of 200 mA. This concept is also well suited for LAN technologies, optical data-storage systems, wireless IR links and free-space optics.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523065","","High power amplifiers;Monitoring;Optical amplifiers;Optical feedback;Optical noise;Optical saturation;Optical sensors;Photoconductivity;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Stimulated emission","amplifiers;optical information processing;optical sensors;photodiodes","2-stage compression;dynamic range transimpedance amplifier;high-current monitor;high-power optical signal;monotonic logarithmic compression;optical sensing application","","0","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-resolution TDCs become increasingly popular for time-of-flight measurements, full-speed testing, e.g., jitter measurement, clock and data recovery, measurement and instrumentation, and digital PLLs. As the speed leverage of technology scaling decreases below 100nm, robust TDCs with sub-gate-delay resolution are essential. The Vernier TDC requires long delay lines, thus suffers from large latency, area and power consumption. Latency and a resolution limited by the inherent variation-related pulse-width modification are the drawbacks of the pulse-shrinking approach. Parallel gradual-delay elements are particularly susceptible to process variations. The same holds for analog operations on time intervals like delay amplification. Ultra high-resolution TDCs achieve sub-ps resolution but require iterative conversion.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523300","","Clocks;Delay lines;Energy consumption;Instruments;Interpolation;Jitter;Pulse amplifiers;Robustness;Space vector pulse width modulation;Testing","analogue-digital conversion","Vernier TDC;clock recovery;data recovery;delay amplification;delay lines;digital PLL;energy 19 pJ;iterative conversion;jitter measurement;local passive interpolation;mixed-signal functionality;on-chip characterization;parallel gradual-delay elements;process variations;pulse-shrinking approach;single-shot precision;size 90 nm;sub-gate-delay resolution;time 4.7 ps;time-of-flight measurements;time-to-digital converter;variation-related pulse-width modification","","26","6","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The baseband signal is upsampled first to a sampling rate F<sub>M</sub> around 160MHz, using FIR interpolators. I/Q and DC precompensation is then applied, to eliminate the image and LO components at the RF output. A first fine digital gain stage controls the signal level in a 0 to -12 dB range. The baseband signal is then upsampled to F<sub>c</sub>/4, where F<sub>c</sub> is the carrier frequency in the 2.4 to 2.7 GHz range. As the ratio between F<sub>c</sub>/4 and FM is not necessarily integer, a fractional-N interpolator has to be used.

This has resulted in many recent initiatives to fabricate CMOS-based microelectrodes for the stimulation and recording of electrical activity of neurons. CMOS technology offers the potential for monolithic integration of sensors and electronics and it serves as an appropriate platform to facilitate the integration of large arrays of sensors into a small geometry. The extracellular pH of a cell culture is a particularly important indicator of global cellular metabolism, but up until now, this property has typically been measured with invasive and expensive techniques such as miniaturized glass microelectrodes, fluorescent ratio imaging microscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CMOS provides a scalable, low cost, mass manufacturing platform, and offers the potential to develop sensor arrays that can perform non-invasive and long term imaging on cultured cells. In this paper, we present the first 16x16 proton camera array for direct imaging of the hydrogen-ion activity of cell cultures grown in vitro. The proton camera is based on a single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) sensor array technology that can be implemented using a standard commercial CMOS process.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523321","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Cameras;Extracellular;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic sensors;Microelectrodes;Protons;Sensor arrays;Silicon","CMOS image sensors;biosensors;cellular biophysics;ion sensitive field effect transistors;microelectrodes","CMOS proton camera array;CMOS-based microelectrodes;cell culture;cultured cells;direct extracellular imaging;electrical activity;extracellular pH;global cellular metabolism;hydrogen-ion activity;long term imaging;microelectronics industry;monolithic integration;noninvasive imaging;silicon CMOS technology;single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor sensor array technology","","5","70","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fingerprint identification using capacitive fingerprint sensing provides small user-authentication systems. For systems that need a higher level of security, fraud detection, which determines whether the sensed finger is alive or not, is necessary. Integrating fraud detection capability into a capacitive sensor is important because attempted fraud has to be detected at the same time that the fingerprint is captured. Various methods that use information about a finger, such as its electrical characteristics, optical characteristics or elastic characteristics, have been tried. Impedance-sensing is suitable from the viewpoint of using electrical signals. An impedance-sensing circuit should not increase the chip size nor degrade the quality of the captured fingerprint image. To meet these requirements, we propose an impedance-sensing scheme built into a capacitive sensor and implemented as a circuit and electrode without changing the chip size.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523111","","Capacitive sensors;Circuits;Degradation;Electric variables;Fingerprint recognition;Fingers;Image matching;Impedance;Information security;Optical sensors","capacitive sensors;electric impedance measurement;fingerprint identification;fraud;image sensors","artificial finger;capacitive fingerprint sensing;capacitive sensor;elastic characteristics;electrical characteristics;electrical signals;fingerprint identification;fingerprint sensor;impedance sensing;integrating fraud detection;optical characteristics;user-authentication systems","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While eDRAMs have 2.5x to 4x density compared to SRAMs and have lower soft-error rate they are slower in operation. In a conventional DRAM with a single column access device for read and write, a write operation is started only after the bitline sense amplifiers are turned on and the bitlines are well on their way to full restoration. This is to avoid destroying data due to premature access to global bitlines in the non-writing columns. This delay in the write operation increases row cycle time to allow the storage node to be fully written. Accelerating write cycle with early access only in the required columns requires a large area penalty because local sense amplifiers in one bank are usually grouped into a large block where all control signals are shared. Also an embedded DRAM in a standard 65 nm twin-tub SOI CMOS process that uses a local sense amplifier with V<sub>DD</sub> sensing and separate ports for read and write, with these operations synchronized with sensing is described. This eDRAM speeds up the row cycle with low area overhead by reducing the number of signals to control the ports and making write and read operations indistinguishable at the bank level.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523161","","Built-in self-test;Capacitors;Graphics;Random access memory;Reservoirs;Testing;Timing;Tin;Turning;Variable structure systems","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip","SoC integration;bitline sense amplifier;frequency 500 MHz;random-access embedded DRAM macro;size 65 nm;storage capacity 1 Mbit;twin-tub SOI CMOS process","","11","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Co-operability with other communication devices (e.g., cellular and WLAN) operating in the same spectrum is mandatory, setting especially stringent demands on the wideband linearity of such receivers. The use of area-consuming on-chip inductors must be avoided as the cost per area of modern CMOS processes is high. The receiver preferably has a single-ended RF-input, as this avoids the use of an external broadband balun and its accompanying losses.

To demonstrate the proposed techniques we have realized a 3GHz fractional synthesizer based on an 8ps resolution TDC in standard 65nm CMOS. The prototype uses a 25MHz reference and consumes 9.5mW excluding test buffers.

It is seen that in the band where the distributed effect of the DA is in action, the ratio of the forward to reverse gain is substantial (and depends on the number of stages used). The input and output blocks are connected to this core stage to provide matching and stability This method is different from other techniques that improve gain (e.g., cascade of DAs or matrix amplifier) in that it uses a new internal feedback to fed signals go through one DA twice. The input, core and output DA blocks consist of 4/3/3 gain elements respectively except that the core DA uses series input capacitances at the gates for BW enhancement and biasing purposes. Terminations Z<sub>x</sub> and Z<sub>y</sub> are chosen to minimize undesired reflections. The input and output biases are fed through appropriate bias tees. The lower cutoff of the DA is set at 12 GHz for our application in a wideband mm-wave imaging module. This frequency could be extended to frequencies close to 1 GHz if appropriate AC-coupling capacitors are used.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523124","","CMOS technology;Distributed amplifiers;Feedback;Frequency measurement;Impedance;Noise figure;Phased arrays;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device modeling;Topology","CMOS integrated circuits;distributed amplifiers;feedback amplifiers;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave imaging;wideband amplifiers","AC-coupling capacitor;CMOS;DA;broadband distributed amplifier;frequency 660 GHz;internal feedback;wideband mm-wave imaging module","","12","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several implementations have been developed ((Y. W. Huang, et al., 2005), (H.C. Chang, et al., 2007), (T.C. Chen, et al., 2007)), but, their performance is limited to baseline 720p (Y. W.

The main stream 1080p high-profile application presents a series of new design challenges in throughput, cost and power because of at least a 4x higher complexity than in the 720p baseline. Thus, a 0.13mum 1080p high-profile H.264 video encoder is presented with 10mm<sup>2</sup> core and 242 mW power. Compared to a state-of-the-art 720p baseline design (H.C.

Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","454","627","DLL clock multipliers outperform their PLL counterparts in terms of phase noise because they have significantly less jitter accumulation [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reducing dark current has also been challenging for such CIS imagers. At present, the solution to these problems has been to switch to n-type substrates since they have been used for interline charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for decades.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523056","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Color;Colored noise;Computational Intelligence Society;Crosstalk;Detectors;Pixel;Switches","CMOS image sensors;charge-coupled devices;crosstalk;optical transfer function","CMOS image-sensor;charge-coupled devices;color correction matrix;hole-based detector;low-crosstalk;low-dark-current;modulation transfer function","","10","3","8","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent work has shown the use of SC-filtering techniques in radio receivers, where sampling is done early in the RX path. Such discrete-time architectures require an early anti-aliasing (AA) filter prior to sampling. Multiple AA and channel filters with decimation stages have been used to strongly attenuate alias and adjacent channels and to allow sampling of the signal at a reasonable rate at the ADC stage.IF amplifiers are necessary to drive ADC input stage. The direct-conversion receiver architecture proposed here is based on a fully-passive CMOS approach.

With this architecture, both fast lock time and low jitter are achieved by the system transfer function being changed; it is unnecessary to vary the values of system parameters in an attempt to reduce lock time. The HSPLL uses a reconfigurable delay line (RDL) that, depending upon the state of its switch circuit (SC), can operate either as a voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) or a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). When the RDL is operating as a VCDL (i.e. when the total circuit is a VCDL-PLL, a first-order system), lock time is fast and jitter is low, but it is difficult to generate a frequency-multiplied signal. This makes the VCDL-PLL configuration appropriate for the unlocked state. Then, at the instant that the HSPLL changes from the unlocked state to the locked, the condition of the SC is changed to create a VCO-PLL, a second-order system in which it is easy to generate a frequency-multiplied signal but difficult to achieve fast lock time (i.e. a situation well-suited to a locked state). This HSPLL architecture allows use of the respective advantages of both VCDL- and VCO-PLLs without having to suffer from their various disadvantages. The HSPLL is implemented in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS and two-layer metal technology. 2010 transistors are integrated into a 480/spl times/450 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ die area.

There is a simple solution, namely, a Cartesian I-Q upconverter followed by a linear power amplifier, but for complex modulations its power conversion efficiency is often under 10%. Therefore, the search continues for a more efficient solution. One possibility is to harness the high efficiency of a saturated power amplifier but somehow make it deliver amplitude-modulated waveforms. Polar modulation has found use in enabling EDGE on GSM handsets, but we believe outphasing, or linear amplification using nonlinear components (LINC), offers a more enduring solution for a broader class of modulations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523310","","Capacitors;Degradation;GSM;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Switches","amplitude modulation;power amplifiers;radio transmitters;software radio","Cartesian I-Q upconverter;EDGE;GSM handsets;amplitude-modulated waveforms;linear amplification;linear power amplifier;nonlinear components;outphasing power amplifier;polar modulation;power conversion efficiency;saturated power amplifier;software-defined radio transmitter;universal modulator","","31","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an ADC that takes advantage of the high-speed digital logic and highly matched small capacitors in deep-submicron digital CMOS processes to achieve similar performance, but with lower power consumption than flash ADCs. Unlike many previously published low-power high-speed ADCs based on time-interleaved SAR, this ADC has only 2 clock-cycle latency (1.6ns at 1.25GS/s) and achieves 6b performance without any digital post-processing or off-line calibration, making it a plug- in replacement for conventional flash ADCs in many applications.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523297","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS process;Calibration;Capacitors;Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Frequency;Magnetic recording;Sampling methods","CMOS logic circuits;analogue-digital conversion","6b resolution;SAR ADC;UWB receivers;clock-cycle latency;deep-submicron digital CMOS process;fash ADC;gigahertz sampling frequency;high-speed digital logic;lower power consumption;magnetic recording systems;power 32 mW;serial links;size 0.13 mum","","2","3","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An SoC for mobile phones defines 23 hierarchical power domains but most of the power domains are assigned for peripheral IPs that mainly use low-leakage high-V<sub>t</sub> transistors. Since high-performance multiprocessor SoCs use leaky low-V<sub>t</sub> transistors for CPU sections, leakage power savings of these CPU sections is a primary objective. We develop an SoC with 8 processor cores and 8 user RAMs (1 per core) targeted for power-efficient high-performance embedded applications. We assign these 16 blocks to separate power domains so that they can be independently be powered off. A resume mode is also introduced where the power of the CPU is off and the user RAM is on for fast resume operation. An automatic parallelizing compiler schedules tasks for each CPU core and also performs power management for each CPU core. With the help of this compiler, each processor core can operate at a different frequency or even dynamically stop the clock to maintain processing performance while reducing average operating power consumption. The compiler also executes power-off control of unnecessary CPU cores.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523071","","Automatic control;CMOS technology;Clocks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency synchronization;Leakage current;Optimizing compilers;Registers;Resumes","embedded systems;logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallelising compilers;random-access storage;system-on-chip","8640 MIPS SoC;CPU core;RAM;automatic parallelizing compiler;embedded application;hierarchical power domain;high-performance multiprocessor SoC;mobile phones;power efficient SoC design;power management;power-off control;processor cores","","12","","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using quarter-circle shaped electrodes, similar to an ultrasonic motor, multiple output voltage phases are obtained from a single resonating piezoelectric disk. Two-electrode transducer outputs are often rectified using a full-wave diode bridge rectifier, which requires a significant voltage drop between input and output, decreasing the rectifier's voltage efficiency. Previous asynchronous rectifiers use MOS switches to avoid the diode drop, however they lack the ability to efficiently rectify the multiple output phases generated from a disk-shaped transducer. Other CMOS rectifiers need two input waveforms that are equal and opposite, which a piezoelectric transducer may not generate for many input vibrations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523177","","Detectors;Electrodes;Frequency;Inverters;Piezoelectric transducers;Rectifiers;Solid state circuits;Switches;Threshold voltage;Vibrations","electrodes;piezoelectric devices;rectifying circuits","MOS switches;asynchronous full-wave rectifier;full-wave diode bridge rectifier;multiphase piezoelectric energy harvesters;multiple-electrode disk-shaped piezoelectric generator;piezoelectric disk;ultrasonic motor;voltage drop","","10","1","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The LDO regulator has to be stable for all load conditions and frequency compensation is usually needed to stabilize the regulation loop. The output voltage droop due to rapid and large load changes could be minimized with a fast regulation loop, such that functional blocks powered by the same LDO regulator would have low crosstalk noise. A low-voltage fast transient-response LDO regulator using an inexpensive 0.35 mum CMOS process is presented in this paper.

To meet the stringent requirements, we develop a 16 Gb 4-level NAND flash memory in 43 nm CMOS technology. In 43 nm generation, gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) influences the electrical field on both sides of NAND strings. GIDL causes severe program disturb problems to NAND flash memories. To avoid GIDL, two dummy wordlines (WL) on both sides of NAND strings are added. This is effective because the dummy gate voltages, are selected independent of the program inhibit voltage.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523241","","CMOS technology;Character generation;Costs;Decoding;Driver circuits;Nonvolatile memory;Routing;Switches;Variable structure systems;Voltage","CMOS logic circuits;NAND circuits;flash memories","CMOS technology;GIDL;NAND flash memory;WL;dummy wordlines;gate-induced drain leakage;size 43 nm","","2","6","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Miniature as well as micro-machined thermoelectric generators (TEG) can become a suitable compact power supply for both on-the-body and industrial sensors. To minimize the overall size of the power supply, the generator has to work at its maximum power point. Due to varying thermal conditions, the generated power and voltage are not constant. Typically the output voltage is lower than the power supply voltage of the sensor. For these reasons, a power management circuit (PMC) with maximum power-point tracking capability and containing a DC/DC-converter with variable conversion factor is required that stores the generated energy in a rechargeable battery or capacitor.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523176","","Circuits;Electrical equipment industry;Electricity supply industry;Power generation;Power supplies;Sensor systems;Thermal sensors;Thermoelectricity;Voltage;Wireless sensor networks","DC-DC power convertors;power supply circuits;thermoelectric conversion;wireless sensor networks","DC/DC-converter;ambient environmental energy;capacitive power-management circuit;capacitor;compact power supply;electrical energy;energy scavenging;industrial sensors;micromachined thermoelectric generators;micropower thermoelectric generators;on-the-body sensors;power 2.1 muW;power energy-autonomous wireless sensor systems;rechargeable battery;thermal conditions;variable conversion factor","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","466","628","The frequency divider (FD) is one of the key components in very-high-frequency (VHF) PLLs. Conventionally, injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) , Miller frequency divider, and CML static divider are widely used in various applications. Among these dividers, the ILFD has the highest operation frequency, but the locking range is limited. On the other hand, the static FD covers a wide locking range, but its operation frequency is low and the power consumption is usually high. Since a FD connected to a VCO operates at the highest frequency, the power dissipation and the locking range of a VHF FD should be carefully considered. In a PLL, due to the process and temperature variations, the locking range of the ILFD must be several times larger than the tuning range of the VCO. Thus, it is challenging to design a wide locking-range and low-power ILFD in the millimeter-wave applications. To achieve a higher operational frequency for an ILFD, the distributed LC oscillator is adopted. To widen the locking range of an ILFD, the transconductance-enhancement technique is presented. In this paper, two low-power ILFDs have a locking range of 85.1 to 96.3 GHz and 98.9 to 105.2 GHz, respectively.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523259","","CMOS technology;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Inductors;Parasitic capacitance;Power measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Spirals;Transconductance;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency dividers;phase locked loops","CMOS technology;ILFD;VHF;W-band frequency divider;frequency 85.1 GHz to 96.3 GHz;frequency 98.9 GHz to 105.2 GHz;injection-locked frequency divider;locking range;millimeter-wave applications;phase locked loops;power 3.5 mW;very-high-frequency PLL","","20","","8","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The white pixel, however, saturates at low light levels and sufficient dynamic range cannot be obtained as a result.

Conventional 6T-cell-based SRAMs do not provide enough density for this trend, although they do have the desirable feature of high-speed access. To overcome the density limitation, an SRAM using a double- stacked S<sup>3</sup> (stacked single-crystal Si) SRAM cell was introduced for mobile applications. This work demonstrates a high-speed SRAM using double-stacked-cell. From the process point of view, our design uses fully proven technologies for mass production at the sacrifice of cell size.From a circuit-design perspective, three schemes are introduced. They are automatic cell bias (ACB) for managing the current of SRAM cell transistors by controlling cell bias, adaptive block redundancy (ABR) for dealing with various defects from the new cell technology, and wordline pulse-width regulation (WPR) for adjusting wordline pulse-width according to cycle time.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523219","","Adaptive control;Automatic control;Cache memory;Circuits;Mass production;Multicore processing;Programmable control;Random access memory;Space vector pulse width modulation;Technology management","SRAM chips;integrated circuit design","adaptive block redundancy;automatic cell-bias;circuit design;frequency 500 MHz;memory size 72 MByte;multi-core processors;size 100 nm;synchronous SRAM cell;wordline pulse-width regulation","","1","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HomePlugAV is one such 200Mb/s powerline modem standard. However, for these devices to fully realize the market potential, the total application cost must be reduced and performance enhancements enabling increased network throughput must be made. Currently, HomePlug-AV products require 4 chips to implement the modem function: a processor, an external memory, an AFE, and an external line driver. With this in mind, this work describes an integrated sub-micron CMOS AFE meeting the HomePlug-AV standard, but with additional Gb/s capability.

Through technology scaling, CMOS CML static divider high-frequency performances have been scaled, and they are comparable to dividers in other technologies. In addition to the device performance, circuit design and measurement determine the divider high-speed and wide frequency range performance. One of the uncertainties in CML static divider measurement is pulling and locking hysteresis. By using CML static divider topology, the divider has been assumed to have a fixed wide operation range, from DC to the f<sub>div</sub> <sub>,</sub> <sub>max</sub>, the maximum input-referred divider operational frequency. In fact, the CML static dividers show a certain degree of locking hysteresis, similar to injection-locking dividers. When the circuit sensitivity curve is measured, it is not clear where to set the threshold. Depending on the method, a sensitivity curve can be optimistic or pessimistic. A similar problem lies in the f<sub>div</sub> <sub>,</sub> <sub>max</sub>, since it changes depending on the status of a divider. Also, there have not been any analytic results that can interpret the circuit parameters and performance, in spite of the common use of sensitivity curve in literatures.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523256","","CMOS technology;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Hysteresis;Millimeter wave technology;Performance evaluation;Tunable circuits and devices;Vehicles","CMOS integrated circuits;clocks;current-mode logic;dividing circuits;hysteresis;silicon-on-insulator","SOI CMOS;V-band channel;W-band channel;circuit sensitivity curve;clock-system component;frequency 94 GHz;locking hysteresis;millimeter-wave dividers;tunable current-mode logic static divider","","7","","9","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By resonating the large global clock capacitance with an inductance, the energy used to charge the clock node each period can be recycled within the LC tank network, resulting in lower clock power. Additional power savings are realized by reducing the strength of clock drivers because only losses need to be overcome at resonance. Skew and jitter are improved due to the bandpass characteristic of the LC network and the use of fewer clock buffering stages. We describe how the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE) processor is experimentally transformed to have a resonant-load global clock distribution similar to the one in (Chan et al., 2004).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523282","","Capacitors;Clocks;Frequency;Inductors;Jitter;Power measurement;Resonance;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing;Voltage","clocks;microprocessor chips","LC tank network;bandpass characteristic;cell broadband-engine processor;clock buffering stages;clock drivers;clock node;global clock power;large global clock capacitance;resonant clocking techniques;resonant global clock distribution;timing uncertainty","","5","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These converters have to combine the stringent speed specifications with the demand for low power consumption. Flash architectures are often chosen because they offer the largest speed. However, in this architecture, area and power depend exponentially on the resolution since the comparators are often the largest contributor to the overall power consumption. Folding is a well-known technique used to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high speed. It was previously implemented by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers, often in combination with interpolation or averaging. In this design, a folding factor of 2 is realized as in but with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers. This reduces the number of comparators from 31 to 16 for a 5b resolution.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523152","","CMOS technology;Calibration;Clocks;Energy consumption;Frequency;Inverters;MOS capacitors;Routing;Switches;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits)","comparators;digital CMOS technique;folding flash ADC;low power consumption;power 2.2 mW;size 90 nm;wireless receivers;wireless standards","","30","4","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optical techniques, based on voltage- and calcium-sensitive dyes or photouncaging, along with multi-photon fluorescent microscopy have proven very successful in imaging activity in slices and in vivo. However, studies have been limited by the ability to stimulate different regions of tissue with enough spatial resolution and throughput. Traditional stimulation is accomplished with passive multielectrode arrays (MEAs) or bipolar electrodes. In both cases, a relatively small number of stimulation sites with coarse spatial resolution are possible. While there has been recent work on the development of CMOS chips for extracellular recordings of cultured neurons or slices on planar electrodes, the focus of this work is on stimulation and achieving stable electrical interfaces between acute slices and a high-density active CMOS MEA. As brain slices preserve many synaptic connections, they are ideal preparations to study neuronal microcircuits in vitro.

In a polar transmitter, high-efficiency non-linear power amplifiers can be used for linearly modulated waveforms. Because of envelope bandwidth expansion in polar modulated transmitters, the design of a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency supply modulator is one of the most challenging aspects of a polar transmitter. The most common technique for providing wide-bandwidth low-noise supply modulation in a linear system PA is by using linear low-dropout regulators, however at backed-off power levels their efficiencies are low. Envelope tracking is another common technique for transmitter design. Although this technique relaxes the bandwidth requirement of the supply modulator, it uses a less efficient linear power amplifier. A parallel combination of linear and switch-mode regulators for a polar PA is proposed. A similar topology for EDGE PA regulators has been proposed.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523250","","Degradation;Delay;Feedback loop;High power amplifiers;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Regulators;Transmitters;Voltage","HF amplifiers;code division multiple access;low noise amplifiers;modulation;power amplifiers;radio transmitters","CDMA transmitter;PA-supply regulator;frequency 10 MHz;high-linearity power amplifier system;polar modulation","","16","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
