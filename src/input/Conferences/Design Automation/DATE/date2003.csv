This paper presents a complete and fully qualified mixed-signal top-down design flow for non volatile memory applications. It has been successfully applied to an embedded flash macrocell based design as well as to a 14 bit analog/digital converter with digital non linearity compensation manufactured in 0.18 μm proprietary flash technology. One remarkable feature of the proposed methodology is the high level of integration among EDA tools from different vendors and internally developed solutions. The mixed-signal domain has been really explored at all levels: functional, behavioural, VHDL/schematic and post layout with parasitic components. Furthermore, we propose a bottom-up methodology to generate and validate VHDL-AMS models for IP analog cells. All the illustrated features are integrated in a design flow which provides full compatibility and flexibility between analog and digital design steps to cut down time-to-design, improve time-to-market and streamline design quality.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1186708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186708","","Automata;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Europe;Flowcharts;Macrocell networks;Nonvolatile memory;Software libraries;Switches;Threshold voltage","analogue-digital conversion;circuit CAD;circuit simulation;flash memories;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;random-access storage","0.18 micron;EDA tools integration;IP analog cells;VHDL-AMS models;analog/digital converter;bottom-up design;digital nonlinearity compensation;embedded flash macrocell;nonvolatile memories technologies;top-down mixed-signal design flow","","0","3","7","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is to use SystemC to describe both the application and a set of algorithmic IP cores to be incorporated throughout the design flow. Our methodology supports design refinement through four main abstraction levels, offers verification techniques at each level and allows the use of EDA co-verification tools. The use of C++/SystemC to model all parts of the system provides great flexibility and enables faster simulation compared to existing methodologies.

This affinity explains the ease of generating synchronous circuits and verify their functionalities using compilers and related tools that implement this approach. In the relational model of the SIGNAL/POLYCHRONY design language/platform this affinity goes beyond the domain of purely synchronous circuits to embrace the context of architectures consisting of synchronous circuits and desynchronization protocols: GALS architectures. The unique features of this model are to provide the notion of polychrony: the capability to describe multiclocked (or partially clocked) circuits and systems; and to support formal design refinement, from the early stages of requirements specification, to the later stages of synthesis and deployment, and by using formal verification techniques.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253786","","Circuit synthesis;Circuits and systems;Clocks;Context modeling;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic design;Protocols;Signal design;Synchronous generators","asynchronous circuits;clocks;formal specification;formal verification;high level synthesis","GALS architectures;SIGNAL/POLYCHRONY design language/platform;asynchronous system;desynchronization protocols;formal design refinement;formal verification;hardware-software co-design;high-level synthesis;integrated circuit intuitive models;multiclocked circuits;partially clocked circuits;relational modeling;requirements specification;synchronous design models;synchronous hypothesis;system design","","0","","5","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In search for responses to these challenges, Transaction level modeling (TLM) has got quite some attention in the area of SoC design. This panel attempts to do a reality check on TLM from an engineering point of view. Questions to discuss are: Is the Transaction Level (TL) really useful for the design and/or for the verification of SoCs? How can TL speed up the design process and lowering the risk of design failures? What are the implications on tools, languages, and Intellectual Property (IP) used in the design/verification process?

Many of the technical problems are solved and re-solved on a piecemeal basis, focusing on local optimizations of small design-space problems. Unfortunately, many of these local solutions really create a less apparent but larger inefficiency in the whole design flow. The reason for this is that few ever look at the whole design methodology, especially as it applies to large design teams.

It allows us to use prelude vectors to resolve dependencies created by fanning out multiple scan chains from a single scan-in pin. This paper describes the new proposed architecture as well as the algorithm that generates compressed test vectors using a vertex coloring algorithm. The distribution of specified bits in each test pattern determines the compression ratio of the individual test pattern. Therefore, our technique optimizes the overall compression ratio and shows higher reduction in test data and application time than previous techniques, which use the extreme case of serializing all the scan chains in the presence of conflicts across the fanout scan chains. The FSCANF architecture has small hardware overhead and is independent of scan cell orders in the scan chains. Experimental results show that our technique significantly reduces both the test data volume and test application time in six of the largest ISCAS 89 sequential benchmark circuits compared to the previous techniques.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253595","","Benchmark testing;Circuit testing;Cost function;Design for testability;Design optimization;Feedback;Flip-flops;Hardware;Power capacitors;Sequential analysis","boundary scan testing;circuit feedback;data compression;logic simulation;logic testing;optimisation","FSCANF;compressed test vectors;compression ratio optimization;fan-out scan chain architecture;feedback architecture;multiple scan chains;prelude vectors;single scan-in pin;test application time;test data reduction;test pattern compression;vertex coloring algorithm","","5","","4","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once designers select a set of standard cells to be customized, they define the specification of the custom cells and develop the cells accordingly. Finally, the designers replace the standard cells with the custom ones and re-evaluate the speed of the design. The customization process continues until the timing constraint is satisfied. In this paper, we present a custom-cell identification method for high-speed datapath-oriented designs.

Especially important is robust design. Its goal is to produce circuits whose behaviour stays within some predefined range when the manufacturing process variations and environmental effects remain bounded. Most of the design process is still handled by IC designers manually. We present a simple mathematical formulation of the robust design and optimization problem and its transformation into a constrained optimization problem by means of penalty functions. We illustrate the method on a robust differential amplifier design problem. The resulting circuits show that a computer not only can improve circuits designed by humans, but is also capable of designing a circuit with very little initial knowledge. Optimization runs resulted in circuits with similar or even better performance when compared to humanly designed circuits.

For the communication, scalable and compositional interconnects, such as networks on chip (NoC) must be used. In this paper, we show that guaranteed services are essential in achieving this decoupling. Guarantees typically come at the cost of lower resource utilization. To avoid this, they must be used in combination with best-effort services. The key element of our NoC is a router consisting conceptually of two parts: the so-called guaranteed throughput (GT) and best-effort (BE) routers. We combine the GT and BE router architectures in an efficient implementation by sharing resources. We show the trade offs between hardware complexity and efficiency of the combined router, and the motivation of our choices. Our reasoning for the trade offs is validated with a prototype router implementation. We show a lay-out of an input-queued wormhole 5×5 router with an aggregate bandwidth of 80 Gbit/s.

We verify and evaluate the performance of each bus system in the context of two applications: an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless transmitter and an MPEG2 decoder. This methodology gives the designer a great benefit in fast design space exploration of bus architectures across a variety of performance impacting factors such as bus types, processor types and software programming style. In this paper, we show that BusSyn can generate buses that achieve superior performance when compared to a simple general global bus architecture (GGBA) (e.g., 16.44% performance improvement in the case of the OFDM transmitter) or when compared to the coreconnect bus architecture (CCBA) (e.g., 15.54% performance improvement in the case of the MPEG2 decoder).

The main contribution of this paper is the formal treatment of transformational design refinement. Using the formal semantics of ForSyDe processes we introduce the term characteristic function to be able to define and classify transformations as either semantic preserving or design decision. We also illustrate how we can incorporate classical synthesis techniques that have traditionally been used with control/data-flow graphs as ForSyDe transformations.

And, in the latter, operations performed in states provide the information of resource requirements which can be used to determine the resource sharing among states. The goal is to synthesize circuits such that the submachine with small area (data-path and controller) will be turned on most of the time (high state probability) and all other parts are turned off.

This methodology has been applied to the design of a CMOS 12-bit 400 MHz current-steering segmented D/A converter.

This increases the opportunities to apply code motions, such as conditional speculation that duplicate operations into the branches of a conditional block. (2) Determining if an operation can be conditionally speculated into multiple basic blocks either by using existing idle resources or by creating new scheduling steps. These strategies lead to balancing of the number of steps in the conditional branches without increasing the longest path through the conditional block. Algorithms for these strategies have been implemented within the Spark high-level synthesis framework that accepts a behavioral description in ANSI-C as input and produces synthesizable register-transfer level VHDL.

These features are also useful for debuggers, class and object browsers, design analyzers, composition validation, type checking, compatibility checking, etc. However the central question is whether such features should be integrated into the language, or if we should build frameworks which feature these capabilities in a meta-layer leaving the system-level language intact. In our recent interactions with designers, we have found differing opinions. Especially in the context of SystemC, the temptation to integrate reflective APIs into the language is great, because C++ is expressive, and already has type introspective packages available. In this paper, we analyze this issue and show that (i) it is a better EDA system architecture to implement reflection/introspection at a meta-layer in a design framework (it) there are relatively unexplored territories of design automation, such as behavioral typing of component interfaces, corresponding type-theory, and their implication in automating component composition, interface synthesis, and validation, which can be better incorporated if the introspection is implemented at a meta-layer.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253638","","Computer languages;Design automation;Displays;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware design languages;Intellectual property;Libraries;Packaging;Reflection;System-level design","hardware description languages","C++ language;CAD tool;SystemC language;electronic design automation;integrated introspection;meta-level introspection;reflective API;system-level language","","7","3","16","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These instructions perform a variety of multiply-operations with various data bit-widths and concurrent-execution requirements. For instance, such an instruction set may include instructions to perform signed/unsigned 32×32, signed/unsigned dual 16×16, signed/unsigned 8×8 MAC, and etc. Typically, a co-processor or a complex MAC (Multiplier-ACcumulator) unit is required to execute those instructions. Developing such a complex MAC/co-processor involves a series of design tasks including micro-architecture design, component allocation/binding, interconnect binding, pipeline insertion and control generation. This design process is non-trivial, time-consuming and error-prone, which is usually performed by experienced design engineers. In this paper, we present a synthesis method for application-specific MAC/coprocessor generation. The MAC/co-processor synthesis problem is defined as: Given a set of instructions and the number of execution cycles for each instruction, generate a MAC/co-processor design (including a data-path and a control unit) such that the total area-cost is minimized subject to the given execution-cycle constraints. The MAC/co-processor generation consists of the following two steps. In the first step, we determine a set of minimum-cost components required to realize the given instruction set. In the second step, we perform micro-architectural-level synthesis tasks, including component mapping, interconnect synthesis, pipeline insertion, and control synthesis to generate the MAC/co- processor design.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253769","","Coprocessors;Costs;Design engineering;Partitioning algorithms;Pipelines;Process design;Resource management;Sorting;Synthesizers","application specific integrated circuits;coprocessors;instruction sets;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;pipeline processing","G-MAC;application-specific MAC/co-processor synthesizer;application-specific processor generation;complex multiply-operations;component allocation/binding;execution cycle constraints;execution cycles;instruction set;interconnect binding;micro-architecture design;pipeline insertion;special-purpose processor;total area-cost","","0","","","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue, and demonstrate, that significant energy savings could be ""left on the table"" if energy is not considered during the design of the software architecture. As a first step towards addressing this gap, we propose a systematic framework for software architectural transformations to reduce energy consumption. We consider software architectural transformations in the context of the multi-process software style driven by an operating system (OS), which is very commonly employed in energy-sensitive embedded systems. Our methodology for applying software architectural transformations consists of: (i) constructing a software architecture graph representation, (ii) deriving initial energy and performance statistics using a detailed energy simulation framework, (iii) constructing sequences of atomic software architectural transformations, guided by energy change estimates derived from high-level energy macro-models, that result in maximal energy reduction, and (iv) generation of program source code to reflect the optimized software architecture. We employ a wide suite of software architectural transformations whose effects span the application-OS boundary, including how the program functionality is structured into architectural components (e.g., application processes, signal handlers, and device drivers), and connectors between them (inter- component synchronization and communication mechanisms). We present experimental results on several multi-process embedded software programs, in the context of an embedded system that features the Intel StrongARM processor and the embedded Linux OS. The presented results clearly underscore the potential of the proposed methodology (up to 66.1% reduction in energy is obtained). In a broader sense, our work demonstrates the impact of considering energy during the earlier stages of the software design process.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253742","","Embedded software;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Operating systems;Optimizing compilers;Software architecture;Software design;Software performance;Software systems;Statistics","embedded systems;minimisation;operating systems (computers);software architecture","Intel StrongARM processor;embedded Linux OS;energy consumption reduction;energy simulation framework;energy-sensitive embedded systems;high-level energy macro-models;low energy embedded software;multi-process embedded software programs;multi-process software style;operating system;performance statistics;program source code generation;software architectural transformations;software architecture graph representation;software design process","","8","","18","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, an obstacle to the adoption of abstract modeling as standard design practice is the lack of well establishes methodologies for the assessment of model precision. We describe such a methodology based on the SystemC Verification Standard implemented by Cadence's TestBuilder-SC. This methodology enables comparison of high-level (transaction level) SoC models in SystemC against implementation RTL models. An application of the methodology is presented, based on the AMBA Class Library (ACL) for SystemC being developed by ARM in collaboration with EDA partners. The key elements of the methodology are: 1. A completely reusable testbench that can be used for simulation and verification of the design at both high-level (transaction level) of abstraction and RTL implementation level. 2.

A set-associative data cache consumes a significant fraction of the total power budget in such embedded processors. This paper describes a technique for reducing the D-cache power consumption and shows its impact on power and performance of an embedded processor. The technique utilizes cache line address locality to determine (rather than predict) the cache way prior to the cache access. It thus allows only the desired way to be accessed for both tags and data. The proposed mechanism is shown to reduce the average L1 data cache power consumption when running the MiBench embedded benchmark suite for 8, 16 and 32-way set-associate caches by, respectively, an average of 66%, 72% and 76%. The absolute power savings from this technique increase significantly with associativity.

Relaxing the requirement of 100% correctness for devices and interconnects drastically reduces the costs of design but, at the same time, requires that SoCs be designed with some system-level fault-tolerance. In this paper, we introduce a new communication paradigm for SoCs, namely stochastic communication. The newly proposed scheme not only separates communication from computation, but also provides the required built-in fault-tolerance to DSM failures, is scalable and cheap to implement. For a generic tile-based architecture, we show how a ubiquitous multimedia application (an MP3 encoder) can be implemented using stochastic communication in an efficient and robust manner.

Test motivation is thus towards methods that can either aid digital only test of the PLL, or alternatively facilitate complete self testing of the PLL. One useful characterisation technique used by PLL designers is that of closed loop phase transfer function measurement. This test allows, an estimation of the PLL's natural frequency, damping, and 3 dB bandwidth to be made from the magnitude and phase response plots. These parameters relate directly to the time domain response of the PLL and will indicate errors in the PLL circuitry.

However the method presented by Basturkmen et al. utilizes tests generated using a deterministic test generator for target faults in synthesizing the Markov source to generate the tests. The requirement of a deterministic test generator may hinder the use of this procedure in industrial settings since the BIST tool must also include a deterministic ATPG tool that may add to the cost of the BIST tool. In this paper we investigate a procedure to synthesize BIST controllers with Markov sources for test generation using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). This allows us to avoid using the deterministic ATPG needed previously. Additionally we do not employ inversion logic used in by Basturkmen et al., thereby potentially reducing the hardware in the BIST controller. Nevertheless, the proposed method achieves close to 100% fault efficiency using far fewer tests than required by pseudo random tests. In this work, similar to that of Basturkmen et al., we employ Markov sources based on finite state machines (FSMs) with transitions controlled by additional inputs. Hence, transition probabilities (TPs) of the FSM are determined by the 1-probability on a corresponding input.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253792","","Automatic test pattern generation;Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Cities and towns;Costs;Electrical fault detection;Evolutionary computation;Fault detection;Phase detection;Testing","Markov processes;automatic test pattern generation;built-in self test;finite state machines;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;probability","BIST controller synthesis;FSM;Markov sources;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary optimization;finite state machines;pseudo random scan BIST;test generation;transition probabilities","","4","","1","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the specification of the functional IPs, such as behavioral and RTL specifications have been widely investigated, the specifications of others, such as timing, constraints, layouts and architectures are largely ad hoc. This leads to different standard or proprietary file/database formats with interoperatability problems, which eventually hinder the distribution and integration of IPs. In this paper, we address the difficult problem of integrating semantically diverse non-functional IPs by the use of a new, extensible language called Babel. Despite its simple 1-page grammar, Babel is frontend for a powerful IP-based design infrastructure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by two case studies, one for the creation of parameterized memory IPs and one for the creation of processor IPs.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253651","","Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Electronic design automation and methodology;Information security;Intellectual property;Specification languages;Standards organizations;Timing;Writing","circuit CAD;formal specification;industrial property;specification languages;system-on-chip","Babel language;design reuse;formal specification;nonfunctional intellectual property component;system-on-chip","","5","","13","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a generic runtime model architecture that can best satisfy the non-functional requirements of the system, and a generic transformation method to convert a structural model to a runtime model in such an architecture.

The exploration phase adopts an iterative local-search algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis of the cost function with respect to the tuning parameters of the system architecture. The exploration targets the architectural optimisation of the parameters related to the cache memory and the bus sub-systems of an embedded architecture based on the MicroSPARC2 architecture executing the set of Mediabench benchmarks for multimedia applications.

Therefore, interconnect optimization has become an important concern in floorplanning today. Most routability-driven floorplanners use a grid-based approach that divides a floorplan into grids as in global routing. Congestion is estimated as the expected number of nets passing through each grid. Although this approach is direct and accurate, it is not efficient when dealing with complex circuits containing thousands of nets. In this paper, an efficient and innovative routability-driven floorplanner, using a twin binary trees (TBT) representation is proposed. The congestion model we used is the wire density on the half-perimeter boundary of different regions in a floorplan. These regions are defined naturally by the TBT representation. In order to increase the efficiency of our floorplanner, a fast algorithm for the least common ancestor (LCA) problem is used to compute the wire density. From the experimental results, the number of unroutable wires can be reduced in a short time.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253713","","Binary trees;Circuit synthesis;Computational efficiency;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Timing;Very large scale integration;Weight measurement;Wire","VLSI;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;trees (mathematics)","TBT representation;VLSI complexity;floorplan half-perimeter boundary;floorplanning congestion evaluation model;interconnect optimization;least common ancestor problem;module interconnections;routability-driven floorplanners;twin binary trees;unroutable wire reduction;wire density control","","1","","10","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamically reprogrammable hardware has been advocated in the academic research community as the next hot area in system design for some time now. The lack of integrated systems in the marketplace that incorporate dynamic reprogramming stands at contrast to the enthusiasm of the research community for the topic. We would like to offer as a middle ground several examples of dynamic reprogramming in working silicon that might help to illuminate the path towards the future of SoCs. In our research at STMicroelectronics, we have built two independent SoCs that utilize embedded FPGAs to provide the dynamic reprogramming capability. The benefit of the embedded FPGA has been demonstrated to range from application acceleration to augmenting functionality and providing silicon area reuse.

As a result, we significantly increase application performance while area constraints are satisfied. Our methodology uses a combination of simulation, estimation and a pre-characterised library of instructions, to select the appropriate co-processors and instructions. We report that by selecting the appropriate coprocessors/functional units and specific TIE instructions, the total execution time of complex applications (we study a voice encoder/decoder), an application's performance can be reduced by up to 85% compared to the base implementation. Our estimator used in the system takes typically less than a second to estimate, with an average error rate of 4% (as compared to full simulation, which takes 45 minutes).

Statistical timing analysis has traditionally suffered from exponential run time complexity with circuit size, due to the dependencies created by reconverging paths in the circuit. In this paper, we propose a new approach to statistical timing analysis which uses statistical bounds. First, we provide a formal definition of the statistical delay of a circuit and derive a statistical timing analysis method from this definition. Since this method for finding the exact statistical delay has exponential run time complexity with circuit size, we also propose a new method for computing statistical bounds which has linear run time complexity. We prove the correctness of the proposed bounds. Since we provide both a lower and upper bound on the true statistical delay, we can determine the quality of the bounds. The proposed methods were implemented and tested on benchmark circuits. The results demonstrate that the proposed bounds have only a small error.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253588","","Benchmark testing;Circuit testing;Delay effects;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance analysis;Random variables;SPICE;Timing;Uncertainty;Upper bound","boundary-value problems;formal verification;integrated circuit design;logic design;logic simulation;statistical analysis;timing","IC verification;circuit reconverging paths;circuit size dependent run time complexity;circuit statistical delay definition;gate delay modeling;statistical bounds;statistical timing analysis;within-die process variation","","6","2","12","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extensible processors, which are increasingly popular in embedded system design, allow a designer to customize a base processor core through instruction set extensions. Existing processor energy macro-modeling techniques are not applicable to extensible processors, since they assume that the instruction set architecture as well as the underlying structural description of the microarchitecture remain fixed. Our solution to this problem is an energy macro-model suitably parameterized to estimate the energy consumption of a processor instance that incorporates any custom instruction extensions. Stich a characterization is facilitated by careful selection of macro-model parameters/variables that can capture both the functional and structural aspects of the execution of a program on an extensible processor Another feature of the proposed characterization flow is the use of regression analysis to build the macro-model. Regression analysis allows for in-situ characterization, thus allowing arbitrary test programs to be used during macro-model construction. We validate the proposed methodology by characterizing the energy consumption of a state-of-the-art extensible processor (Tensilica's Xtensa). We use the macro-model to analyze the energy consumption of several benchmark applications with custom instructions. The mean absolute error in the macro-model estimates is only 3.3%, when compared to the energy values obtained by a commercial tool operating on the synthesized RTL description of the custom processor. Our approach achieves an average speedup of three orders of magnitude over the commercial RTL energy estimator Our experiments show that the proposed methodology also achieves good relative accuracy, which is essential in energy Optimization studies.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253686","","Application specific integrated circuits;Benchmark testing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware;Microarchitecture;National electric code;Optimization methods;Parameter estimation;Regression analysis","embedded systems;high level synthesis;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;statistical analysis","base processor core;benchmark applications;characterization flow;embedded system design;energy consumption;energy estimation;extensible processors;in-situ characterization;instruction set extensions;mean absolute error;regression analysis;structural aspects;synthesized RTL description","","0","","25","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we investigate this interaction and propose a selective hardware/compiler strategy to optimize cache locality for integer numerical (array-intensive), and mixed codes. In our framework, the role of the compiler is to identify program regions that can be optimized at compile time using loop and data transformations and to mark (at compile-time) the unoptimizable regions with special instructions that activate/deactivate a hardware optimization mechanism selectively at run-time.

This paper presents a set of tools that optimise logic produced by the direct mapping technique by means of: exposure of outputs, detection and elimination of redundant places. Output exposure is an approach to explicitly model output signals as STG places, which can be directly mapped into output flip-flops. The STG can be simplified after output exposure. The detection of redundant places is a computationally hard problem with multiple solutions. The tool solves this problem by using several heuristics aimed at speed and size. All operations preserve behavioural equivalence. The efficiency of the overall algorithm and individual heuristics is analysed using a number of benchmarks.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253725","","Algorithm design and analysis;Asynchronous circuits;Circuit synthesis;Encoding;Flip-flops;Heuristic algorithms;Logic;Petri nets;Signal mapping;Signal synthesis","Petri nets;asynchronous circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;redundancy","Petri nets;STG optimisation;asynchronous circuits;behavioural equivalence;computationally hard problem;direct mapping;logic synthesis;output flip-flops;signal transition graphs","","2","","11","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, fragmented operations are executed over sets of several linked hardware resources. The implementations proposed by our algorithm need considerably smaller area than the ones proposed by conventional allocation algorithms.

The model enables fast simulation by native execution of application SW and OS. It gives simulation accuracy by timed SW and HW simulation. When building fast timed SW models, we need to solve two problems: (1) how to enable timing synchronization between the native execution and HW simulation and (2) how to obtain the portability of native execution (that needs multi-tasking from simulation environments to emulate its multi-tasking operation) on different simulation environments (that give different types of multi-tasking). In this paper, to enable the synchronization, we present a synchronization function. To enable the portability, we present an adaptation layer called simulation environment abstraction layer. We present our case studies in building fast timed SW models.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253666","","Application software;Buildings;Communication networks;Embedded system;Hardware;Performance evaluation;Software design;Testing;Time to market;Timing","circuit simulation;digital simulation;integrated circuit design;synchronisation;system-on-chip;timing","SW simulation models;SoC designs;fast timed SW model;hardware abstraction layer;portability;simulation environment abstraction layer;synchronization function;timing synchronization","","5","","15","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If these global wires are optimally segmented and buffered, their delay is linear in the path length and independent of the position of the modules along these paths. From timing requirements, the total budget left to modules after allocating the appropriate delay to the wires can be determined. This paper describes how this budget can be optimally divided amongst the modules. A novel, static timing-like, mathematical programming formulation is introduced such that the total module area is minimized. Instead of only the worst delay, all pin-to-pin delays are implicitly taken into account. If area-delay tradeoffs are convex, a reasonable approximation in practice, the program can be solved efficiently. Further, efficiency of different formulations is discussed, and a low-cost method of making the budget relatively immune to downstream uncertainties and surprises is presented. The efficiency of the formulation is clear from benchmarks with over 2000 nodes and 5e19 paths.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253648","","Delay lines;Design methodology;Mathematical programming;Productivity;Routing;System-on-a-chip;Timing;Uncertainty;Wires;Wiring","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;delays;integrated circuit layout;mathematical programming;minimisation;timing","area-delay tradeoffs;input-output paths;mathematical programming formulation;module area minimization;pin-to-pin delays;timing requirements;wireplanning","","0","","12","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semiconductors will play a key role to drive the technological evolution in the next 20 years. We already possess many of the technologies that will deeply change our scenario, among which we can mention nanotechnologies, bioelectronics, photonics. The central role of integrated circuits in the economy will grow stronger and stronger in the future, starting from the convergence between storage, security, video, audio, mobility and connectivity. Systems are converging and ICs are more and more converging with systems. The fundamental issue is how to translate knowledge and competence coming from different fields into single architectures. The key factor to win this challenge is to build the right culture.

Although this is the job of an optimizing compiler they do not succeed many a time due to limited knowledge of run-time data. In this paper, we examine the instruction reuse of an integer ALU and load instructions in network processing applications. Specifically, this paper attempts to answer the following questions: (1) how much instruction reuse is inherent in network processing applications?; (2) can reuse be improved by reducing interference in the reuse buffer?; (3) what characteristics of network applications can be exploited to improve reuse?; and (4) what is the effect of reuse on resource contention and memory accesses? We propose an aggregation scheme that combines the high-level concept of network traffic, i.e. ""flows"", with a low level microarchitectural feature of programs, i.e. repetition of instructions and data, along with an architecture that exploits temporal locality in incoming packet data to improve reuse. We find that for the benchmarks considered, 1% to 50% of instructions are reused while the speedup achieved varies between 1% and 24%. As a side effect, instruction reuse reduces memory traffic and can therefore be considered as a scheme for low power.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253702","","Computer aided instruction;Decoding;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Microarchitecture;Quality of service;Runtime;Supercomputers;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer architecture;digital arithmetic;logic design;logic simulation;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;packet switching;telecommunication congestion control","flow aggregation;instruction reuse;instruction/data repetition;integer ALU instructions;load instructions;low level microarchitectural features;memory accesses;multiprocessor systems;network processing speedup enhancement;network processor units;network traffic flows;optimizing compiler;packet data temporal locality;packet processing;redundant computation removal;resource contention;reuse buffer interference reduction","","0","","11","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed pipelined cache architecture can be accessed every clock cycle and, thereby, enhances bandwidth and overall processor performance. The proposed architecture utilizes the idea of banking to reduce bit-line and word-line delay, making word-line to sense amplifier delay fit into a single clock cycle. Experimental results show that optimal banking allows the cache to be split into multiple stages whose delays are equal to the clock cycle time. The proposed design is fully scalable and can be applied to future technology generations.

The application developer can then integrate the application code onto the SoC architecture as a set of SystemC modules.

We present an algorithm to generate a global wire bus configuration with minimum delay uncertainty under timing constraints. The timing window information from the timing budget (or specified in IPs) is integrated with modern accurate crosstalk noise models in the proposed algorithm. HSPICE simulations show that the algorithm is very effective and efficient when compared to the buffer insertion scheme with minimum delay. The standard deviation of the delay obtained from the Monte-Carlo simulation is improved by up to 73%. This global wire bus configuration can be adopted in early wire planning to improve the timing closure problem and increase the accuracy of the timing budget.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253586","","Delay;Uncertainty;Wire","Monte Carlo methods;circuit simulation;crosstalk;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;logic design;timing","Monte-Carlo simulation;buffer insertion scheme;coupling capacitance;crosstalk noise models;global wire bus configuration;high aspect ratio wires;minimum delay uncertainty;signal integrity;timing budget accuracy;timing closure;timing constraints;wire planning","","1","1","5","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we develop a formal specification of the AMBA protocol. We then employ model checking, a state space exploration based formal verification technique, to verify crucial design invariants. The presence of pipelining and split transfer in the AMBA protocol gives rise to interesting corner cases, which are hard to detect via informal reasoning.

From the benchmark experiments, we show that optimal performance and power tradeoff can be achieved by the selection of appropriate packet sizes.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253632","","Computer networks;Energy consumption;Multiprocessing systems;Network-on-a-chip;Parallel processing;Power system interconnection;Power system modeling;System-on-a-chip;Telecommunication traffic;Wire","cache storage;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;logic simulation;multiprocessor interconnection networks;packet switching;shared memory systems;system-on-chip","MPSoC power consumption;SoC performance;cache;circuit optimization;communication power model;multiprocessor interconnect networks;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;network packet dataflows;on-chip interconnect communication analysis;packet size;packetized communication;performance/power tradeoff;shared memory multiprocessor systems","","27","1","15","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, a design is composed of several parts, most of them available as RTL code, others, mainly memories, only as behavioral models. In this scenario, coemulation is necessary to verify the heterogeneous system descriptions, but this way most of the advantage of hardware emulation is lost. This paper presents a solution for modeling the analog array of a non volatile memory based on a VHDL synthesizable description. The presented approach relies on static RAMs and ROMs for which emulation models are assumed to be available. The adoption of a synthesizable model for the analog block makes possible the mapping of the entire design on the emulator thus exploiting its performance at full speed for efficient simulation sessions.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1186706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186706","","Acceleration;Context modeling;Discrete event simulation;Emulation;Hardware;Logic arrays;Macrocell networks;Nonvolatile memory;Read only memory;Silicon","SRAM chips;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic design;logic simulation;logic testing;read-only storage","ROM;RTL code;VHDL synthesizable description;behavioral models;hardware emulation;memory analog array modeling;nonvolatile memory macrocells;static RAM;system verification","","0","1","5","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many existing performance-directed retiming methods use simple delay models which either neglect routing delays or use inaccurate delay estimations. In this paper, we propose a retiming approach which overcomes the problem of inaccurate delay models. Our retiming technique uses delay information extracted from a fully placed and routed design and takes account of register timing requirements. By applying physical constraints, we ensure that the delay information remains valid during retiming.

Specifically, non-invasive attacks using power and timing measurements to extract the cryptographic key has drawn a lot of negative publicity for smart card usage. The power measurement techniques rely on the data-dependent energy behavior of the underlying system. Further, power analysis can be used to identify the specific portions of the program being executed to induce timing glitches that may in turn help to bypass key checking. Thus, it is important to mask the energy consumption when executing the encryption algorithms. In this work, we augment the instruction set architecture of a simple five-stage pipelined smart card processor with secure instructions to mask the energy differences due to key-related data-dependent computations in DES encryption. The secure versions operate on the normal and complementary versions of the operands simultaneously to mask the energy variations due to value dependent operations. However, this incurs the penalty of increased overall energy consumption in the data-path components. Consequently, we employ secure versions of instructions only for critical operations; that is we use secure instructions selectively, as directed by an optimizing compiler. Using a cycle-accurate energy simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this enhancement. Our approach achieves the energy masking of critical operations consuming 83% less energy as compared to existing approaches employing dual rail circuits.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253591","","Circuit simulation;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Optimizing compilers;Power measurement;Rails;Smart cards;Timing","cryptography;instruction sets;logic design;logic simulation;microprocessor chips;optimising compilers;pipeline processing;smart cards","DES encryption energy behavior masking;cryptographic key extraction;data-dependent energy behavior;data-path component energy consumption;energy consumption masking;instruction set architecture;invasive attacks;key checking bypass;key-related data dependent computations;noninvasive attacks;optimizing compiler;pipelined smart card processor;power analysis attack;power measurements;secure instructions;selective secure instruction use;smart cards;timing glitches;timing measurements","","25","3","17","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among these blocks, frequency-translating devices such as mixers pose problems in RF circuit simulation since their response typically covers a mix of long- and short-time scales. This paper proposes a technique to analyze and model nonlinear frequency-translating RF circuits such as up- and downconversion mixers. The proposed method is based on a generalized Volterra series approach for periodically time-varying systems. It enables a multi-tone distortion analysis starting from a circuit description and derives simplified high-level models based on the most important nonlinear contributions.

In this paper we present a new exact branch & bound technique for determining an optimal variable order In contrast to all previous approaches, that only considered one lower bound, our method makes use of a combination of three bounds and by this avoids unnecessary computations.

Focus is given to PLLs with sampling phase-frequency detectors (PFDs) which compute the phase error only once per period of the reference signal. Using the harmonic transfer matrix (HTM) formalism, the well known continuous-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) approximations are extended to take the impact of time-varying behavior arising from the sampling nature of the PFD, into account. Especially for PLLs with a fast feedback loop, this time-varying behavior has severe impact on, for example, loop stability and cannot be neglected. Contrary to LTI analysis, our method is able to predict and quantify these difficulties. The method is verified for a typical loop design.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1186392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186392","","Feedback loop;Frequency domain analysis;Frequency synthesizers;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Power harmonic filters;Sampling methods;Stability;Voltage-controlled oscillators","circuit feedback;circuit stability;frequency-domain analysis;harmonic analysis;invariance;network analysis;phase detectors;phase locked loops;time-varying networks","HTM formalism;LTI approximations;PFD phase error computation;PLL small-signal behavior;continuous-time linear time-invariant approximations;fast feedback loop;frequency-domain analysis;harmonic transfer matrix;loop stability;phase-locked loop analysis;sampling phase-frequency detectors;time-varying frequency-domain modeling","","0","","10","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a multiprocessor based turbo-decoder implementation where inherently parallel decoding tasks are mapped onto individual processing nodes.

In this paper we propose a new technique that leads to the transient solution of charge/discharge paths with a complexity equivalent to only K DC operating point calculations, where K is the number of transistors along the path. This is accomplished by approximating each nodal voltage as a piecewise quadratic waveform, whose characteristics can be determined by matching the charge/discharge currents.

This declarative model allows for direct synthesis of micro-architecture simulators as it encapsulates precise concurrency semantics of microprocessors. We illustrate the practical benefits of this model through two case studies - the StrongARM core and the PowerPC-750 superscalar processor The experimental results demonstrate that the OSM model has excellent modeling productivity and model efficiency.

Uniformity of chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) requires the insertion of area fill features into the layout, in order to smoothen the variation of feature densities across the die and thus improve manufacturability. Because the size of area fill features is very small compared with the large empty layout areas that must be filled, the filling process can increase the size of a GDSII file by an order of magnitude or more. Data compression is therefore a significant issue in successful fill synthesis. In this paper, we introduce compressed fill strategies which exploit the GDSII array reference record (AREF) construct.

This paper shows that MV algebraic operations are essentially as easy as binary ones, with only a slight overhead (linear in the size of the expression) in transformation into and out of the binary domain. By introducing co-singleton sets as a new basis, any MV sum-of-products expression can be rewritten and passed to a binary logic synthesizer for fast execution; the optimized results can be directly interpreted in the MV domain. This process, called EBD, reduces MV algebraic operations, to binary. A pure MV operation differs mainly from its corresponding EBD one in that the former possesses ""semi-algebraic"" generality, which has not been implemented for the binary logic.

In this paper, we explore transport protocol optimizations for reducing the energy consumption of wireless LAN interfaces. Our work is based on the observation that, the transport protocol, which implements flow control to regulate the network traffic, plays a significant role in determining the workload of the network interface. Hence, by monitoring run-time parameters in the transport protocol, coarse-granularity idle periods, which present the best opportunities for network interface power reduction, can be accurately identified.

While errors may affect more than one state/output bit, not all combinations of state/output bits constitute potential erroneous cases for a given fault model. Therefore, it is possible to compact them without loss of error information. Thus, concurrent error detection is performed through hardware that predicts the values of the compacted state/output bits and compares them to the actual values of the FSM. In order to minimize the incurred hardware overhead, a randomized algorithm is proposed for selecting the minimum number of required parity functions.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253783","","Circuit faults;Clocks;Compaction;Delay;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Hardware;Linear programming;Logic;Monitoring","condition monitoring;error detection;finite state machines","FSM;nonintrusive concurrent error detection;parity functions;parity trees;randomized algorithm;state/output bits compaction;state/output bits monitoring","","1","","11","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops a novel and efficient transient simulation algorithm for the power distribution networks. The 3D TLM-ADI (Transmission-Line-Modeling Alternating-Direction-Implicit) method, first models the power delivery structure as a three dimensional transmission line shunt node structure and transfers those equations to the Telegraph equation. Finally, we solve it by the alternating direction implicit method. The 3D TLM-ADI method, with linear runtime and memory requirement, is also unconditionally stable which ensures that the time-steps are not limited by any stability requirement. Numerical experimental results show that the 3D TLM-ADI method is not only over 300,000 times faster than SPICE but also extremely memory saving and accurate.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253738","","Analytical models;Clocks;Energy consumption;Equations;Frequency;Power grids;Power system transients;Robustness;Transient analysis;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit simulation;monolithic integrated circuits;numerical stability;power supply circuits;transient analysis;transmission line theory","3D TLM-ADI method;3D alternating-direction-implicit method;3D transmission line shunt node structure;Ldi/dt drop;Telegraph equation;VLSI technology;chip power distribution networks;dynamic IR drop;large scale power delivery structures;linear runtime;power delivery fluctuation;power grid transient simulation;transmission-line modeling","","3","","16","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A switching event on a row select line often consumes significantly more energy in comparison to a switching event on a column select line. In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel data layout method that aims to minimize row switching activity by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of minimum row switching data layout has been formulated as a multi-way mesh partitioning problem. The constraints imposed on the problem formulation ensure that the complexity of the address generator required to implement the optimized data layout is bounded and that the data layout optimization can be applied to all address generator synthesis methods.

Compilation of behavioral descriptions (in, e.g., C, Java, etc.), apart from mapping the computational structures onto the available resources on the device, must split the program in temporal sections if it needs more resources than physically available. In addition, since the execution of the computational structures in a configuration needs at least two stages (i.e., configuring and computing), it is important to split the program such that the reconfiguration overheads are minimized, taking advantage of the overlapping of the execution stages on different configurations. This paper presents mapping techniques to cope with those features. The techniques are being researched in the context of a C compiler for the eXtreme Processing Platform (XPP). Temporal partitioning is applied to furnish a set of configurations that reduces the reconfiguration overhead and thus may lead to performance gains. We also show that when applications include a sequence of loops, the use of several configurations may be more beneficial than the mapping of the entire application onto a single configuration. Preliminary results for a number of benchmarks strongly confirm the approach.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253670","","Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Java;Paper technology;Performance gain;Physics computing;Reconfigurable architectures;Runtime","C language;circuit CAD;high level synthesis;microprocessor chips;program compilers;reconfigurable architectures","C compiler;behavioral description compilation;configure-execute paradigm;extreme processing platform;mapping techniques;reconfiguration overheads;run-time reconfigurable architectures;temporal partitioning","","5","","15","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Chromatic encoding reduces power consumption by minimizing the transition counts on the DVI. This technique relies on the notion of tonal locality, i.e., the observation that the signal differences between adjacent pixels in images follow a Gaussian distribution. Based on this observation, an optimal code assignment is performed to minimize the transition counts. Furthermore, the three color channels of the DVI may be reciprocally encoded to achieve even more power saving. The idea is that given the signal values from the three color channels, one or two of these channels are encoded by reciprocal differences with a number of redundant bits used to indicate the selection. The proposed technique requires only three redundant bits for each 24-bit pixel.

Thus, the software can be executed while it is being streamed instead of causing the user to wait for the completion of download, decompression, installation and reconfiguration. Our streaming method can reduce application load time seen by the user since the application can start running as soon as the first executable unit is loaded into the memory. Furthermore, unneeded parts of the application might not be downloaded to the device. As a result, resource utilization such as memory and bandwidth usage may also be more efficient. Using our streaming method, an embedded device can support a wide range of realtime applications. The applications can be run on demand. In this paper, a streaming method we call block streaming is proposed. Block streaming is determined at the assembly code level. We implemented a tool to partition real-time software into parts which can be transmitted (streamed) to the embedded device. Our streaming method was implemented and simulated on a hardware-software co-simulation platform in which we used the PowerPC architecture. We show a robotics application that without our streaming method is unable to meet its real-time deadline. However, with our software streaming method, the application is able to meet its deadline. The application load time for this application also improves by a factor of more than 10× when compared to downloading the entire application before running it.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253722","","Application software;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Delay;Embedded software;Hardware;Resource management;Robotic assembly;Robots;Software tools","digital simulation;embedded systems;program compilers;real-time systems;robots;software performance evaluation","PowerPC architecture;application load time;assembly code level;bandwidth usage;block streaming;embedded device;hardware/software co-simulation platform;memory usage;real-time applications;resource utilization;robotics application;software streaming;stream-enabled software","","11","2","16","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To increase the maximum tolerable load of the network, we propose a proximity congestion awareness (PCA) technique, where switches use the load information of neighbouring switches, called stress values, for their own switching decisions, thus avoiding congested areas.

Previous research proposed an ILP-based solution to this problem that is based on exhaustive evaluation of each nest under all possible processor sizes.

Today, it is widely accepted that caches improve significantly the performance of programs, since most of the programs exhibit temporal and/or spatial locality in their memory reference patterns. However conflict misses can be a major obstacle preventing an application from utilizing the data cache effectively. While array padding can reduce conflict misses it can also increase the data space requirements significantly. In this paper, we present a compiler-based data transformation strategy, called the ""generalized data transformations,"" for reducing inter-array conflict misses in embedded applications. We present the theory behind the generalized data transformations and discuss how they can be integrated with compiler-based loop transformations.

A DES-based cryptography system was implemented as a case study.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253726","","Application software;Computer applications;Consumer electronics;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Emulation;Hardware;Microelectronics;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing","cryptography;middleware;reconfigurable architectures;ubiquitous computing","API level;DES-based cryptography system;Jini-based infrastructure;client applications;implementation issues;reconfigurable hardware modules;ubiquitous reconfigurable computing","","4","2","15","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Behavioral modeling and simulation of a mixed analog/digital automatic gain control loop in a 5 GHz WLAN receiver","Eberle, W.; Vandersteen, Gerd; Wambacq, P.; Donnay, S.; Gielen, G.; De Man, H.","IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 2003","20031219","2003","","","642","647","Wireless LAN (WLAN), operating in the 5-6 GHz range, become commercially viable only if they can be produced at low cost. Consequently, tight integration of the physical layer, consisting of the radio front-end and the digital signal processing part, is a must. Especially with respect to mixed-signal feedback loops, with automatic gain control as a recurring example, existing tools have major difficulties in offering efficient ways of modeling and simulation. We present a modeling approach where the complexity of the analog behavioral model has been reduced to the minimum required by the digital receiver, namely its steady-state responses and a 'worst-case' time delay. Moreover, we show how this mixed-signal receiver model can be used in an end-to-end communication link simulation to provide the designer insight into statistical information such as transient delays and gain tolerances. For this model, we set up a co-simulation of two existing in-house tools, one for the analog part, the other for the digital system part.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253680","","Costs;Delay effects;Digital signal processing;Digital systems;Feedback loop;Gain control;Physical layer;Receivers;Steady-state;Wireless LAN","automatic gain control;circuit simulation;feedback amplifiers;integrated circuit modelling;microwave amplifiers;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;radio receivers;wireless LAN","5 to 6 GHz;WLAN receiver;automatic gain control loop;digital signal processing;gain tolerances;mixed analog/digital AGC;mixed-signal AGC feedback loop;radio front-end;steady-state responses;transient delays;variable-gain amplifiers;wireless LAN;worst-case time delay model","","4","","13","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Design of safety critical systems by refinement","Iliasov, A.; Alekseyev, A.; Sokolov, D.; Mokhov, A.","Newcastle Univ., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","4","An increasingly large number of safety-critical embedded systems rely on software to prevent and mitigate hazards occurring due to design errors and unexpected interactions of the system with its users and the environment. Implementing a safety instrumented function in the way advocated by the traditional software methods requires an intimate understanding and thorough validation of a complex ecosystem of programming languages, compilers, operating systems and hardware. We propose to consider an alternative where a system designer, for each individual problem, creates in a correct-by-construction manner both the design of a system and its compilation and execution infrastructure. This permits an uninterrupted chain of a formal correctness argument spanning from formalised requirements all the way to the gate-level characterisation of an execution environment. The past decade of advances in verification technology turned the mechanical verification of large-scale models into a reality while the pressure of certification makes the cost of a formally verified development routine increasingly acceptable. The proposal fits the Grand Challenge for Computer Research posed by Hoare in 2003, namely, development of a Verifying Compiler which not only mechanically translates a given program from one language to another but also verifies its correctness according to a formal specification. This allows meeting the most stringent software certification requirements such as SIL 4. We illustrate the vision with a small case-study developed using the Event-B modelling notation and tools.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800301","","Abstracts;Biological system modeling;Concrete;Hardware;Registers;Software;Virtual machining","embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification;operating systems (computers);program compilers;programming languages;safety-critical software","event-B modelling notation;execution infrastructure;formal correctness argument;formal specification;gate-level characterisation;hazard mitigation;large-scale models;mechanical verification technology;operating systems;programming languages;safety critical system design;safety instrumented function;safety-critical embedded systems;software certification;verifying compiler","","0","","7","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, we proposed a technique based on clustering and reordering of scan cells that allows to design low power scan chains according to Y. Bonhomme et al. (2003). The main feature of this technique is that power consumption during scan testing is minimized while constraints on scan routing are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a new version of this technique. The clustering process has been modified to allow a better distribution of scan cells in each cluster and hence lead to more important power reductions. Results are provided at the end of the paper to highlight this point and show that scan design constraints (length of scan connections, congestion problems) are still satisfied.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268828","","Automatic testing;Circuit testing;Degradation;Design for testability;Energy consumption;Integrated circuit testing;Robots;Routing;System testing;Uniform resource locators","boundary scan testing;circuit layout CAD;cluster tools;low-power electronics","clustering;congestion problems;power consumption;reordering;routing-constrained low power scan chains;scan cells;scan connections;scan design constraints;scan routing;scan testing;scan-based architectures","","19","3","24","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Design closure becomes hard to achieve at physical layout stage due to the emergence of long global interconnects. Consequently, interconnect planning needs to be integrated in high level synthesis. Delay relaxation that assigns extra clock latencies to functional resources at RTL (register transfer level) can be leveraged. This paper proposed a general formulation for design closure driven delay relaxation problem. The authors show that the general formulation can be transformed into a convex cost integer dual network flow problem and solved in polynomial time using the convex cost-scaling algorithm in (Ahuja et al., 2003). Experimental results validate the efficiency of the approach","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211773","","Clocks;Costs;Delay;Design automation;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit interconnections;Pipeline processing;Polynomials;Registers;Timing","high level synthesis;integrated circuit interconnections;relaxation","convex cost network flow;design closure;driven delay relaxation;global interconnects;high level synthesis;interconnect planning;polynomial time;register transfer level","","2","","17","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","468","473 Vol.1","Driven by the economics of design and manufacturing nanoscale integrated circuits, an emphasis is being placed on developing new, regular logic fabrics that leverage the regularity and programmability of FPGAs, yet deliver a level of performance and density close to ASICs. One example of such a fabric is a Via-Patterned Gate Array (VPGA) according to Pillegi et al. (2002), which employs ASIC style global routing on top of an array of patternable logic blocks (PLBs). Previous works (Koorapaty et al., 2003; Koorapaty, 2003; Pileggi et al., 2003) showed that by employing even limited heterogeneity for the VPGA logic blocks, namely combining a 3-LUT with two 3-input Nand gates, one can achieve performance comparable to that provided by standard cells. Since the area cost for such heterogeneity id far less for FPGAs, we can explore new configurations of via-configurable logic blocks that offer greater heterogeneity and granularity to achieve even higher performance. In this paper, we present a new, more granular, via-patterned heterogeneous logic block architecture and compare it to a less granular LUT-based heterogeneous PLB. Our results show higher performance and more effective packing of the logic functions due to increased granularity.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268890","","Application specific integrated circuits;Costs;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit manufacture;Logic arrays;Logic circuits;Logic design;Programmable logic arrays;Routing","application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;logic circuits;logic design;logic gates","3-LUT;3-input Nand gates;ASIC;FPGA;VPGA logic blocks;application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;logic block granularity;logic functions;nanoscale integrated circuits;patternable logic blocks;regular logic fabrics;via-configurable logic blocks;via-patterned gate array","","10","127","11","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
