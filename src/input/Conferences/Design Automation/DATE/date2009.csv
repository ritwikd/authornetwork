With the rapid development of semiconductor memories, their test is becoming a major concern in VDSM technologies. It provides information about the SRAM design reliability, and its effectiveness is therefore mandatory for safety applications. Existing core-cell stability design-for-test (DfT) techniques consist in controlling the voltage levels of bit lines to apply a weak write stress on the core-cell under test. If the core-cell is weak, the weak write stress induces the faulty swap of the core-cell. However, these solutions are costly in terms of area and test application time, and generally require modifications of critical parts of the SRAM (core-cell array and/or the structure generating the internal auto-timing). In this paper, we present a new DfT technique for stability fault detection. It consists in modulating the word line activation in order to perform an adjustable weak write stress on the targeted core-cell for stability fault detection. Compared to existing DfT solutions, the proposed technique offers many advantages: programmability, low area overhead, low test application time. Moreover, it does not require any modification of critical parts of the SRAM.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090873","","Design for testability;Fault detection;Maintenance;Random access memory;Stability;Stress control;System-on-a-chip;Testing;Uniform resource locators;Voltage","SRAM chips;circuit stability;design for testability;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing","DfT technique;SRAM core-cell stability faults;SRAM design reliability;VDSM technologies;design-for-test technique;low-test application time;semiconductor memories;stability fault detection","","4","","14","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, while a lot of focus has been put on research fundamentals, extremely few applications in industry have been reported so far. Therefore, a group including Infineon Technologies as a leading semiconductor IDM and various universities and research institutes, as well as an EDA provider has tackled key challenges to enable statistical design in industry in a publicly funded project called ldquoSigma65rdquo. Sigma65 strives to provide key foundations to allow a change from traditional deterministic design methods to future design methods driven by statistical considerations. The project starts with statistical modeling and optimization of library components and ranges to statistical techniques for designing ICs on gate level and higher levels. In this paper, we present some results of this project, demonstrating how the interaction between industrial perspective, research institutions and EDA provider enables solutions which are applicable already in the near future. After an overview of the industrial perspective of the current situation in dealing with variations recent results on both statistical timing and power analysis will be given.

"Selective state retention design using symbolic simulation","Darbari, A.; Al Hashimi, B.M.; Flynn, D.; Biggs, J.","Sch. of Electron. & Comput.

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","1644","1649","Addressing both standby and active power is a major challenge in developing system-on-chip designs for battery-powered products. Powering off sections of logic or memories loses internal register and RAM states so designers have to weigh up the benefits and costs of implementing state retention on some or all of the power gated subsystems where state recovery has significant real-time or energy cost, compared to resetting the subsystem and re-acquiring state from scratch. Library IP and EDA tools can support state retention in hardware synthesized from standard RTL, but due to the silicon area costs there is strong interest in only retaining certain selective state for example the ldquoarchitectural staterdquo of a CPU to implement sleep modes. Currently there is no known rigourous technique for checking the integrity of selective state retention, and this is due to the complexity of checking that the correctness of the design is not compromised in any way. The complexity is exacerbated due to the interaction between the retained and the non-retained state, and exhaustive simulation rapidly becomes infeasible. This paper presents a case study based on symbolic simulation for assisting the designers to design and implement selective retention correctly. The main finding of our study is that the programmer visible state or the architectural state of the CPU needs to be implemented using retention registers whilst other micro-architectural enhancements such as pipeline registers, TLBs and caches can be implemented using normal registers without retention. This has a profound impact on power and area savings for chip design. By selectively retaining the state of the programmer's ldquoarchitecturalrdquo model and not the increasing proportion of extra state, one can incorporate energy-efficient sleep modes. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in the area of rigourous design and implementation of selective state retention.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090927","","Costs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware;Libraries;Logic design;Product design;Programming profession;Random access memory;Registers;System-on-a-chip","circuit complexity;circuit simulation;logic design;random-access storage;system-on-chip","RAM;energy cost;energy-efficient sleep modes;microarchitectural enhancement;pipeline registers;power gated subsystems;programmer architectural model;selective state retention design;symbolic simulation;system-on-chip designs","","4","","13","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of recent works have focused on adaptive post-fabrication tuning approaches to mitigate this problem. Adaptive Body Bias (ABB) is one of the most successful tuning ldquoknobsrdquo in use today in high-performance custom design. Through forward body bias (FBB), the threshold voltage of the CMOS devices can be reduced after fabrication to bring the slow dies back to within the range of acceptable specs. FBB is usually applied with a very coarse core-level granularity at the price of a significantly increased leakage power. In this paper, we propose a novel, physically clustered FBB scheme on row-based standard-cell layout style that enables selective forward body biasing of only of the rows that contain most timing critical gates, thereby reducing leakage power overhead. We propose exact and heuristic algorithms to partition the design and allocate optimal body bias voltages to achieve minimum leakage power overhead. This style is fully compatible with state-of-the-art commercial physical design flows and imposes minimal area blowup. Benchmark results show large leakage power savings with a maximum savings of 30% in case of 5% compensation and 47.6% in case of 10% compensation with respect to block-level FBB and minimal implementation area overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090650","","Aging;Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Clustering algorithms;Delay;Fabrication;Forward contracts;Temperature;Threshold voltage;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;integrated circuit design;leakage currents;nanoelectronics","NMOS transistor;adaptive body bias;adaptive postfabrication tuning approach;circuit variability;coarse core-level granularity;heuristic algorithm;high-performance custom design;leakage power reduction;nanometer CMOS device design;nanometer CMOS scaling;optimal body bias voltage;physically clustered FBB scheme;physically clustered forward body biasing;row-based standard cell layout style;selective forward body biasing;state-of-the-art commercial physical design;threshold voltage;variability compensation","","7","","14","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a generic framework for reducing scan capture power in test compression environment. Using the entropy of the test set to measure the impact of capture power-aware X-filling on the potential test compression ratio, the proposed holistic solution is able to keep capture power under a safe limit with little compression ratio loss for any fixed-length symbol-based TDC method.

Current tools typically use a library of components that reflect an explicit representation of the underlying FPGA device features. This is undesirable since the designer is forced to mix implementation and architecture, and leads to long design cycles and non-portable results. This paper shows that introducing techniques of high level synthesis allows a more elegant design at a higher level of abstraction. This results in fewer components needed for a design which translates into a faster design cycle, more portable designs and fewer defects. Pushbutton clock frequencies of up to 500 MHz are achieved without detailed knowledge of FPGA architectures. Although the capabilities described are embodied in the DSP Builder tool from Altera, this paper describes the technology involved rather than the details of the tools. Four major technologies are described: a latency-insensitive system representation, the module level internal representation with associated transformations, hardware retiming, and lastly a FIR filter design tool layered on top.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090845","FIR Filter Design;FPGAs;High Level Synthesis;Model Based Design;Retiming;Technology Mapping","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Digital signal processing;Feedback;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Hardware;High level synthesis;Libraries;Productivity","FIR filters;data flow graphs;digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis;integer programming","DSP Builder tool;FIR filter design tool;FPGA device;associated transformations;data flow graph;hardware retiming;high level synthesis;integer linear programming;latency-insensitive system representation;model based electronic design;module level internal representation;pushbutton clock frequency","","2","","8","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the absence of a single module interface standard, integration of pre-designed modules often requires the use of protocol converters. For an arbitrary pair of incompatible protocols it is likely that there exist more than one possible converter. However, existing approaches to automatic synthesis of protocol converters either produce a single suggested converter or provide a general nondeterministic solution, out of which a designer is required to extract a deterministic converter. In this work we present a novel approach for design space exploration of FSM based protocol converters. We present algorithms for extraction of minimal converters for a given pair of incompatible protocols. We demonstrate the process through a simple example, and report on results of experiments with converters for commercial protocols AMBA ASB, APB and the open core protocol (OCP). The experiments show a reduction in the number of states in the converter of as much as 62% (with an average reduction of 42%) and a reduction in the number of transitions of as much as 85% (with an average reduction of 61%), demonstrating the benefits of design space exploration.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090645","","Australia;Buffer storage;Communication standards;Computer science;Design engineering;Design methodology;Hardware;Protocols;Space exploration;Time to market","microprocessor chips;protocols","AMBA ASB;APB;FSM;chip architecture;chip design;design space exploration;formal approach;hardware module reuse;module interface standard;open core protocol;protocol converters","","1","","15","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But, in contrast to simulation-based methods, like random testing, formal verification requires a detailed knowledge of the design implementation. Finding the correct set of properties is a tedious and time consuming process. In this paper, two techniques are presented that provide automatic support for writing properties in a quality-driven BMC flow. The first technique can be used to analyze properties in order to remove redundant assumptions and to separate different scenarios. The second technique - inverse property checking - automatically generates valid properties for a given expected behavior. The techniques are integrated with a coverage check for BMC. Using the presented techniques, the number of iterations to obtain full coverage can be reduced, saving time and effort.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090855","","Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Circuits and systems;Computer science;Design automation;Design engineering;Design methodology;Formal verification;Hardware;Writing","circuit analysis computing;network synthesis","automatic support;bounded model checking;design implementation;inverse property checking;property analysis;quality-driven BMC flow","","0","","23","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We select the most effective patterns from a large N-detect pattern repository, and guarantee a small test set as well as complete stuck-at coverage. Simulation results for benchmark circuits show that with a compact, 1-detect stuck-at test set, the proposed method provides considerably higher transition-fault coverage and coverage ramp-up compared to another recently-published method. Moreover, in all cases, the proposed method either outperforms or is as effective as the competing approach in terms of bridging-fault coverage and the surrogate BCE+ metric. In many cases, higher transition-fault coverage is obtained than much larger N-detect test sets for several values of N. Finally, our results provide the insight that, instead of using N-detect testing with as large N as possible, it is more efficient to combine the output deviations metric with multi-detect testing to get high-quality, compact test sets.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090833","","Application software;Automatic test pattern generation;Automatic testing;Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Computer science;Fault detection","fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;quality management","1-detect stuck-at test set;N-detect pattern repository;N-detect testing;benchmark circuits;multidetect testing;pattern-quality metric;surrogate BCE+ metric;transition-fault coverage","","5","","19","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This conceptual integration, however, poses several challenges when moved to industrial design flows. Although both clock and power-gating are supported by most commercial synthesis tools, their combined implementation requires some flexibility in the back-end tools that is not currently available. This paper presents a layout-oriented synthesis flow which integrates the two techniques and that relies on leading-edge, commercial EDA tools.

The development of a satisfactory Embedded Systems Design Science provides a timely challenge and opportunity for reinvigorating Computer Science. Embedded systems are components integrating software and hardware jointly and specifically designed to provide given functionalities, which are often critical. They are used in many applications areas including transport, consumer electronics and electrical appliances, energy distribution, manufacturing systems etc. Embedded systems design requires techniques taking into account extra-functional requirements regarding optimal use of resources such as time, memory and energy while ensuring autonomy, reactivity and robustness. Jointly taking into account these requirements raises a grand scientific and technical challenge extending Computer Science with paradigms and methods from Control Theory and Electrical Engineering. Computer Science is based on discrete computation models not encompassing physical time and resources which are by their nature very different from analytic models used by other engineering disciplines. We summarise some current trends in embedded systems design and point out some of their characteristics, such as the chasm between analytical and computational models and the gap between safety critical and best-effort engineering practices. We call for a coherent scientific foundation for embedded systems design, and we discuss a few key demands on such a foundation: the need for encompassing several manifestations of heterogeneity, and the need for design paradigms ensuring constructivity and adaptivity.

Due to the design limitations of using expensive cooling solutions, such complex chip multiprocessors require an architectural solution to mitigate thermal problems. Many of the current systems deploy Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to address thermal emergencies, either within the Operating System or hardware. These techniques have certain limitations in terms of response lag, scalability, cost and being reactive. In this paper, we present an alternative thermal management system to address these limitations, based on hardware/software co-design architecture.

In this paper, a new LFSR-based compression approach that overcomes this problem is proposed. The proposed method allows each LFSR seed to encode as many slices as possible. For achieving this, a special purpose slice, called stop-slice, that indicates the end of a seed's usage is encoded as the last slice of each seed. Thus, the seeds include by construction the information of where they should stop and, for that reason, we call them self-stoppable. A stop-slice generation procedure is proposed that exploits the inherent test set characteristics and generates stop slices which impose minimum compression overhead. Moreover, the architecture for implementing the proposed technique requires negligible additional hardware overhead compared to the standard LFSR-based architecture.

In this paper, we perform a detailed study on the thermal behavior of a low-power value-aware register file (VARF) that is subjected to internal fine-grain hotspots. To further optimize its thermal behavior, we propose and evaluate three thermal-aware control schemes, thermal sensor (TS), access counter (AC), and register-id (ID) based, to balance the access activity and thus the temperature across different partitions in the VARF. The simulation results using SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks show that the register-id controlled VARF (ID-VARF) scheme achieves optimized thermal behavior at minimum cost as compared to the other schemes. We further evaluate the performance impact of the thermal-aware VARF design with the dynamic thermal management (DTM). The experimental results show that the ID-VARF can improve the performance by 26.1% and 7.2% over the conventional register file and the original VARF design, respectively.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090887","","Counting circuits;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Registers;Temperature control;Temperature sensors;Thermal engineering;Thermal management;Thermal sensors","microprocessor chips;thermal management (packaging)","access counter;dynamic thermal management;fine grain hotspot;high performance microprocessor;integer register file;low power value aware register file;narrow width value;thermal aware control;thermal aware register file design;thermal sensor","","4","","53","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) has emerged as a promising solution to meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIP design tailored for FFT computation. We reconstruct the FFT computation flow into a scalable array structure based on an 8-point butterfly unit (BU). Any-point FFT computation can be carried out in the array structure which can easily expand along both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. We incorporate custom register files to reduce memory access. The data address for custom registers in each FFT stage is changed accordingly, and we derive a regular address changing (AC) rule. With the microarchitecture modifications, we extend the instruction set with three custom instructions correspondingly. Our FFT ASIP implementation achieves great performance improvement over the standard FFT software implementation, one TI DSP processor, and one commercial Xtensa ASIP, with the data throughput improvement as 866.5X, 5.9X, 2.3X, respectively.

The key challenges are to avoid resource sharing between modular redundant operations and also to reduce the possibility of TMR masking breaches in resource allocation. We introduce the notion of vulnerability gap during resource sharing to potentially reduce the effort for white space allocation at the physical design stage in order to avoid bridging faults between TMR resources.

Thirdly, it is desirable that the resulting integration is correct-by-construction, i.e., the resulting SoC satisfies given system-level specifications. All of these issues have been studied extensively, although not in a unifying manner. In this paper we propose a framework based on protocol conversion that addresses all these issues.

With power now the first-order design constraint, early-stage estimation of NoC power has become crucially important. ORION was amongst the first NoC power models released, and has since been fairly widely used for early-stage power estimation of NoCs. However, when validated against recent NoC prototypes - the Intel 80-core Teraflops chip and the Intel scalable communications core (SCC) chip - we saw significant deviation that can lead to erroneous NoC design choices. This prompted our development of ORION 2.0, an extensive enhancement of the original ORION models which includes completely new subcomponent power models, area models, as well as improved and updated technology models. Validation against the two Intel chips confirms a substantial improvement in accuracy over the original ORION. A case study with these power models plugged within the COSI-OCC NoC design space exploration tool confirms the need for, and value of, accurate early-stage NoC power estimation. To ensure the longevity of ORION 2.0, we will be releasing it wrapped within a semi-automated flow that automatically updates its models as new technology files become available.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090700","","Aerospace industry;Bandwidth;Design optimization;Fabrics;Integrated circuit interconnections;Network-on-a-chip;Predictive models;Space exploration;Space technology;Textile industry","circuit analysis computing;integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;network-on-chip","Intel 80-core Teraflops chip;Intel scalable communications core chip;NoC power models;early-stage power estimation;networks-on-chip;stage design space exploration","","171","","40","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The enforcement of strict governmental regulations and international standards, mainly (but not only) in the automotive domain, are driving new efforts towards design solutions for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Hence, EMC/EMI is rapidly becoming a major concern for high-speed circuit and package designers. The on-chip power rail noise is one of the most detrimental sources of electromagnetic (EM) conducted emissions, since it propagates to the board through the power and ground I/O pads. In this work we investigate the impact of power rail noise on EMI, and we show that by limiting this noise source it is possible to drastically reduce the conducted emissions. Furthermore, we present a transistor-level lumped-element simulation model of the system power distribution network (PDN) that allows chip, package, and board designers to asses the power integrity and predict the conducted emissions at critical chip I/O pads.

This assumption leads to the well known Software Defined Radio concept which enables the implementation and the deployment of different waveforms on the same platform. This concept has been widely investigated since the early 2000's mainly for processors and Sw approach but less for reconfigurable Hw or DSP implementation. This paper deals with a specific architecture and an innovative design methodology which were designed within the framework of a fully flexible high data rate Software Defined Radio wireless modem. This approach is focused on the waveform part of the system and its goal is to reach a fully flexible physical layer. In case of modem evolutions or upgrades, it enables to avoid significant rework and extra cost in term of waveform development. Moreover the association of the right architecture and the right methodology allows to master and to manage the complexity of the modem (which presents several hundred configurations available with different kind of parameters) and permits to provide the needed flexibility. The development methodology is based on a C/C++ approach which allows to manage all the parameters at a system level. The architecture coupled to this development methodology offers a high level of modularity which enables to easily modify the waveform only in replacing blocks by other blocks.

We implemented our design using three modules: the dependency controller, which controls dependencies among threads, the thread pool, which manages the ready threads, and the thread dispatcher, which fetches threads from the pool and executes them on the core. Our design and implementation provide efficient thread scheduling with low overhead. Moreover, by hiding the actual number of cores, it realizes transparency. We confirmed the transparency and scalability of our scheme by applying it to the H.264 decoder program.

The power behavior of a block is related to the applications run on the system while the heat dissipating ability is determined by the number of tier and the position the block locates. Therefore, a thermal-aware memory allocator should consider the following two points. First, allocator should consider not only the power behavior of a memory block but also the physical location during memory mapping, second, the changing temperature of a physical block during execution of programs. In this paper, we will propose a memory mapping algorithm taking into consideration the above-mentioned two points.

We show that this preprocessing is feasible and quick, and requires minimal FPGA resources, while achieving a significant reduction in the size of the database that needs to be processed by BLAST. We also determine the parameters under which prefiltering is guaranteed to identify the same set of solutions as the original NCBI software. We model our preprocessor in VHDL and implement it in reconfigurable architecture. To evaluate the performance, we use a large set of datasets and compare against the original (NCBI) software. Prefiltering is able to determine that between 80 and 99.9% of the database will not produce matches and can be safely ignored.

A simultaneous identification of numerous frequency domain Volterra kernels is enabled, and thus, to test the compliance to data sheet specifications.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090930","","Baseband;Distortion measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Kernel;Low pass filters;NIST;Nonlinear filters;Radio frequency;System testing;Transceivers","Volterra series;cascade networks;digital-analogue conversion;frequency-domain analysis;low-pass filters;nonlinear systems","Volterra series;digital-to-analog converter;frequency domain Volterra kernel;linear model-based diagnosis;linear model-based testing;low-pass filter;nonlinear cascaded mixed-signal system;single-block module;static nonlinear transfer characteristics","","0","","23","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Liquid cooling based on micro-fluidic channels is proposed as a viable solution to dramatically reduce the operating temperature of 3D ICs. In addition, designers use a highly complex hierarchical power distribution network in conjunction with decoupling capacitors to deliver currents to all parts of the 3D IC while suppressing the power supply noise to an acceptable level. These so called silicon ancillary technologies, however, pose major challenges to routing completion and congestion. These thermal and power/ground interconnects together with those used for signal delivery compete with one another for routing resources including various types of through-silicon-vias (TSVs). This paper presents the work on routing with these interconnects in 3D: signal, power, and thermal networks.

Several techniques for gate and latch hardening have been proposed to synthesize circuits that are tolerant to soft errors. However, each such technique has associated overheads of power, area, and performance. In this paper, we present a new methodology to compute the failures in time (FIT) rate of a sequential circuit where the failures are at the system-level. System-level failures are detected by monitors derived from functional specifications. Our approach includes efficient methods to compute the FIT rate of combinational circuits (CFIT), incorporating effects of logical, timing, and electrical masking. The contribution of circuit components to the FIT rate of the overall circuit can be computed from the CFIT and probabilities of system-level failure due to soft errors in those elements. Designers can use this information to perform Pareto-optimal hardening of selected sequential and combinational components against soft errors. We present experimental results demonstrating that our analysis is efficient, accurate, and provides data that can be used to synthesize a low-overhead, low-FIT sequential circuit.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090770","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Combinational circuits;Computer errors;Digital circuits;Error analysis;Latches;Logic;Sequential circuits;Timing","combinational circuits;hardening;logic design;sequential circuits","Pareto-optimal hardening;combinational circuits;digital circuits;failures in time rate;gate hardening;latch hardening;low-FIT sequential circuit;system-level failures;system-level soft error analysis","","3","","23","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fail-safe systems based on a novel CPLD-based architecture require a different method to perform fault insertion testing than microcontroller-based systems. This paper describes a method to accomplish fault insertion testing of a system based on the novel CPLD-based architecture using the original system hardware. The goal is to verify the realized safety integrity measures of the system by inserting faults and observing the behavior of the system. The described method exploits the fact, that the system contains two channels, where both channels contain a CPLD. During a test one CPLD is configured using a modified programming file. This file is available after the compilation of a VHDL-description, which was modified using saboteurs or mutants. This allows injecting a fault into this CPLD. The other CPLD is configured as fault-free device. The entire system has to detect the injected fault using its safety integrity measures. Consequently it has to enter and/or maintain a safe state.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090660","CPLD;IEC 61508;VHDL;fail-safe system;fault injection;fault insertion testing;safety integrity","Automation;Fault detection;Hardware;IEC standards;Informatics;Microcontrollers;Performance evaluation;Safety devices;Switches;System testing","hardware description languages;microcontrollers;programmable logic devices","CPLD;VHDL description;complex programmable logic device;fail-safe system;fault insertion testing;microcontrollers;programming file;safety integrity;standard IEC 61508","","1","","10","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new fast gate sizing algorithm that works natively with discrete cell choices and realistic timing models. The approach iteratively assigns signal slew targets to all source pins of the chip and chooses discrete layouts of minimum size preserving the slew targets. Using slew targets instead of delay budgets, accurate estimates for the input slews are available during the sizing step. Slew targets are updated by an estimate of the local slew gradient. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we propose a new heuristic to estimate lower bounds for the worst path delay. On average, we violate these bounds by 6%. A subsequent local search decreases this gap quickly to 2%. This two-stage approach is capable of sizing designs with more than 5.8 million cells within 2.5 hours and thus helping to decrease turn-around times of multi-million cell designs.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090777","","Application specific integrated circuits;Capacitance;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Iterative algorithms;Libraries;Mathematics;Pins;Solid modeling;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;delay systems;iterative methods;timing","delay budgets;discrete cell choices;discrete cell libraries;gate sizing algorithm;multimillion cell designs;sizing step;slew targets;timing models;turn-around times;two-stage approach;worst path delay","","5","","17","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, mapping a task to any available PR region (PRR) requires a unique partial bitstream for each PRR. This replication can introduce significant overheads in terms of bitstream storage and communication requirements. Previous research in partial bitstream relocation can alleviate these overheads by transforming a single partial bitstream to map to any available PRR. However, careful steps are necessary to ensure proper functionality of relocated partial bitstreams and may result in clock routing inefficiencies. These routing inefficiencies can be alleviated by using regional clock resources introduced in the Virtex-4 FPGAs to implement local clock domains. PRRs can internally drive local clock domains, enabling each PRR to vary its clock frequency with respect to a single global clock signal, as opposed to sending multiple global clock signals (one for each desired clock frequency) to each PRR. We introduce this novel local clock domain (LCD) concept, which provides enhanced PR design flexibility. However, integration of LCDs and partial bitstream relocation introduces new challenges. In this paper, we identify motivating application domains for this integration, analyze integration benefits, and provide a detailed integration methodology.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090676","local clock domains (LCDs);partial reconfiguration;relocatable","Application software;Clocks;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Hardware;Routing;Runtime;Signal design;System-on-a-chip","clocks;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA;Virtex-4;bitstream relocation;clock routing inefficiencies;local clock domains","","5","","14","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also propose novel techniques to validate our statistical assumptions and to identify any outliers in the measurements. Using the proposed model, we analyze the impact of the systematic and random sources of process variations to reveal their spatial structures.

In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a variability-aware design framework for fully-synchronous (FS) and multiple clock-domain (MCD) 3D systems. First, we develop analytical system-level models of the impact of process variations on the performance of FS 3D designs. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparing against transistor-level Monte Carlo simulations in SPICE - we observe a maximum error of only 0:7% (average 0:31% error) in the mean of the maximum critical path delay distribution. Second, to mitigate the impact of process variations on 3D designs, we propose a variability-aware 3D integration strategy for MCD 3D systems that maximizes the probability of the design meeting specified system performance constraints. The proposed optimization strategy is shown to significantly outperform FS and MCD 3D implementations that are conventionally assembled - for example, the MCD designs assembled with the proposed integration strategy provide, on average, 44% and 16:33% higher absolute yield than the FS and conventional MCD designs respectively, at the 50% yield point of the conventional MCD designs.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090739","","Analytical models;Assembly systems;Clocks;Costs;Delay;Design optimization;Integrated circuit technology;Performance analysis;SPICE;System performance","integrated circuit design;optimisation;system-on-chip","3D MPSoC;MCD design;maximum critical path delay distribution;multiple clock-domain system;optimization strategy;probability;system-level process;variability-aware design framework","","5","","22","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the scan test infrastructure allows reaching states not reachable in the application mode, and since faults only detectable in such unreachable states are not relevant in the application mode, we distinguish those irrelevant faults from relevant faults, i.e. faults detectable in the application mode. We prove that every combinatorial circuit with exactly 100% stuck-at fault coverage has 100% transition fault test coverage for those faults which are relevant in the application. This does not necessarily imply that combinatorial circuits with almost 100% single-stuck at coverage automatically have high transition fault coverage.

The resulting timing models have accurate input-output delays and are about 80% smaller than the original circuits. Additionally, an accurate hierarchical timing analysis method at design level using pre-characterized timing models is proposed. This method incorporates the correlation between modules by replacing independent random variables to improve timing accuracy.

Compared with the prior works, our technique considers PLA defects on both input and output planes at the same time. This synergistic approach can help solve logic mapping problems with higher defect rates. The proposed method is universally suitable for various nanoscale PLAs, including AND/OR, NOR/NOR structures, etc. The experimental results have shown that it can efficiently solve large mapping problems at a total defect rate of 20% or even higher.

Models that can run at high simulation speeds are often modeled at abstraction levels that make them unsuitable for use-cases where timing accuracy is required. Similarly, most models that are cycle accurate are inherently too slow (due to clock sensitive processes) to be used in use-cases where high simulation speed is key.

In this paper, we present a novel framework using joint logic restructuring and pin reordering to mitigate NBTI-induced performance degradation. Based on detecting functional symmetries and transistor stacking effects, the proposed methodology involves only wire perturbation and introduces no gate area overhead at all. Experimental results reveal that, by using this approach, on average 56% of performance loss due to NBTI can be recovered.

In this paper, we address these constraints and present a general analysis which allows the calculation of response times for fixed priority task sets with arbitrary activations and deadlines in a partitioned multiprocessor system with shared resources. Furthermore, we derive an improved bound on the blocking time in this setup for the case where the shared resources are protected according to the Multiprocessor Priority Ceiling Protocol (MPCP).","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090720","","Computer networks;Delay;Multiprocessing systems;Partitioning algorithms;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Testing;Timing","multiprocessing systems;protocols;task analysis","arbitrarily activated tasks;multiprocessor priority ceiling protocol;multiprocessor systems;real time environments;response time analysis;schedulability tests;shared resources;sporadic task activation pattern","","3","","20","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If this is not taken into consideration during the task allocation and scheduling process, some processors might age much faster than the others and become the reliability bottleneck for the system, thus significantly reducing the system's service life. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an analytical model to estimate the lifetime reliability of multiprocessor platforms when executing periodical tasks, and we present a novel lifetime reliability-aware task allocation and scheduling algorithm based on simulated annealing technique. In addition, to speed up the annealing process, several techniques are proposed to simplify the design space exploration process with satisfactory solution quality.

But analysis of system-level trade-offs has been inhibited by the diversity of models and the dynamic nature of modern dataflow applications. To facilitate design space exploration for software implementations of heterogeneous dataflow applications, developers need tools capable of deeply analyzing and optimizing the application. To this end, we present a new scheduling approach that leverages a recently proposed general model of dynamic dataflow called core functional dataflow (CFDF). CFDF supports high-level application descriptions with multiple models of dataflow by structuring actors with sets of modes that represent fixed behaviors. In this work we show that by decomposing a dynamic dataflow graph as directed by its modes, we can derive a set of static dataflow graphs that interact dynamically. This enables designers to readily experiment with existing dataflow model specific scheduling techniques to all or some parts of the application while applying custom schedulers to others. We demonstrate this generalized dataflow scheduling method on dynamic mixed-model applications and show that run-time and buffer sizes significantly improve compared to a baseline dynamic dataflow scheduler and simulator.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090642","","Application software;Design optimization;Digital signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Kernel;Runtime;Signal design;Software architecture;Software tools;Space exploration","digital signal processing chips;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;parallel processing;scheduling","core functional dataflow;digital signal processing;dynamic dataflow applications;dynamic mixed model;generalized scheduling;heterogeneous dataflow application;software implementation;space exploration;static dataflow graph","","6","","19","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All the strategies proposed up to now to simplify this operation require a manual, even formal, specification of the device driver functionalities. In the system-level design, IP functionalities are tested by using testbenches, implemented to contain the communication protocols to correctly interact with the device. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to automatically generate device drivers from the testbench of any RTL IP. The only manual step required is to tag the states corresponding to the different device functionalities. The Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs) are then used to create a correct-by-construction two-level device driver: the lower level deals with architectural choices, while the higher one is derived from the EFSMs and it implements the communication protocols. The effectiveness of this methodology has been proved by applying it to a platform provided by STMicroelectronics.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090900","","Access protocols;Automata;Automatic testing;Design engineering;Embedded system;Error correction;Manuals;Object oriented modeling;System testing;System-level design","driver circuits;embedded systems","IP functionalities;RTL testbenches;correct-by-construction generation;device drivers;error prone activity;extended finite state machines;system-level design","","5","","","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these techniques are not effective in the presence of certain design structural constraints that limit the CSS. In this paper, we present an analysis of several design structural constraints that affect the CSS and propose techniques to resolve these constraints. Furthermore, we propose a CSS FPGA architecture and a novel clock-period optimization (CPO) flow that tackles some of these constraints by exploiting the re-configurability of FPGAs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FPGA architecture with the CPO flow achieved an average performance improvement of 24.4% which was an average performance improvement of 10.7% over the CPO flow without considering the constraints.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090904","","Cascading style sheets;Clocks;Constraint optimization;Delay;Design optimization;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Pipelines;Scheduling;Timing","clocks;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA;clock period;clock skew scheduling;sequential designs","","1","","10","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Native C++ data types for instance will not appear in meta-data extracted by introspection facilities.

However, future gigascale systems cannot rely solely on existing chemical synthesis for guaranteed ideal devices. VLSI-scale logic circuits using CNFETs must overcome major challenges posed by: 1) Misaligned and mis-positioned Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs); 2) Metallic CNTs; and, 3) CNT density variations. This paper performs detailed analysis of the impact of these challenges on CNFET circuit performance. A combination of design and processing techniques, presented this paper, can enable VLSI-scale CNFET logic circuits that are immune to high rates of inherent imperfections. These techniques are inexpensive compared to traditional defect- and fault-tolerance, do not impose major changes in VLSI design flows, and are compatible with VLSI processing because they do not require special customization on chip-by-chip basis.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090705","","CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;Chemicals;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Immunity testing;Logic circuits;Performance analysis;Process design;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;carbon nanotubes;logic circuits","CNFET processing;VLSI-scale logic circuits;carbon nanotube field effect transistors;carbon nanotubes;chemical synthesis;gigascale systems;imperfection-immune VLSI logic circuits;metallic CNT;silicon-CMOS","","4","","25","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a hardware compression engine for cache data using a Cache Aware Compression strategy that exploits knowledge of the cache fields and their behavior to achieve an effective compression. Experimental results indicate that the technique results in 7-31% better compression than one that treats the data as just one long bit stream.

In this paper we propose the first approach for automatic debugging of reversible Toffoli networks. Our method uses a formulation for the debugging problem based on Boolean satisfiability. We show the differences to classical (irreversible) debugging and present theoretical results. These are used to speed-up the debugging approach as well as to improve the resulting quality. Our method is able to find and to correct single errors automatically.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090863","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computer science;Debugging;Error correction;Logic circuits;Logic testing;Quantum computing;Transistors","formal verification;logic CAD;logic circuits;logic testing;network synthesis","Boolean satisfiability;Toffoli network debugging;automatic debugging;logic testing;logic verification;quantum computer;reversible circuits;reversible logic synthesis","","4","","29","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed technique uses machine learning techniques instead of traditional cause-effect and/or effect-cause analysis. The proposed technique has several advantages over traditional diagnosis methods, especially for volume diagnosis. In the proposed method, since the time consuming diagnosis process is reduced to merely evaluating several decision functions, run time complexity is much lower than traditional diagnosis methods. The proposed technique can provide not only high resolution diagnosis but also statistical data by classifying defective chips according to locations of their defects. Even with highly compressed output responses, the proposed diagnosis technique can correctly locate defect locations for most defective chips. The proposed technique correctly located defects for more than 90% (86%) defective chips at 50times (100times) output compaction. Run time for diagnosing a single simulated defect chip was only tens of milli-seconds.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090792","","Built-in self-test;Cause effect analysis;Circuit faults;Compaction;Fault diagnosis;Machine learning;National electric code;Polynomials;Random access memory;System testing","electronic engineering computing;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;learning (artificial intelligence);semiconductor industry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;system-on-chip","SoC;defect localization;defective chip classification;highly compressed output response;machine learning-based volume diagnosis;run time complexity;semiconductor companies;single simulated defect chip diagnosis;statistical data;support vector machine","","6","1","16","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The self-reconfiguring platform is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA and uses the FPGA's PowerPC as configuration manager. This configuration manager generates optimized configurations on-the-fly and writes them to the configuration memory using the ICAP.

Furthermore, these structures are subject to parametric effects due to small variations of the geometric and physical properties of the inherent materials and manufacturing process. Accuracy requirements lead to huge models, which are expensive to simulate and this cost is increased when parameters and their effects are taken into account. This paper presents a complete procedure for efficient reduction of realistic, hierarchy aware, EM based parametric models. Knowledge of the structure of the problem is explicitly exploited using domain partitioning and novel electromagnetic connector modeling techniques to generate a hierarchical representation. This enables the efficient use of block parametric model order reduction techniques to generate block-wise compressed models that satisfy overall requirements, and provide accurate approximations of the complete EM behaviour, which are cheap to evaluate and simulate.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090840","","Connectors;Electromagnetic coupling;Electromagnetic modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Maxwell equations;Parametric statistics;Predictive models;Process design;Radio frequency","electric connectors;electromagnetic coupling;interconnections","EM based parametric models;block-wise compressed model;electromagnetic connector modeling techniques;electromagnetic field coupling;electromagnetic models;manufacturing process","","2","","15","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, measuring the oscillator frequencies (e.g., for maintenance or diagnosis) is usually difficult to perform since it requires physical access to each single node and may interfere with the running application. Moreover, clock synchronization features tend to mask clock deviations. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive method for remote measurement of the individual oscillator drifts within a distributed system. Our approach is based on a tester that sends carefully aligned messages to stimulate the clock synchronization service and records the resulting bus traffic for an analysis of the nodes' synchronization behavior.

Timing/performance is becoming a key aspect of architecture design, because the platform must be dimensioned to provide just the right amount of computing power and network bandwidth, including reserves for future extensions, in order to be cost efficient. In other words, it must be as powerful as needed but as cheap as possible. Finding this sweet spot is a key challenge. Therefore, OEMs and Tier-1 are in search of new methods, processes, and timing analysis techniques that assist in early platform design stages. In this paper, we demonstrate how some selected techniques that are established for verification (in late design stages) can also be used to guide the design (in early stages). We present examples in the areas ECU (OSEK), buses (CAN, FlexRay) and gated networks. Flow and applicability aspects are highlighted.

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","81","86","As semiconductor manufacturing enters advanced nanometer design paradigm, aging and device wear-out related degradation is becoming a major concern. Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is one of the main sources of device lifetime degradation. The severity of such degradation depends on the operation history of a chip in the field, including such characteristics as temperature and workloads. In this paper, we propose a system level reliability management scheme where a chip dynamically adjusts its own operating frequency and supply voltage over time as the device ages. Major benefits of the proposed approach are (i) increased performance due to reduced frequency guard banding in the factory and (ii) continuous field adjustments that take environmental operating conditions such as actual room temperature and the power supply tolerance into account. The greatest challenge in implementing such a scheme is to perform calibration without a tester. Much of this work is performed by a hypervisor like software with very little hardware assistance. This keeps both the hardware overhead and the system complexity low. This paper describes the entire system architecture including hardware and software components. Our simulation data indicates that under aggressive wear-out conditions, scheduling interval of days or weeks is sufficient to reconfigure and keep the system operational, thus the run time overhead for such adjustments is of no consequence at all.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090637","","Aging;Degradation;Frequency;Hardware;Nanoscale devices;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Semiconductor device manufacture;Titanium compounds;Transistors","MOSFET;calibration;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor device testing;software architecture;virtual machines","aggressive wear-out conditions;calibration;co-designed virtual machine;device lifetime degradation;hardware components;negative bias temperature instability;operating frequency;self-adaptive system architecture;semiconductor manufacturing;software components;system level reliability management scheme;transistor aging;voltage supply","","14","","29","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the best characteristics that each technology has to offer through the use of read-write aware hybrid cache architecture (RWHCA) designs, where a single level of cache can be partitioned into read and write regions, each of a different memory technology with disparate read and write characteristics. We explore the potential of hardware support for intra-cache data movement within RWHCA caches. Utilizing a full-system simulator that has been validated against real hardware, we demonstrate that a RWHCA design with a conservative setup can provide a geometric mean 55% power reduction and yet 5% IPC improvement over a baseline SRAM cache design across a collection of 30 workloads. Furthermore, a 2-layer 3D cache stack (3DRWHCA) of high density memory technology with the same chip footprint still gives 10% power reduction and boost performance by 16% IPC improvement over the baseline.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090762","","Nonvolatile memory","MRAM devices;SRAM chips;cache storage;computer architecture;logic design","SRAM cache design;cell density;dynamic power consumption;full-system simulator;high density memory technology;magnetic RAM;nonvolatile memory technologies;phase-change RAM;read-write aware hybrid cache architecture;static power consumption","","14","1","14","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IVC technique is in-effective for larger circuits. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two fast gate replacement algorithms together with optimal input vector selection to simultaneously mitigate leakage power and NBTI induced circuit degradation: Direct Gate Replacement (DGR) algorithm and Divide and Conquer Based Gate Replacement (DCBGR) algorithm. Our experimental results on 20 benchmark circuits at 65 nm technology node reveal that: 1) Both DGR and DCBGR algorithms outperform pure IVC about on average 20% for three different object functions: leakage power reduction only, NBTI mitigation only, and leakage/NBTI co-optimization. 2) The DCBGR algorithm leads to better optimization results and save on average 100X runtime compared with the DGR algorithm.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090683","","Aging","MOS integrated circuits;ageing;integrated circuit reliability;leakage currents;logic design;logic gates","aging optimization;circuit degradation;direct gate replacement algorithm;divide-and-conquer gate replacement;gate replacement technique;input vector control;leakage optimization;negative bias temperature instability;size 65 nm","","7","","18","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HLS-l is a new design framework that employs high-performance latches during scheduling, allocation, and controller synthesis. Its main feature is a new scheduler that is based on a concept of phase step (as opposed to conventional control step), which allows us scheduling in finer granularity, register allocation that resolves the conflict of latch being read and written at the same time, and controller synthesis that exploits dual-edge triggered storage elements to support phase step based scheduling.

Similarly, they are not suitable for many-core architectures (processors with tens or possibly hundreds of cores on the same die) due to an exponential explosion in the number of global power management states. In this paper, we look at a hierarchical and a gradient ascent-based technique for decentralized peak power management for many-core architectures. The proposed techniques prevent power from exceeding the peak power budget and enable the placement of several more cores on a die than what the power budget would normally allow. We show up to 47% (33% on average) improvements in throughput for a given power budget.

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","658","663","Ensuring correctness of execution of complex multi-core processor systems deployed in the field remains to this day an extremely challenging task. The major part of this effort is concentrated on design verification, where different pre- and post-silicon techniques are used to guarantee that devices behave exactly as stated in the specification. Unfortunately, the performance of even state-of-the-art validation tools lags behind the growing complexity of multi-core designs. Therefore, subtle bugs still slip into released components, causing incorrect computational results, or even compromising the security of the end-user systems. In this work we present Caspar - an approach for in-the-field patching of the memory subsystem hardware in multi-core chips. Caspar relies on a checkpointing system, which periodically logs the state of the chip, and a novel error detection and recovery scheme, which uses a simplified mode of operation to bypass cache coherence and consistency errors. The implementation of Caspar employs hardware detectors: on-die programmable circuits to identify system's configurations that may lead to bugs, and to trigger recovery and bypass. Our experimental results show that Caspar can be used effectively to detect and bypass a variety of memory subsystem bugs, with as little as 2% performance impact and 6% area overhead during bug-free operation.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090748","","Checkpointing;Coherence;Computer bugs;Detectors;Hardware;Multicore processing;Programmable circuits;Protocols;Runtime;Security","hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","Caspar;bug-free operation;checkpointing system;design verification;end-user systems;hardware patching;in-the-field patching;memory subsystem hardware;multicore processors","","0","","16","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goodness of fit of the MDE paradigm for the industrial domain of interest was critically assessed on a small number of candidate solutions. One of the main axes of investigation concerned HRT-UML/RCM, an advanced method and integrated tool for the model-driven development of embedded real-time software systems. HRT-UML/RCM vastly leveraged on version 2 of the OMG UML standard and combined it with the development of a domain-specific metamodel in the quest to attain correctness-by-construction from the ground up. The prototype tool developed in the project supported: (1) the separation of functional (sequential) design from the specification of real-time and concurrency requirements and properties to be preserved at run time; and (2) the exploitation of a fully generative approach to the development, equipped with support for model-based feasibility analysis and round-trip engineering.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090837","","Analytical models;Application software;Job shop scheduling;Logic;Model driven engineering;Paper technology;Prototypes;Real time systems;Software systems;Unified modeling language","computer architecture;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;real-time systems;sequential circuits","embedded real-time software systems;functional design;high-integrity systems;model-based feasibility analysis;model-driven engineering methodology;round-trip engineering;sequential design","","2","","23","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem has been proven to be NP-complete. A static scheduling algorithm is usually described as a monolithic process, and carries out two distinct functionalities: choosing the core to execute a specific function and evaluating the cost of the generated solutions. This paper describes a scheduling module which splits these functionalities into two sub-modules. This division produces an advanced scalability in terms of schedule quality and computation time, and also separates the heuristic complexity from the architecture model precision.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090909","","Computer architecture;Costs;Delay;Instruments;Processor scheduling;Prototypes;Scalability;Scheduling algorithm;Signal processing algorithms;Timing","computational complexity;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling","NP-complete problem;advanced scalability;automatic scheduling;heuristic complexity;model-based designs;monolithic process;multicore architectures;scalable compile-time scheduler;static scheduling algorithm","","0","","12","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Where there have been some successes in the areas of system analysis and virtual prototyping by SoC architects and software developers, investment costs for modelling can be costly or scarce. Also, there is yet to be a standard for applying IP power modelling that fits with a TLM terminology and into the overall system modelling process. Although power is hardly analyzed today even at the RTL level, “access” to power at the ESL domain may become much more critical, given the impact designers can have on power behaviour at this level. Ideally, software developers can also gain visibility into power dynamics and adjust their development flow to accommodate power guidelines, as well. With the current isolated HW and SW flows, this may seem unrealistic. What are some of the pitfalls of being “too early” in applying new technologies? This panel will explore critical issues and possible solutions for designing power applications, enabling engineering teams to rethink their approach to design planning using available ESL tools and methods.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090760","","","","","","0","","","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low-radix networks, such as 2D-MESH, are widely used in tiled CMPs since they can be mapped to on-chip networks efficiently. However, low-radix networks introduce high network latency caused by long diameter. In this paper, we propose the use of group-caching design in NoC based multicore cache coherent systems. In our design, on-chip L2 banks are organized to form multiple groups. Each cache group behaves like a shared L2 cache for the cores inside cache group while the cache coherence between cache groups is maintained by coherence messages. Besides, group-caching also adopts the new cache replacement policy to improve the inefficient use of the aggregate L2 cache capacity. Compared to banked and shared L2 design, as most L2 accesses are served by local cache group, the hop count is significantly reduced. Experiment results based on full-system simulation show that for 2D-MESH, group-caching can increase the performance by 2%~8% compared to banked and shared L2 design, with network energy consumption reduced by 11%~13%. Experiment results also show that the communication overhead inside cache group plays an important role in the performance of group caching.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090765","CMP;L2 banks;NOC;cache coherence;group-caching;network latency;performance;power","Aggregates;Computer networks;Delay;Multicore processing;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;System-on-a-chip;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wires","cache storage;network-on-chip","2D-MESH;NoC;cache coherence;group-caching;multicore cache coherent systems","","0","","22","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such systems it is not only necessary to guarantee timing constraints in every operating mode, but also during the transition between different modes. Known approaches that address the problem of timing analysis over mode changes are restricted to fixed priority scheduling policies. In addition, most of them are also limited to simple periodic event stream models and therefore, they can not faithfully abstract the bursty timing behavior which can be observed in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a new method for the design and analysis of adaptive multi-mode systems that supports any event stream model and can handle earliest deadline first (EDF) as well as fixed priority (FP) scheduling of tasks.

Most methods for estimating propagation delay identify multi-cycle paths (MCPs), which allow timing to be relaxed, but ignore the set of reachable states, achieving scalability at the cost of a severe lack of precision. Even simple circuits contain paths affecting timing that can only be detected if the set of reachable states is considered. We examine the theoretical foundations of MCP identification and characterise the MCPs in a circuit by a fixed point equation. The optimal solution to this equation can be computed iteratively and yields the largest set of MCPs in a circuit. Further, we define conservative approximations of this set, show how different MCP identification methods in the literature compare in terms of precision, and show one method to be unsound. The practical application of these results is a new method to detect multi-cycle paths using techniques for computing invariants in a circuit. Our implementation performs well on several benchmarks, including an exponential improvement on circuits analysed in the literature.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090938","","Circuits;Clocks;Costs;Delay estimation;Equations;Frequency;Propagation delay;Scalability;State estimation;Timing","fixed point arithmetic;optimisation;sequential circuits;timing circuits","fixed point equation;multi-cycle path detection;multi-cycle paths;optimal clock frequency;propagation delay;timing analysis","","3","","13","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These buffers are tuned to improve maximum operating clock frequency of a design. Previously, we have presented an algorithmic approach that uses delay measurements on a few selected patterns to determine which buffers should be targeted for tuning. In this paper, a study on impact of tunable buffer placement on performance is reported. Greatest benefit from tunable buffer placement is observed, when the clock tree is designed by the proposed tuning system assuming random delay perturbations during design.

Networks-on-chip (NoCs) can improve the on-chip communication bandwidth of MPSoCs. However, traditional metallic interconnects consume significant amount of power to deliver even higher communication bandwidth required in the near future. Optical NoCs are based on CMOS-compatible optical waveguides and microresonators, and promise significant bandwidth and power advantages. This paper proposes a fat tree-based optical NoC (FONoC) including its topology, floorplan, protocols, and a low-power and low-cost optical router, optical turnaround router (OTAR). Different from other optical NoCs, FONoC does not require building a separate electronic NoC for network control. It carries both payload data and network control data on the same optical network, while using circuit switching for the former and packet switching for the latter. The FONoC protocols are designed to minimize network control data and the related power consumption. An optimized turnaround routing algorithm is designed to utilize the low-power feature of OTAR, which can passively route packets without powering on any microresonator in 40% of all cases. Comparing with other optical routers, OTAR has the lowest optical power loss and uses the lowest number of microresonators. An analytical model is developed to characterize the power consumption of FONoC. We compare the power consumption of FONoC with a matched electronic NoC in 45 nm, and show that FONoC can save 87% power comparing with the electronic NoC on a 64-core MPSoC. We simulate the FONoC for the 64-core MPSoC and show the end-to-end delay and network throughput under different offered loads and packet sizes.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090624","","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Microcavities;Multiprocessing systems;Network-on-a-chip;Optical fiber networks;Optical interconnections;Optical packet switching;Optical waveguides;Protocols","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated optoelectronics;low-power electronics;metallisation;network routing;network-on-chip;optical waveguides;trees (mathematics)","CMOS-compatible optical waveguides;circuit switching;end-to-end delay;low-cost optical router;low-power fat tree-based optical network-on-chip;metallic interconnects;microresonator;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network control data;network throughput;on-chip communication bandwidth;optimized turnaround routing algorithm;packet switching;power consumption;power loss;size 45 nm","","28","","30","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, the choice of supply voltage in SRAMs is governed by bit cell read static noise margin, writability, data retention etc. However, in the nanometer technology nodes, the choice of supply voltage impacts the reliability of SRAMs as well. Two important reliability challenges for current and future generation SRAMs are gate oxide degradation and soft error susceptibility. The current generation transistors have ultra-thin gate oxides to improve the device performance and they are prone to breakdown due to higher level of electric field stress. In addition, the soft error susceptibility of SRAMs has significantly increased in the nanometer regime. In this work, we have quantified the impact of voltage scaling on the soft error susceptibility of gate oxide degraded SRAMs.We show that when gate oxide degradation is taken into account, there exists an optimal voltage (V<sub>opt</sub>) at which the bit cell Qcrit is maximized. Further, we show that both V<sub>opt</sub> and Qcrit<sub>max</sub> are a function of the level of oxide degradation. Finally, we investigate the impact of technology node scaling and analyze the trend of V<sub>opt</sub> and Qcrit<sub>max</sub>.

We address the issue of scheduling robustness, i.e. providing hard guarantees that the schedule will meet the end-to-end deadline in presence of bounded variations of task execution times expressed as min-max intervals known at design time. We present a robust scheduling algorithm that proactively inserts sequencing constraints when they are needed to ensure that execution will have no inserted idle times and will meet the deadline for any possible combination of task execution times within the specified intervals. The algorithm is complete, i.e. it will return a feasible graph augmentation if one exists.

There are variety of hardware aging techniques that range from electro-migration in wires to slow-down of crystal-based clocks. We focus on transistor aging due to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) effects where the delay of gates increases proportionally to usage times. We address the problem of how we can measure the amount of time a particular licensed software (LS) is used by designing an aging circuitry and exposing it to the unique inputs associated with each LS. If a particular LS is used longer than specified, it automatically disables itself. Our novel HSCM technique uses a multi-stage optimization problem of computing the delays of gates, their aging degradation factors, and finally LS usage using convex programming. The experimental results show not just viability of the technique but also surprisingly high accuracy in the presence of measurement noise and imperfect aging models.

It offers high throughput and excellent scalability for on-chip data and protocol transactions. The main problem posed by this communication fabric is the potentially-high and nondeterministic network latency caused by router data buffering and resource arbitration. This paper describes a new method to minimize on-chip network latency, which is motivated by the observation that only a small percentage of on-chip data and protocol traffic is latency-critical. Existing work focusing on minimizing average network latency is thus suboptimal. Such techniques expend most of the design, area, and power overhead accelerating latency-noncritical traffic for which there is no corresponding application-level speedup. We propose run-time techniques that identify latency-critical traffic by leveraging network data-transaction and protocol information. Latency-critical traffic is permitted to bypass router pipeline stages and latency-noncritical traffic. These techniques are evaluated via a router design that has been implemented using TSMC 65nm technology. Detailed network latency simulation and hardware characterization demonstrate that, for latency-critical traffic, the proposed solution closely approximates the ideal interconnect even under heavy load while preserving throughput for both latency-critical and noncritical traffic.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090820","","Acceleration;Computer buffers;Delay;Fabrics;Network-on-a-chip;Protocols;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","critical path analysis;multiprotocol label switching;packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","TSMC technology;bypass router pipeline stages;hardware characterization;latency criticality aware;many-core architectures;nondeterministic network latency;on-chip communication;packet-switched interconnect fabric;potentially-high network latency;protocol traffic;protocol transactions;resource arbitration;router data buffering;run-time techniques;size 65 nm","","3","","18","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, 3D integration introduces serious thermal challenges due to the high power density resulting from placing computational units on top of each other. In this work, we first investigate how the existing thermal management, power management and job scheduling policies affect the thermal behavior in 3D chips.

Recently, Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCAs) have been proposed to sustain the size growth trend of secondary caches that is threatened by wire-delay problems. NUCAs are size-oriented, and they were not conceived to close the inter-cache latency gap. To tackle this problem, we propose Light NUCAs (L-NUCAs) leveraging on-chip wire density to interconnect small tiles through specialized networks, which convey packets with distributed and dynamic routing. Our design reduces the tile delay (cache access plus one-hop routing) to a single processor cycle and places cache lines at a finer granularity than conventional caches, reducing cache latency. Our evaluations show that in general, an L-NUCA improves simultaneously performance, energy, and area when integrated into both conventional or D-NUCA hierarchies.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090721","","Delay;Proposals","","","","1","","","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Advantages over current state of the art reliability simulators include, among others, the possibility to estimate the impact of variability and the ability to account for the effects of complex time-varying stress signals. Results show that taking time-varying stress signals into account provides circuit reliability information not visible with classic DC-only reliability simulators.

This paper presents a static analysis approach for Register File (RF) vulnerability estimation. We decompose the vulnerability of a register into intrinsic and conditional basic-block vulnerabilities. This decomposition allows us to develop a fast, yet reasonably accurate, linear equation-based RF vulnerability estimation mechanism. We demonstrate its practical application to compiler optimizations. Our experimental results on benchmarks from MiBench suite indicate that not only our static RF vulnerability estimation is fast and accurate, but also compiler optimizations enabled by our static estimation can achieve very cost-effective protection of register files against soft errors.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090877","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090877","","Computer errors;Error correction codes;Hardware;Microarchitecture;Optimizing compilers;Protection;Radio frequency;Registers;Runtime;Space technology","error analysis;error correction codes;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;optimising compilers","block post-condition estimation;compiler optimizations;linear equation;linear function representation;memory structures;register file vulnerability estimation;soft errors;static estimation","","4","","25","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical SoC decomposes a system into components which are individually specified. These components are in a pre-existing form that satisfies the specification or are custom-made. With the needed flexibility the decision for components to be hardwired, programmable, or software-based need to be pushed to the end of the design phase. The most desirable situation is that the composition of these components results in the expected system behaviour. The rule, however, is that significant system integration effort is required to make the composition of components operate as intended. To a large extent, this is because of cross-cutting concerns that result from parafunctional characteristics often associated with the integration platform. Ideally, components should be composable (i.e., their properties should not change when connected to other components) and the system should be compositional (i.e., emergent system properties should be derivable from the component properties).

NoCs with configurable routing, whereby the communication routes are explicitly chosen at runtime out of a set of statically predefined alternatives, provide intelligent adaptation without impacting the consistency of traffic flows. However, configurable source routing on a NoC platform requires a design that provides fast path lookup coupled with low area and power consumption. This paper presents an exploration and synthesis approach that, depending on the required amount of routing flexibility, can for example reduce by 3 to 15 times the area cost of the NoC routing tables by adopting partially reprogrammable routing logic instead of fully reprogrammable tables. Further optimizations based on path redundancy allow to reduce up to 17 times the silicon cost.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090668","","Costs;Energy consumption;Network interfaces;Network synthesis;Network-on-a-chip;Quality of service;Routing;Runtime;System recovery;Telecommunication traffic","multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip;quality of service;telecommunication links;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","deadlock freedom;link failures;low-overhead configurable source;message ordering;network interfaces;networks-on-chip;on-chip multiprocessor communication;quality of service;reprogrammable routing logic;routing flexibility;routing tables;traffic flows","","5","","24","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","670","675","Caches often employ write-back instead of write-through, since write-back avoids unnecessary transfers for multiple writes to the same block. For several reasons, however, it is undesirable that a significant number of cache lines will be marked ldquodirtyrdquo. Energy-efficient cache organizations, for example, often apply techniques that resize, reconfigure, or turn off (parts of) the cache. In such cache organizations, dirty lines have to be written back before the cache is reconfigured. The delay imposed by these write-backs or the required additional logic and buffers can significantly reduce the attained energy savings. A cache organization called the clean/dirty cache (CD-cache) is proposed that combines the properties of write-back and write-through. It avoids unnecessary transfers for recurring writes, while restricting the number of dirty lines to a hard limit. Detailed experimental results show that the CD-cache reduces the number of dirty lines significantly, while achieving similar or better performance. We also use the CD-cache to implement cache decay. Experimental results show that the CD-cache attains similar or higher performance than a normal decay cache, while using a significantly less complex design.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090750","","Added delay;Computer science;Delay lines;Energy efficiency;Error correction;Laboratories;Mathematics;Power dissipation;Reconfigurable logic;Writing","buffer circuits;cache storage;write-once storage","additional logic;buffers;cache decay;clean/dirty cache;dirty cache lines;energy-efficient cache organizations;write-backs","","0","","10","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Efficient constant-time entropy decoding for H.264","Iqbal, N.; Henkel, J.","Dept. of Embedded Syst., Univ. of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition, 2009. DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","1440","1445","Diverse approaches to parallel implementation of H.264 have been proposed; however, they all share a common problem. The entropy decoder in H.264 remains mapped on a single processing element (PE). Due to the inherently sequential and context-adaptive nature of the entropy decoder, it cannot be parallelized. This renders a bottleneck to the performance of the entire decoding process. Depending on the type of the processing core and the video bit-rate, the performance of the entire decoding process is subject to the process of entropy decoding. It is, therefore, needful to research and implement new algorithmic solutions to compensate for this bottleneck, and thereby make optimal use of parallel implementation of H.264 decoder on mainstream multi-core systems. This paper presents a new CAVLC decoding method which is de-rived by constructing custom CAVLC decoding tables using dasiatable groupingpsila. Compared to the conventional dasiasequential table look-uppsila method, which requires multiple memory accesses. Our proposed method accesses the custom tables only once for the decoding of any symbol. Moreover, in our proposed method, the symbol decoding time does not depend on the symbol length and it is constant for each symbol, resulting in a nearly linear increase in computational complexity with increase in video fidelity as compared to an non linear increase in earlier proposed methods. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm features up to 7times higher performance and 83% less memory accesses compared to conventional methods. We compare to three commonly used, state-of-the-art CAVLC algorithms, such as table look-up by sequential search, table look-up by binary search, and ldquoMoon's methodrdquo.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090890","","Computational complexity;Concurrent computing;Decoding;Embedded system;Encoding;Energy consumption;Entropy;Multicore processing;Transistors;Video compression","decoding;entropy codes;sequential circuits;video coding","H.264 decoder;constant-time entropy decoding;mainstream multicore systems;multiple memory accesses;symbol decoding time;video bit-rate;video fidelity","","1","","21","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","773","778","Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) present a unique scenario for software data prefetching with subtle tradeoffs between memory bandwidth and performance. In a shared L2 based CMP, multiple cores compete for the shared on-chip cache space and limited off-chip pin bandwidth. Purely software based prefetching techniques tend to increase this contention, leading to degradation in performance. In some cases, prefetches can become harmful by kicking out useful data from the shared cache whose next usage is earlier than the prefetched data, and the fraction of such harmful prefetches usually increases when we increase the number of cores used for executing a multi-threaded application code. In this paper, we propose two complementary techniques to address the problem of harmful prefetches in the context of shared L2 based CMPs. These techniques, namely, suppressing select data prefetches (if they are found to be harmful) and pinning select data in the L2 cache (if they are found to be frequent victim of harmful prefetches), are evaluated in this paper using two embedded application codes. Our experiments demonstrate that these two techniques are very effective in mitigating the impact of harmful prefetches, and as a result, we extract significant benefits from software prefetching even with large core counts.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090768","","Application software;Bandwidth;Data engineering;Data mining;Degradation;Prefetching;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Software algorithms;Software performance","cache storage;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;storage management","complementary techniques;embedded application codes;multithreaded application code;off-chip pin bandwidth;on-chip cache space;shared cache based chip multiprocessors;software based prefetching techniques;software data prefetching","","1","","30","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DNA self-assembly is also highly error-prone and requires the use of error-resilience techniques in order to unlock its potential. In this paper we propose a technique for error-resilience that is based on information redundancy but, in contrast to previous information redundancy schemes, can achieve much higher resilience to growth errors. By expanding the neighborhood from which redundant information is taken, we can extend the distance that errors are propagated and therefore increase the likelihood of the error being reversed. Given a growth error rate of isin, we show that with a neighborhood of only 2 we can reduce the error rate to isin<sup>3.64</sup> for arbitrary functions (as compared to isin<sup>2.33</sup> previously achieved). Compared with spatial redundancy approaches, our technique allows for higher density nanostructures and has a greatly reduced assembly time.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090791","","Assembly;Computer errors;Computer science;DNA;Error analysis;Nanoscale devices;Nanostructures;Redundancy;Self-assembly;Tiles","DNA;biology computing;bonds (chemical);error analysis;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;redundancy;self-assembly","DNA binding;DNA self-assembly;embedded information redundancy;error-resilience technique;growth error rate;nanoscale self-assembly;nanostructures","","0","","11","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While static MPSoC execution schedules deliver predictable worst-case performance, the absence of dynamic variability unfortunately constrains their usefulness in such an unreliable execution environment. Adaptive static schedules with predictable responses to run-time resource variations have consequently been proposed, yet the extra constraints imposed by adaptivity on task assignment have resulted in schedule length increases. We propose to eradicate the associated performance degradation of such techniques while retaining all the concomitant benefits, by exploiting an inherent degree of freedom in task assignment regarding the logical to physical core mapping. The proposed technique relies on the use of core reordering and rotation through utilizing a graph representation model, which enables a direction translation of inter-core communication paths into order requirements between cores. The algorithmic implementation results confirm that the proposed technique can drastically reduce the schedule length overhead of both pre- and post-reconfiguration schedules.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090634","","Adaptive scheduling;Availability;Computer science;Degradation;Dynamic scheduling;Processor scheduling;Reliability engineering;Runtime;Scheduling algorithm;Timing","graph theory;integrated circuit reliability;system-on-chip","MPSoC static schedules;adaptive static schedules;computing engines;concomitant benefits;core mapping latitude;dynamic variability;graph representation;inter-core communication paths;physical core mapping;post-reconfiguration schedules;pre-reconfiguration schedules;reliability problems;task assignment","","5","","13","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing approaches, our algorithm is path-oriented, in that it takes advantage of the controllability and observability values in the structure of the model to guide the computation of the paths, their encoding widths and the effective adjustment of these widths in subsequent steps. For path selection, a subset of single-bit path-controlling variables is set to constant values. This can restrict the search from those paths deemed less favorable or have been checked in previous steps, thus simplifying the problem.

Using checkpoint and rollback to handle unavoidable emergencies, our method adapts dynamically by learning to trigger avoidance mechanisms when emergency-prone events recur.

To address sub-wavelength printability, a number of resolution enhancement techniques (RET) have been used. While RET techniques allow printing of sub-wavelength features, the feature width itself becomes highly sensitive to process parameters, which in turn detracts from yield due to small perturbations in manufacturing parameters. Yield loss is a function of random variables such as depth-of-focus and exposure dose. In this paper, we present a first order canonical dose/focus model that takes into account both the correlated and independent randomness of the effects of lithographic variation. A novel tile-based yield estimation technique for a given layout, based on a statistical model for process variability is presented.

The heterogeneity has introduced challenges for energy efficiency in hardware and software implementations. This paper studies how to partition real-time tasks on a platform with heterogeneous processing elements (processors) so that the energy consumption can be minimized. The power consumption models considered in this paper are very general by assuming that the energy consumption with higher workload is larger than that with lower workload, which is true for many systems. We propose an approximation scheme to derive near-optimal solutions for different hardware configurations in energy/power consumption. When the number of processors is a constant, the scheme is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to derive a solution with energy consumption very close to the optimal energy consumption in polynomial-time/space complexity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is very effective in energy efficiency with comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithm.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090754","Energy-efficient scheduling;Heterogeneous multiprocessor;Multiprocessor scheduling","Application software;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Multiprocessing systems;Polynomials;Processor scheduling;Real time systems","embedded systems;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;polynomial approximation;processor scheduling","FPTAS;energy consumption;energy-efficient scheduling;fully polynomial time approximation scheme;heterogeneous multiprocessor system;power consumption model;real-time task","","9","","19","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","448","453","Software defined radio (SDR) is a rapidly evolving technology which implements some functional modules of a radio system in software executing on a programmable processor. SDR provides a flexible mechanism to reconfigure the radio, enabling networked devices to easily adapt to user preferences and the operating environment. However, the very mechanisms that provide the ability to reconfigure the radio through software also give rise to serious security concerns such as unauthorized modification of the software, leading to radio malfunction and interference with other users' communications. Both the SDR device and the network need to be protected from such malicious radio reconfiguration. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to protect SDR devices from malicious reconfiguration. The proposed architecture is based on robust separation of the radio operation environment and user application environment through the use of virtualization. A secure radio middleware layer is used to intercept all attempts to reconfigure the radio, and a security policy monitor checks the target configuration against security policies that represent the interests of various parties. Therefore, secure reconfiguration can be ensured in the radio operation environment even if the operating system in the user application environment is compromised. We have prototyped the proposed secure SDR architecture using VMware and the GNU Radio toolkit, and demonstrate that the overheads incurred by the architecture are small and tolerable. Therefore, we believe that the proposed solution could be applied to address SDR security concerns in a wide range of both general-purpose and embedded computing systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090707","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090707","","Application virtualization;Communication system security;Computer architecture;Interference;Middleware;Monitoring;Protection;Robustness;Software radio;Software systems","middleware;reconfigurable architectures;software radio","GNU radio toolkit;VMware;functional modules;programmable processor;radio operation environment;secure SDR architecture;secure radio middleware layer;secure reconfiguration;secure software defined radio;security policy monitor;virtualization","","1","","24","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Forced Requeue is to prematurely lift out low priority packets from the network and requeue them outside using priority queues. The first benefit of this approach, applicable to any NoC offering best effort services, is that packets that have not yet entered the network now compete with packets inside the network and hence tighter bounds on admission times can be given. The second benefit - which is more specific to deflective routing as in the Nostrum NoC - is that packet ldquoreshufflingrdquo dramatically reduces the latency inside the network for bursty traffic due to a lowered risk of collisions at the exit of the network. This paper studies the Forced Requeuing on a mesh with varying burst sizes and traffic scenarios. The experimental results show a 50% reduction in worst-case latency from a system perspective thanks to a reshaped latency distribution whilst keeping the average latency the same.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090823","","Costs;Delay estimation;Network-on-a-chip;Road accidents;Routing;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Time division multiple access;Traffic control","network routing;network-on-chip","NoC;bursty traffic;packet reshuffling;priority based forced requeue;reshaped latency distribution;wormhole routing;worst-case latencies reduction","","2","","10","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We give a mixed integer linear program formulation for an optimal solution to this problem. The optimal placement of internal node control yields an average 26.7% reduction in NBTI-induced delay over a ten year period for the ISCAS85 benchmarks.

However, this solution is becoming prohibitively expensive, allowing 3D stacked DRAM to become an interesting alternative for mobile applications. In this paper, we examine the power/performance benefits for three different 3D stacked DRAM scenarios. Our high-level memory and Through Silicon Via (TSV) models have been calibrated on state-of-the-art industrial processes. We model the integration of a logic die with TSVs on top of both an existing DRAM and a DRAM with redesigned transceivers for 3D. Finally, we take advantage of the interconnect density enabled by 3D technology to analyze an ultra-wide memory interface. Experimental results confirm that TSV-based 3D integration is a promising technology option for future mobile applications, and that its full potential can be unleashed by jointly optimizing memory architecture and interface logic.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090797","","Bandwidth;Computer applications;Energy consumption;Logic;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Silicon;Through-silicon vias;Transceivers","DRAM chips;mobile communication","3D stacked DRAM;high-level memory;on-chip memory;through silicon via","","8","","18","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to many existing quality of service mechanisms, our technique prioritizes best effort over guaranteed bandwidth traffic for optimal latency. Distributed traffic shaping is used to offer bandwidth guarantees over previously reserved connections, which are established dynamically using control messages. Initial simulation results show that our arbitration scheme can provide tight bandwidth guarantees for streaming traffic under network overload conditions. At the same time, the average latency of best effort traffic is improved compared to a simple prioritization of streaming traffic.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090730","","Network-on-a-chip;Quality of service","","","","0","","","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A parallelization may use either functional or data-level splits, or a combination of both. An accompanying high-level simulator provides rapid feedback about the expected performance of a parallelization, based on platform parameters and profiling data of the sequential application on the target processor.

For a given job and a soft (transient) error probability, we define mathematical formulas for AET that includes bus communication overhead for both voting (active replication) and rollback-recovery with checkpointing (RRC). And, for a given multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC), we define integer linear programming (ILP) models that minimize AET including bus communication overhead when: (1) selecting the number of checkpoints when using RRC, (2) finding the number of processors and job-to-processor assignment when using voting, and (3) defining fault-tolerance scheme (voting or RRC) per job and defining its usage for each job.

Our algorithm is based on a mathematical programming formulation of the scheduling and voltage assignment problem and runs in polynomial time. Experiments with randomly generated task graphs show that up to 30% savings in energy can be obtained by using our algorithm over existing techniques.

Recently, there have been many attempts to use it as a programming environment for embedded MultiProcessor Systems-On-Chip (MPSoCs). This is due both to the ease of specifying parallel execution within a sequential code with OpenMP directives, and to the lack of a standard parallel programming method on MPSoCs. However, MPSoC platforms for embedded applications often feature non-uniform, explicitly managed memory hierarchies with no hardware cache coherency as well as heterogeneous cores with heterogeneous run-time systems. In this paper we present an optimized implementation of the compiler and runtime support infrastructure for OpenMP programming for a non-cache-coherent distributed memory MPSoC with explicitly managed scratchpad memories (SPM). The proposed framework features specific extensions to the OpenMP programming model that leverage explicit management of the memory hierarchy.

A small hardware module is used to manage the sequential retrieval of checksums each time the integrity of the data accessed by the processor sub-system needs to be verified.

Traditionally, NoC architectures only deliver scalability on two of the aforementioned three levels, or do not offer GS. In this paper we present the composable and predictable aelite NoC architecture, that offers only GS, based on flit-synchronous Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). In contrast to other TDM-based NoCs, scalability on the physical level is achieved by using mesochronous or asynchronous links. Functional scalability is accomplished by completely isolating applications, and by having a router architecture that does not limit the number of service levels or connections. We demonstrate how aelite delivers the requested service to hundreds of simultaneous connections, and does so with 5 times less area compared to a state-of-the-art NoC.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090666","","Application software;Computer networks;Delay;Interference;Network-on-a-chip;Physics computing;Scalability;Throughput;Time division multiplexing;Virtual colonoscopy","network routing;network-on-chip;real-time systems;time division multiplexing","NoC architecture;asynchronous links;flit-synchronous time division multiplexing;mesochronous links;network on chip;real-time applications;router architecture;state-of-the-art NoC","","19","","20","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High throughput implementation of the detection unit for MIMO systems is a significant challenge especially for higher order modulation schemes. To achieve superior Bit Error Rate (BER) or Frame Error Rate (FER) performance, the detector has to provide soft values to advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes like Turbo Codes. This paper presents a systolic soft detector architecture for high dimensional (eg. 4times4, 64-QAM) MIMO systems. A Single detector core achieves, throughput of 215 Mbps and power consumption of 23.6 mW, whiles using only 33.1 K gate equivalent (for l<sup>2</sup> norm). Impressive SNR gains of almost 2 dB are observed with respect to the hard detection counterpart over a block fading channel (at an FER of 1%).

Parallel memory accesses with originally in-order requirements necessitate reorder buffers to avoid deadlock. Reorder buffers are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. In addition, conventional reorder buffers suffer from a problem of low resource utilization. In our work, we present a novel idea, called in-network reorder buffer, to increase the utilization of reorder buffer resource. In our method, we move the reorder buffer resource and related functions from network entry/exit points to network routers. Thus, the in-network reorder buffers can be better utilized in two ways. First, they can be utilized by other packets without in-order requirements while there are no in-order packets. Second, even in-order packets can benefit from in-network reorder buffers by enjoying more shares of reorder buffers than before. Such an increase in reorder buffer utilization enables NoC performance improvement while supporting the original in-order requirements. Experimental results with an industrial strength DTV SoC example show that the presented idea improves the total execution cycle by 16.9%.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090821","","Access protocols;Bandwidth;Codecs;Concurrent computing;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Large scale integration;Network-on-a-chip;Parallel processing;System-on-a-chip","buffer circuits;network routing;network-on-chip;power consumption","3D die stacking;3D graphics;DTV SoC;NoC performance;in-network reorder buffer;in-order packets;multiple memories;network routers;parallel memory;pixel processing;power consumption","","6","","17","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","1428","1433","With the trend toward high-quality large form factor displays on high-end handhelds, LCD backlight accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of the total energy budget. Substantial energy savings can be achieved by dynamically adapting backlight intensity levels while compensating for the ensuing visual quality degradation with image pixel transformations. Several compensation techniques have been recently developed to this purpose, but none of them has been fully characterized in terms of quality losses considering jointly the non-idealities present in a real embedded video chain and the peculiar characteristics of the human visual system (HVS). We have developed a quality analysis framework based on an accurate embedded visualization system model and HVS-aware metrics. We use it to assess the visual quality performance of existing dynamic backlight scaling (DBS) solutions. Experimental results show that none of the DBS techniques available today is fully capable of keeping quality loss under control, and that there is significant room for improvement in this direction.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090888","","Degradation;Energy consumption;Humans;Liquid crystal devices;Liquid crystal displays;Mathematical model;Optical distortion;Pixel;Satellite broadcasting;Visual system","liquid crystal displays;vision","LCD systems;dynamic backlight scaling;high-quality large form factor displays;human visual system;visual quality analysis","","4","","15","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the garbage collection for invalid pages in flash memory can invoke a long blocking time. Moreover, the worst-case blocking time is significantly long compared to the best-case blocking time under the current flash management techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel Flash Translation Layer (FTL), called KAST, where user can configure the maximum log block associativity to control the worst-case blocking time. Performance evaluation using simulations shows that the overall performance of KAST is better than the current FTL schemes as well as KAST guarantees the longest block time is shorter than the specified value.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090717","","Digital audio players;Digital cameras;Electric shock;Energy consumption;Flash memory;Fluctuations;Hard disks;Ice;Power system management;Real time systems","NAND circuits;flash memories;low-power electronics;real-time systems;storage management","K-associative sector translation;KAST;NAND flash memory;best-case blocking time;flash management technique;flash translation layer;garbage collection;high shock resistance;low power consumption;maximum log block associativity configuration;nonfluctuating performance;real-time system;worst-case blocking time","","14","","8","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Improving yield and reliability of chip multiprocessors","Pan, A.; Khan, O.; Kundu, S.","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition, 2009. DATE '09.","20090623","2009","","","490","495","An increasing number of hardware failures can be attributed to device reliability problems that cause partial system failure or shutdown. In this paper we propose a scheme for improving reliability of a homogeneous chip multiprocessor (CMP) that also serves to improve manufacturing yield. Our solution centers on exploiting the natural redundancy that already exists in multi-core systems by using services from other cores for functional units that are defective in a faulty core. A micro-architectural modification allows a core on a CMP to use another core as a coprocessor to service any instruction that the former cannot execute correctly. This service is accessed to improve yield and reliability, but at the cost of some loss of performance. In order to quantify this loss we have used a cycle-accurate simulator to simulate the performance of a dual-core system with one or two cores sustaining partial failure. Our results indicate that when a large and sparingly-used unit such as a floating point arithmetic unit fails in a core, even for a floating point intensive benchmark, we can continue to run each faulty core with help from companion cores with as little as 10% impact to performance and less than 1% area overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090714","micorarchitecture;multiprocessors;reliability;yield","Costs;Frequency;Hardware;Niobium compounds;Performance loss;Redundancy;Stress;Temperature;Titanium compounds;Voltage","floating point arithmetic;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","cycle-accurate simulator;device reliability problem;dual-core system;faulty core;floating point arithmetic unit;hardware failure;homogeneous chip multiprocessor;manufacturing yield;microarchitectural modification;multicore system;natural redundancy;partial system failure;partial system shutdown","","7","","29","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed the sensing quality factor is a key parameter for the micro mechanical gyroscope dynamic; particularly high sensing quality factor means long settling time, high response overshoot and high sensitivity to external disturbances (shocks and vibrations) that are typical of harsh automotive environment. For this reason micro mechanical gyroscopes employed in automotive environment need high shock and vibration immunity. This paper proposes a solution to reach this goal by adding a ldquovirtual dampingrdquo to the system with an electrostatic feedback technique.
