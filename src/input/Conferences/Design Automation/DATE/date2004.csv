"Evaluation of an object-oriented hardware design methodology for automotive applications","Bannow, N.; Haug, K.","Autom.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","3","","268","273 Vol.3","In this paper we present results in using the new object-oriented design approach OSSS (ODETTE system synthesis subset). The methodology and tools of the ODETTE (object-oriented co-design and functional test techniques) project have been developed within the context of the IST programme of the European Commission. Main focus of OSSS lies in the field of hardware design and in synthesis capability. The strategy is based on an extension of the synthesizable subset of standard systemC. The approach supports real object-oriented and synthesizable design features like classes, inheritance, templates, polymorphism and global object access. Therefore OSSS promises high efficiency in sense of capability to handle complex designs, faster development time, improved code quality and faster time to market. In contrast, standard systemC is also based on C++ constructs, but no object-oriented constructs are available yet for a synthesizable system description. We have evaluated OSSS on an automotive design example. It was chosen for the implementation of a component that is part of all video projects: A camera's exposure control unit (ExpoCU). The first main goal that was achieved is a synthesizable design by the automatic generation of an FPGA netlist from an OSSS description. Furthermore we have also proved the methodology to fulfill industrial requirements such as usability for complex system development, integration of existing IP, improved code quality and decreased development effort. Comparison will be done against existing VHDL based design flow. We especially focus on the implementation and testability by comparing the new object-oriented synthesis approach with a standard VHDL flow by laying emphasis on synthesizability. OSSS and equivalent kinds of methodology show a large potential to handle new generations of complex HW-SW systems. Moreover the gap between increasing design complexity and available methodologies already now gets bigger and bigger and thus needs to be closed by new solutions such as OSSS.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269247","","Automatic control;Automotive applications;Automotive engineering;Control system synthesis;Design methodology;Electrical equipment industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Testing;Time to market","C++ language;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;object-oriented methods","C++ constructs;FPGA netlist;ODETTE system synthesis subset;VHDL based design flow;automotive design;cameras exposure control unit;complex system development;field programmable gate array;global object access;hardware description languages;object oriented codesign and functional test techniques;object oriented hardware design;polymorphism;standard systemC","","0","","14","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","3","","332","333 Vol.3","VHDL is a critical language for RTL design and is a major component of the $200+ million RTL simulation market. Many users prefer to use VHDL for RTL design as the language continues to provide desired characteristics in design safety, flexibility and maintainability. While VHDL has provided significant value for digital designers since 1987, it has had only one significant language revision in 1993. It has taken many years for design state-of-practice to catch-up to and, in some cases, surpass the capabilities that have been available in VHDL for over 15 years. Last year, the VHDL analysis and standardization group (VASG), which is responsible for the VHDL standard, received clear indication from the VHDL community that it was now time to look at enhancing VHDL. In response to the user community, VASG initiated the VHDL-200x project. VHDL-200x will result in at least two revisions of the VHDL standard. The first revision is planned to be completed next year (2004) and will include a C language interface (VHPI); a collection of high user value enhancements to improve designer productivity and modeling capability and potential inclusion of assertion-based verification and testbench modeling enhancements. A second revision is planned to follow about2 years later.

Today designers have access to a variety of specialized IP blocks and cells for use in SoC design flows. Complex I/O appear in a myriad of standards such as USB 1.0/1.1/2.0, IEEE 1394 a/b (firewire), SSTL, HSTL, PCl-X, LVDS, and more. These new standards are driven by consumer's demand for bandwidth and capability, and the industry's desire to reuse proven design blocks in vastly different applications and domains. Integration of these specialized IP blocks introduces increased complexity to design flows. For example, digital designs must now consider the analog like properties of some complex I/O. This paper discusses the uniqueness of embedding complex I/O in a SoC. The features and properties that differentiate complex I/O from standard design practices will be described.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","3","","126","131 Vol.3","System level modeling with executable languages such as C/C++ has been crucial in the development of large electronic systems from general processors to application specific designs. To make sure that the executable models behave as they should, the designers often have to ""eye-ball"" the simulation traces and at best, apply simple ""assert"" statements or write simple trace checkers in some scripting languages. The problem is the lack of a concise and formal method to specify and check desired properties, whether they be functional or performance in nature. In this paper, we apply assertion checking methodology to the system design of network processors. Functional and performance assertions, based on linear temporal logic and logic of constraints, are written during the design process. Trace checkers and simulation monitors are automatically generated to validate particular simulation runs or to analyze their performance characteristics. Several categories of assertions are checked throughout the design process, such as equivalence, functionality, transaction, and performance. We demonstrate that the assertion-based methodology is very useful for both system level verification and design exploration.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269218","","Analytical models;Automata;Character generation;Design methodology;Embedded software;Laboratories;Logic design;Performance analysis;Process design;System-level design","computer networks;formal verification;systems analysis;temporal logic","C language;C++ language;assertion based methodology;electronic systems;executable languages;formal assertions;formal method;linear temporal logic;network processor system design;scripting languages;system level modeling;system level verification","","4","1","11","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","3","","180","185 Vol.3","In this paper we analyse some methodological concerns that have to be faced in a design flow which contains automatic synthesis phases from high-level, system descriptions. In particular, the issues related to the synthesis of the communication between the system elements are considered. The context in which the analysis is performed is the design flow proposed in the ODETTE project: in this ambient, systemC is exploited in order to provide efficient system-level models; after that, the systemC+ systemC subset and extensions can be used to get a refined description that, despite the use of object oriented features such as polymorphism and inheritance, can be automatically synthesised by means of the ODETTE tools. Still, the problem of interfacing the hardware synthesised with the other elements of the design (memories, peripherals) remains an important issue. In order to face this problem, we propose a pattern that can be used to design bus interfaces that allow both an high level of abstraction in the communication on the ""user"" side, and automatic synthesis by the ODETTE tools. In order to do this, OSSS global objects are exploited to implement the communication between the application and the interface. After presenting the general methodology, a specific library interface is presented, that could connect the device under design to a PCI bus. In order to prove the viability of the approach, an example of synthesis of an example, from the system level down to the RT level is performed.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269227","","Context modeling;Design methodology;Hardware;Libraries;Object oriented modeling;Performance analysis;Protocols;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Technological innovation","high level synthesis;object-oriented methods;peripheral interfaces;systems analysis","PCI bus;bus interface design;high level communication synthesis;object oriented features;peripheral component interconnect bus;systemC subset;systemC+ subset","","0","1","5","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our technique leaves many don't-care bits unchanged in the compressed test set, and these bits can be filled randomly to detect non-modeled faults.

For example, FIFOs and flow-control are needed for Network-on-Chip, high performance ASICs and multiple clock domain designs. These IC implementation architectures require an efficient methodology to determine the size of the FIFOs in the channel since the FIFO sizes affect system performance. In this work we devised a methodology to size the FIFOs in an interconnect channel containing one or more FIFOs connected in series. We show that the sizing of the FIFOs in the channel is a function of system parameters such as data production rate and consumption rate, data burstiness, number of channel stages etc. and we also quantify their effect on performance. For a single clock design, we have developed an efficient algorithm which reduces the search space for the optimal sizing of the FIFOs in the channel.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269045","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific integrated circuits;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Clocks;Delay;Design methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Network-on-a-chip;Protocols","buffer storage;clocks;integrated circuit design;queueing theory;system-on-chip","FIFO;application specific integrated circuit;data burstiness;data consumption rate;data production rate;first in first out queues;flow control;high performance ASIC;high performance integrated circuit;interconnect channel design;multiple clock domain design;network on-chip;on-chip communication;queueing network;storage buffer","","11","133","21","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","988","993 Vol.2","Energy efficient embedded systems consist of a heterogeneous collection of very specific building blocks, connected together by a complex network of many dedicated busses and interconnect options. The trend to merge multiple functions into one device makes the design and integration of these ""systems-on-chip"" (SOC's) even more problematic. Yet, specifications and applications are never fixed and require the embedded units to be programmable. The topic of this paper is to give the designer architectures and design techniques to find the right balance between energy efficiency and flexibility. The key is to include programmability (or reconfiguration) at the right level of abstraction and tuned to the application domain. The challenge is to provide an exploration and programming environment for this heterogeneous architecture platform.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269022","","Cellular phones;Complex networks;Decoding;Digital signal processing;Embedded system;Energy efficiency;Finite impulse response filter;Global Positioning System;Multimedia systems;Programming environments","digital signal processing chips;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;reconfigurable architectures;system-on-chip","DSP;SOC;busses;digital signal processor;energy efficient embedded systems;heterogeneous architecture platform;multimedia processing;programmability;system-on-chip","","2","","19","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","810","815 Vol.2","This paper presents an experimental investigation on the impact of test point insertion on circuit size and performance. Often test points are inserted into a circuit in order to improve the circuit's testability, which results in smaller test data volume, shorter test time, and higher fault coverage. Inserting test points however requires additional silicon area and influences the timing of a circuit. The paper shows how placement and routing is affected by test point insertion during layout generation. Experimental data for industrial circuits show that inserting 1% test points in general increases the silicon area after layout by less than 0.5% while the performance of the circuit may be reduced by 5% or more.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268981","","Automatic testing;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Integrated circuit testing;Laboratories;Logic testing;Routing;Silicon;Timing","circuit layout;flip-flops;logic testing","circuits testability;industrial circuits;silicon area;test point insertion","","1","","12","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experimental results show that loop shifting is particularly effective for the synthesis of designs with complex control especially when resource utilization is already high and/or under tight resource constraints. In situations when further loop unrolling (or initiating another iteration of the loop body) leads to a sharp increase in the longest combinational path in the circuit and the circuit area, loop shifting is able to achieve up to 20% reduction in the input-to-output delay in the synthesized circuit. We implemented loop shifting within the SPARK parallelizing high-level synthesis framework and present results for experiments on designs derived from multimedia and image processing applications.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268836","","Circuit synthesis;Compaction;Control systems;Delay;Embedded system;High level synthesis;Image processing;Multimedia systems;Resource management;Sparks","high level synthesis;logic design","SPARK;complex control flow;embedded system;high-level synthesis;image processing;input-to-output delay;loop compaction;loop level parallelism;loop shifting;multimedia processing;resource utilization;synthesized circuit","","8","","19","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number of tester channels with high data rates may be constrained in practice however due to ATE resource limitations, the power rating of the SOC, and scan frequency limits for the embedded cores. Therefore, we formulate the following optimization problem: given two available data rates for the tester channels, an SOC-level test access mechanism (TAM) width W, V (V < W) channels that can transport test data at the higher data rate, determine an SOC TAM architecture that minimizes the testing time.

The nondeterministic synchronization used by most GALS architectures makes chip-level silicon debug and functional test difficult and costly. Deterministic GALS methodologies make dataflow assumptions which are only valid for a very limited set of applications. This paper describes a novel deterministic GALS methodology called ""synchro-tokens"" whose parameterized wrappers are flexible enough to be useful for a wide range of applications while supporting synchronous debug and test methodologies such as 1149.1 and P1500.

One approach to achieve this task is to embed the message in an innocent-looking cover-media. In our model, the message contents are scattered in the cover in a certain way that is based on a secret key known only to the sender and receiver. Therefore, even if the warden discovers the existence of the message, he will not be able to recover it. In other words a covert or subliminal communication channel is opened between two persons who possess a secret key to reassemble its contents.

Configurability, however, imposes more challenges upon designers because complexity involved in optimization increases exponentially as the number of parameters grows. In this paper, we present a novel approach with which effort requirement can be dramatically reduced. An automated optimization tool we developed is used and it exploits a genetic algorithm for fast design exploration.

Secondly, TDMA power amplifiers usually have a control voltage to operate the device in various modes of operation. At each of the control voltage values, all the specifications of the power amplifier are measured to ensure the performance of each tested device. A new method is proposed to test all the specifications of these devices using the transient current response of their bias circuits to a time-varying control voltage stimulus. These results in shorter test times compared to conventional test methods. The test specification values are measured to an accuracy of less than 5% for all the specifications measured. The proposed test approach can specifically benefit production test of quad-band amplifiers (GSM850, GSM900, PCS/DCS), as a single transient current measurement can be used to compute all the specifications of the device in different modes of operation, over different operating frequencies.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268861","","Circuit testing;Costs;Current measurement;Frequency;Operational amplifiers;Power amplifiers;System testing;Time division multiple access;Transmitters;Voltage control","HF amplifiers;electric current measurement;integrated circuit testing;power amplifiers;time division multiple access;transients","GSM850;GSM900;PCS-DCS;TDMA power amplifiers;bias circuits;high frequency testers;operating frequencies;production test;quad-band amplifiers;test specification values;time-varying control voltage stimulus;transient current measurements;transient current response;transmitter system","","2","1","10","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the significant advances in the VLSI technology, there is an increasing demand for portable multimedia appliances capable of handling advanced algorithms required in all forms of communication. Over the years, we have witnessed a steady move from standalone (or desktop) multimedia to deeply distributed multimedia systems. Whereas desktop-based systems are mainly optimized based on the performance constraints, power consumption is the key design constraint for multimedia devices that draw their energy from batteries. The overall goal of successful design is then to find the best mapping of the target multimedia application onto the architectural resources, while satisfying an imposed set of design constraints (e.g. minimum power dissipation, maximum performance) and specified QoS metrics (e.g. end-to-end latency, jitter, loss rate) which directly impact the media quality. This paper addresses a few fundamental issues that make the design process particularly challenging and offers a holistic perspective towards a coherent design methodology.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269081","","Batteries;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Home appliances;Humans;Multimedia systems;Performance loss;Power dissipation;Very large scale integration","VLSI;multimedia systems;power consumption;protocols;quality of service","QoS;VLSI technology;coherent design;design constraint;desktop based systems;distributed multimedia systems;multimedia devices;power consumption;quality of services;standalone multimedia system;very large scale integration","","1","","34","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the skewed-load approach whose design requirement is often too costly to meet due to the fast switching scan enable signal, the hybrid delay scan does not require a strong buffer or buffer tree to drive the fast switching scan enable signal. Hardware overhead added to standard scan designs to implement the hybrid approach is negligible. Since the fast scan enable signal is internally generated, no external pin is required. Transition delay fault coverage achieved by the hybrid approach is equal to or higher than that achieved by the broad-side load for all ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits.

We first provide an analysis of the parameters of the AMBA bus and the communication protocols and a bus power model that will be used by various transformations. Several latency improving and power minimizing transformations are presented at the bus level. Finally, a heuristic is presented which applies the above transformations in a certain order to provide minimum power under a given latency constraint.

Further, matrix reduction rules appropriate to the new formulation, which do not affect the optimality of the solution, are introduced. Finally, the reduced problem is minimized with a branch & bound algorithm. Experiments on a large number of test sets show significant reductions to the original problem by simply using the presented reduction rules.

This paper presents our approach to take advantage of the increasing integration of technology for analog interfacing in SoC's, by converting the statistics of the signal.

The library is based on a general and systematic methodology that takes as input the original SystemC source code without any modification and provides the estimation parameters by simply including the library within a usual simulation. As a consequence, the same models of computation used during system design are preserved and all simulation conditions are maintained. The method exploits the advantages of dynamic analysis, that is, easy management of unpredictable data-dependent conditions and computational efficiency compared with other alternatives (ISS or RT simulation, without the need for SW generation and compilation and HW synthesis). Results obtained on several examples show the accuracy of the method.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","480","485 Vol.1","In previous work, we showed the benefits and feasibility of having a processor dynamically partition its executing software such that critical software kernels are transparently partitioned to execute as a hardware coprocessor on configurable logic - an approach we call warp processing. The configurable logic place and route step is the most computationally intensive part of such hardware/software partitioning, normally running for many minutes or hours on powerful desktop processors. In contrast, dynamic partitioning requires place and route to execute in just seconds and on a lean embedded processor. We have therefore designed a configurable logic architecture specifically for dynamic hardware/software partitioning. Through experiments with popular benchmarks, we show that by specifically focusing on the goal of software kernel speedup when designing the FPGA architecture, rather than on the more general goal of ASIC prototyping, we can perform place and route for our architecture 50 times faster, using 10,000 times less data memory, and 1,000 times less code memory, than popular commercial tools mapping to commercial configurable logic. Yet, we show that we obtain speedups (2x on average, and as much as 4x) and energy savings (33% on average, and up to 74%) when partitioning even just one loop, which are comparable to commercial tools and fabrics. Thus, our configurable logic architecture represents a good candidate for platforms that will support dynamic hardware/software partitioning, and enables ultra-fast desktop tools for hardware/software partitioning, and even for fast configurable logic design in general.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268892","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer architecture;Coprocessors;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Kernel;Logic design;Software performance;Software prototyping;Software tools","dynamic programming;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;just-in-time;logic partitioning;reconfigurable architectures;system-on-chip","ASIC prototyping;FPGA architecture;FPGA fabric;configurable logic architecture;desktop processors;dynamic optimization;dynamic partitioning;embedded processor;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software partitioning;just-in-time compilation;processor partitioning;reconfigurable computing;software kernel;software kernels;system-on-chip;warp processing","","17","2","33","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","1244","1249 Vol.2","In multiprocessor based SoCs, optimizing the communication architecture is often as important, if not more important, than optimizing the computation architecture. While there are mature platforms and techniques for the modeling and evaluation of architectures of processing elements, the same is not true for the communication architectures. This paper presents an application-driven retargetable prototyping platform which fills this gap. This environment aims to facilitate the design exploration of the communication sub-system through application-level execution-driven simulations and quantitative analysis. First, we introduce an expressive communication architecture specification which gives the designers the freedom to choose and configure their custom interconnection schemes over a wide range of communication architectures, covering the spectrum from buses to packet switching networks. This, combined with a distributed application model, drives a modular modeling and simulation environment that permits detailed simulation of the communication (and computation) architectures at the application level. Through the case studies motivated by an embedded system application, we show that through simulations, critical system information such as timings and communication patterns can be obtained and evaluated. Consequently, system-level design choices regarding the communication architecture can be made with high confidence in the early stages of design. In addition to improving design quality, this methodology also results in significantly shortening design-time.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269066","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Distributed computing;Drives;Embedded system;Packet switching;Prototypes;System-level design;Timing","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;multiprocessor interconnection networks;packet switching;system-on-chip","SoC;application driven retargetable prototyping platform;application level execution driven simulation;communication architecture specification;communication pattern;communication subsystem;distributed application model;embedded system;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;interconnection scheme;modular modeling;multiprocessor;packet switching networks;quantitative analysis;system level design;system-on-chip;timing","","4","","20","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","3","","336","337 Vol.3","Main concerns related to post-layout simulation, today, are about the format of the netlist coming out from the parasitic extractor. In fact, such a netlist is usually flat so that readability, whether compared to the pre-layout hierarchical one, is very poor due to device and net names which often change and to the difficulty to compare pre-layout and post-layout output signals. Furthermore, simulating such large flat netlists is frequently time consuming because it is not possible to exploit algorithms like hierarchical array reduction (HAR) and isomorphic matching (IM), strength points of state-of-the-art full chip simulators. In this paper, we present a new approach that, starting from a flat netlist with parasitic components and a pre-layout hierarchical one, allows to create a fully hierarchical post-layout netlist containing device parameters and parasitic components directly extracted from the layout. In this way, a fast and accurate post-layout simulation is made possible by the use of look-up table simulators, taking advantages from the HAR and IM algorithms as mentioned before. This methodology has been integrated in a complete design flow to guarantee first silicon success, cut down time-to-design, improve time-to-market and streamline design quality.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269268","","Automatic testing;Buildings;Charge measurement;Charge pumps;Circuit simulation;Current measurement;Design automation;Silicon;Table lookup;Voltage","SPICE;circuit simulation;table lookup","SPICE;design flow;flat netlist;hierarchical array reduction;hierarchical postlayout netlist;isomorphic matching;lookup table simulators;parasitic extractor;post layout simulation;postlayout output signals;prelayout output signals;simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis;state of the art full chip simulators;time consuming","","0","2","","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key part to this approach is a simple yet accurate power net estimation formula that decides the minimum number of power nets needed to satisfy both power and signal integrity constraints prior to detailed layout. The proposed design methodology is a one-pass solution to the co-design of power and signal networks in the sense that no iteration between them is required in order to meet design closure.

The proposed methodology advocates a successive refinement flow of the system-level models of both the processor cores and the communication architecture.

The concept comes from software engineering in which reuse is a fundamental technology. In order to provide libraries and applications to reuse in software development, some open-source initiatives (e.g. Linux, gcc, X, mysql) have appeared during the last decades. The basic idea is to distribute the library or application source code (normally free-of-charge) and allow any developer to use, modify, debug and improve it. Several initiatives have tried to port this idea to hardware development. The main goal of this paper is to develop a synthesizable platform described in SystemC from an open architecture. The platform includes a CPU (OpenRISC) and some basic peripherals. A set of software development tools (compiler, assembler, debugger) and RTOS (eCos) has also been developed. This work enables the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the open-source model in electronic system design.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269026","","Application software;Costs;Design automation;Microelectronics;Open source software;Programming;Silicon;Software engineering;Software libraries;System-level design","reduced instruction set computing;software reusability;software tools","CPU;RISC;application source code;assembler;central processing unit;compiler;debugger;design complexity;electronic system design;hardware development;international technology roadmap;library source code;open architecture;open source cores;open source initiatives;reduced instruction set computing;software development tools;software engineering;systemC platform","","9","","23","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Random simulation based methods for functional validation suffer from fundamental limitations and may be inappropriate or too expensive. In fact, for some circuits, a large number of vector is required in order to make the circuit reach hard to test constructs and obtains accurate values for their testability. In this work, we present a static, non-simulation based, method for the determination of the controllability of RTL constructs that is efficient and gives accurate feedback to the designers in what regards the presence of hard to control constructs in their RTL code. The method takes as input a Verilog RTL description, solves the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations that describe the steady-state of the circuit and outputs the computed values for the controllability of the RTL constructs. To avoid the exponential blow-up that results from writing one equation for each circuit state and solving the resulting system of equations, an approximation method is used. We present results showing that the approximation is effective and describe how the method can be used to bias a random test generator in order to achieve higher coverage using a smaller number of vectors.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268845","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Controllability;Equations;Feedback;Hardware design languages;Steady-state;Writing","design for testability;formal verification;hardware description languages","Chapman-Kolmogorov equations;RTL constructs;Verilog RTL description;accurate feedback;approximation method;circuit design process;controllability;functional validation;probabilistic method;random simulation;random test generator;testability computation","","4","1","17","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A single-path deterministic routing between the cores places high bandwidth demands on the links. The bandwidth requirements can be significantly reduced by splitting the traffic between the cores across multiple paths. In this paper, we present NMAP, a fast algorithm that maps the cores onto a mesh NoC architecture under bandwidth constraints, minimizing the average communication delay. The NMAP algorithm is presented for both single minimum-path routing and split-traffic routing. The algorithm is applied to a benchmark DSP design and the resulting NoC is built and simulated at cycle accurate level in SystemC using macros from the ×pipes library.

Since building sophisticated single processor based systems is a complex process from design, verification, and software development perspectives, the use of chip multiprocessing is inevitable in future microprocessors. In fact, the abundance of explicit loop-level parallelism in many embedded applications helps us identify chip multiprocessing as one of the most promising directions in designing systems for embedded applications. Another architectural trend that we observe in embedded systems, namely, multi-voltage processors, is driven by the need of reducing energy consumption during program execution. Practical implementations such as Transmeta's Crusoe and Intel's XScale tune processor voltage/frequency depending on current execution load. Considering these two trends, chip multiprocessing and voltage/frequency scaling, this paper presents an optimization strategy for an architecture that makes use of both chip parallelism and voltage scaling. In our proposal, the compiler takes advantage of heterogeneity in parallel execution between the loads of different processors and assigns different voltages/frequencies to different processors if doing so reduces energy consumption without increasing overall execution cycles significantly. Our experiments with a set of applications show that this optimization can bring large energy benefits without much performance loss.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269048","","Application software;Buildings;Energy consumption;Frequency;Microprocessors;Process design;Programming;Software design;Transistors;Voltage","embedded systems;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;parallelising compilers;power consumption","Intels XScale tune processor;Transmetas Crusoe;chip multiprocessors;chip parallelism;compiler support;embedded systems;energy consumption reduction;loop level parallelism;multivoltage processors;optimization strategy;parallel execution;processor workload heterogeneity;semiconductor technology;single processor based systems;voltage/frequency scaling","","14","1","21","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While its main assets are modularity and the very fact it is becoming a de facto standard, the evolution of the SystemC framework (from version 0.9 to version 2.0.1) suggests the environment is particularly geared toward increasing the framework functionalities rather than improving simulation speed. For cycle-level simulation, speed is a critical factor as simulation can be extremely slow, affecting the extent of design space exploration. In this article, we present a fast SystemC engine that, in our experience, can speed up simulations by a factor of 1.93 to 3.56 over SystemC 2.0.1. This SystemC engine is designed for cycle-level simulators and for the moment, it only supports the subset of the SystemC syntax (signals, methods) that is most often used for such simulators. We achieved greater speed (1) by completely rewriting the SystemC engine and improving the implementation software engineering, and (2) by proposing a new scheduling technique, intermediate between SystemC dynamic scheduling technique and existing static scheduling schemes.

In this paper, we propose a scan chain modification technique that inserts logic gates on the scan path. The consequent beneficial test data transformations are utilized to reduce the scan chain transitions during shift cycles and hence test power. We introduce a matrix band algebra that models the impact of logic gate insertion between scan cells on the test stimulus and response transformations realized. As we have successfully modeled the response transformations as well, the methodology we propose is capable of truly minimizing the overall test power.

As a result, power-delivery design without thermal consideration may cause soft-error, reliability degradation, and even premature chip failures. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware power-delivery optimization algorithm. By simultaneously considering thermal and power integrity, we are able to achieve high power supply quality and thermal reliability.

Customizing a microprocessor cache's total size, line size and associativity to a particular program is well known to have tremendous benefits for performance and power. Customizing caches has until recently been restricted to core-based flows, in which a new chip will be fabricated. However, several configurable cache architectures have been proposed recently for use in pre-fabricated microprocessor platforms. Tuning those caches to a program is still however a cumbersome task left for designers, assisted in part by recent computer-aided design (CAD) tuning aids. We propose to move that CAD on-chip, which can greatly increase the acceptance of configurable caches. We introduce on-chip hardware implementing an efficient cache tuning heuristic that can automatically, transparently, and dynamically tune the cache to an executing program. We carefully designed the heuristic to avoid any cache flushing, since flushing is power and performance costly. By simulating numerous Powerstone and MediaBench benchmarks, we show that such a dynamic self-tuning cache can reduce memory-access energy by 45% to 55% on average, and as much as 97%, compared with a four-way set-associative base cache, completely transparently to the programmer.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268840","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer science;Design automation;Embedded system;Energy dissipation;Hardware;Logic;Microprocessors;Power engineering and energy;Tuning","cache storage;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;embedded systems;low-power electronics;memory architecture;reconfigurable architectures","CAD tuning aids;MediaBench benchmarks;Powerstone;architecture tuning;cache flushing;cache tuning;computer-aided design;configurable cache architectures;core-based flows;dynamic optimization;dynamic self-tuning cache;embedded systems;four-way set-associative base cache;line size;memory access;memory-access energy;microprocessor cache;on-chip hardware;power consumption;prefabricated microprocessor platforms;self-tuning cache architecture","","11","1","14","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The task of automatically matching candidate instructions in an application (e.g. written in a high-level language) to a pre-designed library of extensible instructions is especially challenging. Previous approaches have focused on identifying extensible instructions (e.g. through profiling), synthesizing extensible instructions, estimating expected performance gains etc. In this paper we introduce our approach of automatically matching extensible instructions as this key step is missing in automating the entire design flow of an ASIP with extensible instruction capabilities. Since matching using simulation is practically infeasible (simulation time), and traditional pattern matching approaches would not yield reliable results (ambiguity related to a functionally equivalent code that can be represented in many different ways), we adopt combinational equivalence checking. Our MINCE tool as part of our ASIP design flow consists of a translator, a filtering algorithm and a combinational equivalence checking tool. We report matching times of extensible instructions that are 7.3x faster on average (using Mediabench applications) compared to the best known approaches to the problem (partial simulations). In all our experiments MINCE matched correctly and the outcome of the matching step yielded an average speedup of the application of 2.47x. As a summary, our work represents a key step towards automating the whole design flow of an ASIP with extensible instruction capabilities.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269027","","Application software;Application specific processors;Australia;Computer science;Design engineering;Embedded system;Libraries;National electric code;Pattern matching;Space exploration","application specific integrated circuits;combinational circuits;instruction sets;integrated circuit design","application specific instruction set processor design;automatically matching candidate instructions;combinational equivalence checking;computationally complex task;custom extensible instructions;extensible processor;filtering algorithm;high level language;pattern matching","","9","","29","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","784","789 Vol.2","High-performance digital circuits are facing increasingly severe noise problems due to cross-coupled noise injection. Traditionally, noise analysis tools use the conservative assumption that all neighbors of a net can switch simultaneously, producing the worst-case noise. However, due to logic correlations in the circuit, this worst-case noise may not be realizable, resulting in a so-called false noise failure. Some techniques for computing logic correlations have been designed targeting static CMOS circuits. However high performance microprocessors commonly use domino logic for their ALU. The domino circuits have lower noise margins than static CMOS circuits and are more sensitive to coupled noise. Any unnecessary pessimism of the noise analysis tool results in large number of false noise violations and either requires additional extensive SPICE simulations or circuit over-design. Unfortunately false noise analysis developed for static CMOS circuits fails to compute many logic correlations in domino circuits. In this paper we propose a novel technique of computing logic correlations in domino circuits. It takes into account the fact that both pull up and pull down networks of a domino gate can be in non conducting state. The proposed technique generates additional logic correlations for such states of domino gates. In order to improve the capability of logic correlation derivation technique we combine the resolution method with recursive learning algorithm. The proposed technique is implemented in an industrial noise analysis tool and tested on high performance ALU blocks.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268975","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268975","","CMOS logic circuits;Circuit analysis;Circuit noise;Coupling circuits;Digital circuits;Logic circuits;Logic design;Microprocessors;SPICE;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;digital circuits;integrated circuit noise;logic circuits;logic gates","ALU blocks;SPICE simulations;arithmetic logic unit;complementary metal oxide semiconductor;cross coupled noise injection;digital circuits;domino circuits;domino gate;false noise analysis tools;industrial noise analysis tool;logic correlations;nonconducting state;pull down networks;pull up networks;recursive learning algorithm;resolution method;simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis;static CMOS circuits;worst case noise","","1","","12","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Adding a victim buffer to the memory hierarchy is known to reduce energy and improve performance on average, yet victim buffers are not typically found in commercial embedded processors. One problem with such buffers is, while they work well on average, they tend to hurt performance for many applications. We show that a victim buffer can be very effective if it is considered as a parameter in designing a memory hierarchy, like the traditional cache parameters of total size, associativity, and line size. We describe experiments on PowerStone and MediaBench benchmarks, showing that having the option of adding a victim buffer to a direct-mapped cache can reduce memory-access energy by a factor of 3 in some cases. Furthermore, even when other cache parameters are configurable, we show that a victim buffer can still reduce energy by 43%. By treating the victim buffer as a parameter, meaning the buffer can be included or excluded, we can avoid performance overhead of up to 4% on some examples. We discuss the victim buffer in the context of both core-based and pre-fabricated platform based design approaches.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268852","","Application software;Computer science;Degradation;Delta modulation;Design engineering;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Power engineering and energy","application specific integrated circuits;buffer circuits;cache storage;memory architecture","MediaBench benchmarks;PowerStone;application-specific memory hierarchy;cache parameters;core-based platform;direct-mapped cache;embedded system design;line size;memory-access energy;performance overhead;prefabricated platform;victim buffer","","2","","13","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major aspect of the resulting electrical models is that they allow the designer to evaluate the wide bus from the three viewpoints of signal timing, crosstalk (both inductive and capacitive), and common-mode signal integrity. Another major aspect is that they take into account such important high-frequency phenomena as the dependence of the current return-path resistance on frequencies.

Previous works (Koorapaty et al., 2003; Koorapaty, 2003; Pileggi et al., 2003) showed that by employing even limited heterogeneity for the VPGA logic blocks, namely combining a 3-LUT with two 3-input Nand gates, one can achieve performance comparable to that provided by standard cells.

Generally, the implementation of high speed transceivers is a typical domain of a full custom design style because the timing critical parts are realized by dedicated transistor level design of the PLL/DLL based architectures. Compared to this method, the design productivity can be enhanced significantly, with the usage of this soft IP macro. With the presented implementation, data rates of about 1 GBit/s can be achieved.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","130","135 Vol.1","In very deep sub-micron designs, cross coupling capacitances become the dominant factor of the total bus loading and have a significant impact on the power consumption. In this paper, we propose two reconfigurable bus encoding schemes, which are based on the correlation among the bit lines, to reduce the power consumption at the cross coupling capacitances of the instruction buses. The instruction is encoded by flipping and reordering the bit lines during compilation time to reduce the total switching capacitances. A crossbar is used to map back the data to the original instruction code before sending to the instruction decoder. The reordering can be re-configured during run-time by using different configurations in the crossbar. We propose two types of re-configuration, static and dynamic. Static coding uses a fix flipping and re-configuring pattern after the corresponding program is compiled. Dynamic coding allows different re-configuring patterns during program execution. Experimental results show that by using the proposed schemes, significant energy reduction, 17-23%, can be achieved. Comparisons with existing bit lines reordering encoding scheme have also been made and on average more than 15% reduction can be obtained using our method.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268838","","Capacitance;Decoding;Design engineering;Dynamic compiler;Encoding;Energy consumption;Power engineering and energy;Runtime;Statistics;System-on-a-chip","capacitance;circuit layout CAD;encoding;low-power electronics;reconfigurable architectures;system buses","bit line flipping;bit line reordering;bus loading;compilation time;cross coupling capacitance;crossbar;deep sub-micron instruction bus;dynamic coding;dynamic reconfiguration;fix flipping;instruction decoder;power consumption;program execution;reconfigurable bus encoding scheme;reconfiguring pattern;run-time;static coding;static reconfiguration;switching capacitances","","6","","10","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","36","41 Vol.1","Bounded model checking (BMC) has gained widespread industrial use due to its relative scalability. Its exhaustiveness over all valid input vectors allows it to expose arbitrarily complex design flaws. However, BMC is limited to analyzing only a specific time window, hence will only expose those flaws which manifest within that window and thus connect readily prove correctness. The diameter of a design has thus become an important concept - a bounded check of depth equal to the diameter constitutes a complete proof. While the diameter of a design may be exponential in the number of its state elements, in practice it often ranges from tens to a few hundred regardless of design size. Therefore, a powerful diameter overapproximation technique may enable automatic proofs that otherwise would be infeasible. Unfortunately, exact diameter calculation requires exponential resources, and overapproximation techniques may yield exponentially loose bounds. In this paper, we provide a general approach for enabling the use of structural transformations, such as redundancy removal, retiming, and target enlargement, to tighten the bounds obtained by arbitrary diameter approximation techniques. Numerous experiments demonstrate that this approach may significantly increase the set of designs for which practically useful diameter bounds may be obtained.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268824","","Computational complexity;Design methodology;Formal verification;Hardware;Performance analysis;Polynomials;Reachability analysis;Scalability;Yield estimation","approximation theory;computability;formal verification;state-space methods","BMC;arbitrary diameter approximation;bounded model checking;diameter overapproximation;enhanced diameter bounding;exact diameter calculation;exponential resources;redundancy removal;relative scalability;retiming;structural transformation;target enlargement","","0","","27","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These fault pairs do not need to be considered during diagnostic fault simulation or test generation. We demonstrate that benchmark circuits as well as industrial circuits have these characteristics to a larger extent than may be expected. As a result, only small percentages of fault pairs need to be considered during diagnostic fault simulation or test generation once a fault detection test set is available.

In this work, we show that time-domain information obtained from wavelet analysis of supply current can be used to efficiently trim analog filters. The pole/zero locations in the frequency response of analog filters shift due to change in component values with process variations. Wavelet analysis of supply current can be a promising alternative to test frequency specification of analog filters, since it needs only one test stimulus and is virtually unaffected by transistor threshold variation. Simulation results on two test circuits demonstrate that we can estimate pole/zero shift with less than 3% error.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268941","","Circuit testing;Current supplies;Filters;Fourier transforms;Frequency;Poles and zeros;Signal resolution;Time domain analysis;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms;continuous time filters;poles and zeros;power supply circuits;wavelet transforms","Fourier transform;IDD;analog filters;dynamic supply current;frequency specification;pole-zero shift;supply current analysis;time-domain information;transistor threshold;trim bit setting;wavelet transform;wavelet-based analysis","","0","","4","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automation is achieved by reducing the WEB-refinement proof obligation to a formula in the logic of counter arithmetic with lambda expressions and uninterpreted functions (CLU). We use the tool UCLID to transform the resulting CLU formula into a Boolean formula, which is then checked with a SAT solver. The models we verify include features such as out of order completion, precise exceptions, branch prediction, and interrupts. We use two types of refinement maps. In one, flushing is used to map pipelined machine states to instruction set architecture states; in the other, we use the commitment approach, which is the dual of flushing, since partially completed instructions are invalidated. We present experimental results for all the machines modelled, including verification times. For our application, we found that the time spent proving liveness accounts for about 5% of the over-all verification time.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268844","","Arithmetic;Automation;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Counting circuits;Educational institutions;Electrical safety;Logic;Predictive models;Service oriented architecture","bisimulation equivalence;computer architecture;formal verification;microprocessor chips;pipeline arithmetic","Boolean formula;CLU;SAT solver;UCLID;WEB refinements;XScale-like processor models;automatic verification;branch prediction;counter arithmetic;flushing;instruction set architecture models;lambda expressions;liveness;out of order completion;pipelined machine models;proof obligation;refinement maps;safety;uninterpreted functions;well-founded equivalence bisimulation","","12","","22","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presently, optimization for manufacturability is performed at a post-synthesis stage and has been shown capable of reducing manufacturing cost up to 10%. As in other cases, raising the abstraction layer where optimization is applied is expected to yield substantial gains. This paper focuses on a new approach to design for manufacturability: logic synthesis for manufacturability. This methodology consists of replacing the traditional area-driven technology mapping with a new manufacturability-driven one. We leverage existing logic synthesis tools to test our method. The results obtained by using STMicroelectronics 0.13 μm library confirm that this approach is a promising solution for designing circuits with lower manufacturing cost, while retaining performance. Finally, we show that our synthesis for manufacturability can achieve even larger cost reduction when yield-optimized cells are added to the library, thus enabling a wider area-yield tradeoff exploration.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268978","","Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Cost function;Design for manufacture;Design optimization;Libraries;Logic design;Logic testing;Manufacturing processes;Pulp manufacturing","circuit optimisation;cost reduction;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;logic design","cost reduction;integrated circuit design;logic synthesis;manufacturability;manufacturing cost;nanometer technology;optimization;post synthesis stage;technology mapping","","6","","12","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As random LDPC codes are the most powerful, we abstain from making simplifying assumptions about the LDPC code which could ease the routing problem. We avoid the routing congestion problem by going for multiple independent sequential decoding machines, each decoding separate received codewords.

For this reason, design parameters such as timing, area or power consumption cannot be taken into consideration accurately during design space exploration. Design automation tools currently used to bridge this gap are either limited in the flexibility provided or only generate fragments of the architecture. This paper presents a synthesis tool which preserves the full flexibility of the architecture description language LISA, while being able to generate the complete architecture on RT-level using systemC.

One subsystem of a multimedia terminal that accounts for a considerable amount of the total power consumption is the display unit. The backlight is the major culprit there. As new display units without backlights emerge, the data transfers required to put data on the screen start using up an increasingly important part of the platform's power. We have examined a novel system view that allows for power savings by decreasing the required number of memory accesses to put a frame on the screen. A two-step optimization method for existing platforms is presented. Measurements on a multimedia application show that, on average, power savings of 72% can be obtained on the display related memory accesses. For the proposed optimizations methods to work, it is important that both hardware and software designers become aware of the impact their design-time decisions have on the final power consumption of a system.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269253","","Batteries;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Flat panel displays;Handheld computers;Hardware;Large screen displays;Liquid crystal displays;Optimization methods;Power measurement","liquid crystal displays;multimedia communication;portable instruments;power consumption","display units;handheld devices;handheld user terminals;memory access;multimedia terminals;power consumption;power optimized display memory organization;power savings;two step optimization method","","1","","9","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, they require that a JVM be ported to each such platform. We demonstrate the first Java-to-C compilation strategy that is suitable for a wide range of embedded systems, thereby enabling broad use of Java on embedded platforms. This strategy removes many of the constraints on functionality and reduces code size without sacrificing performance. The compilation framework described is easily retargetable, and is also applicable to bare-bones embedded systems with no operating system or JVM. On an average, we found the size of the generated executables to be over 25 times smaller than those generated by a cutting-edge Java-to-native-code compiler, while providing performance comparable to the best of various Java implementation strategies.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269224","","Automatic testing;Data structures;Design automation;Educational institutions;Embedded system;Europe;Java;Libraries;System testing;Yarn","C language;Java;embedded systems;program compilers;programming languages","C compilation;Java programming language;embedded systems;java virtual machine","","3","1","25","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an automated approach for analyzing these opportunities in a program that allows modification of the program to use custom scratch pad memory configurations comprising a hierarchical set of buffers for local storage of frequently reused data. Using our approach we are able to reduce energy consumption of the memory subsystem when using a scratch pad memory by a factor of two on average compare to a cache of the same size.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268849","","Application software;Buffer storage;Costs;Data analysis;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Storage automation;Streaming media","buffer storage;integrated circuit design;memory architecture;resource allocation","automated approach;buffers;data reuse analysis;energy consumption;frequently reused data;local data transfers;local memory;local storage;main off-chip memory;memory subsystem;multimedia applications;power inefficient transfers;scratch pad memory configurations;software-controlled memory hierarchies;speed inefficient transfers;streaming applications","","19","1","19","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once optimized, the implementation of the non-linear tile-based mapping consumes 60% less power than the implementation of the linear row-major mapping. This result is very interesting because one would normally expect a power penalty in the address generation stage of the more sophisticated tile-based mapping.

We present an automated method for tuning two-level caches to embedded applications for reduced energy consumption. The method is applicable to both a simulation-based exploration environment and a hardware-based system prototyping environment. We introduce the two-level cache tuner, or TCaT - a heuristic for searching the huge solution space of possible configurations. The heuristic interlaces the exploration of the two cache levels and searches the various cache parameters in a specific order based on their impact on energy. We show the integrity of our heuristic across multiple memory configurations and even in the presence of hardware/software partitioning - a common optimization capable of achieving significant speedups and/or reduced energy consumption. We apply our exploration heuristic to a large set of embedded applications. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our heuristic: on average the heuristic examines only 7% of the possible cache configurations, but results in cache sub-system energy savings of 53%, only 1% more than the optimal cache configuration. In addition, the configured cache achieves an average speedup of 30% over the base cache configuration due to tuning of cache line size to the application's needs.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268850","","Application software;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware;Microprocessors;Process design;Runtime;Space exploration;Tuners;Virtual prototyping","cache storage;circuit tuning;embedded systems;memory architecture;microprocessor chips","TCaT;architecture tuning;automatic tuning;base cache configuration;cache hierarchy;cache line size;cache parameters;configurable cache;embedded applications;energy consumption;hardware-based system prototyping environment;hardware-software partitioning;memory hierarchy;microprocessor;multiple memory configurations;simulation-based exploration environment;two-level caches","","35","","21","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Exploiting signal unobservability for efficient translation to CNF in formal verification of microprocessors","Velev, M.N.","","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 2004. Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","266","271 Vol.1","The paper presents a method for translating Boolean circuits to CNF by identifying trees of ITE operators, where each ITE has fanout count of 1, and representing every such tree with a single set of equivalent CNF clauses without intermediate variables for ITE outputs, except for the tree output. This not only eliminates intermediate variables, but also reduces the number of clauses, compared to conventional translation to CNF, where each ITE is assigned an output variable and is represented with a separate set of clauses. Other gates with fanout count of 1 are similarly merged with their fanout gate to generate a single set of equivalent clauses. This translation to CNF was implemented in a decision procedure for the logic of equality with uninterpreted functions and memories (EUFM), and was applied to formulas from formal verification of microprocessors. To increase the number of ITE-trees in the Boolean formulas, the decision procedure was optimized to preserve the ITE-tree structure of arguments to equality comparisons. In conventional translation to CNF with the unoptimized decision procedure, the benchmark formulas require up to hundreds of thousands of CNF variables and millions of clauses. The best translation strategy reduced the CNF variables by up to 8x; the clauses by up to 17x; the SAT-solver decisions by up to 79x; the SAT-solver conflicts by up to 96x; and accelerated the SAT solving by up to 420x.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268859","","Acceleration;Business continuity;Decision feedback equalizers;Formal verification;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Microprocessors;Observability;Signal processing;Testing","Boolean functions;formal verification;microprocessor chips","Boolean circuits;CNF;EUFM;ITE operators;ITE outputs;SAT-solver decisions;benchmark formulas;equality with uninterpreted functions and memories;fanout count;formal verification;intermediate variables;microprocessors;output variable;signal unobservability;translation strategy;tree output","","11","2","74","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis- and static timing analysis-based methodology to derive a reduced model that computes the worst case substrate noise in the design. The reduced model contains only passive components, which are very few, and is very quick to simulate. The main feature of our methodology is that, unlike previous approaches, it is independent of input patterns and does not need to simulate for millions of clock cycles. This lets us apply it to a full-chip design in reasonable CPU time. We validate our reduced model on several benchmark circuits against a detailed and highly accurate reference model. On average, the reduced model is within 16.4% of the reference model and is up to 38 times faster. Finally, we apply our methodology to a mixed-signal switch chip design consisting of 8 million gates and show that it finishes in 17 minutes.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268912","","Central Processing Unit;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Computational modeling;Independent component analysis;Noise reduction;SPICE;Switches;Timing;Tin","circuit complexity;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;sensitivity analysis;system-on-chip","SN;SPICE model;clock cycles;deep sub-micron system-on-chip design;design complexity;full-chip substrate noise analysis;mixed-signal designs;mixed-signal switch chip design;passive components;sensitivity analysis;sensitivity-based modeling;static timing analysis;switching noise","","5","1","14","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose to reduce the static energy dissipation of an on-chip data cache by taking advantage of the frequent values (FV) that widely exist in a data cache memory. The original FV-based low-power cache design aimed at only reducing dynamic power, at the cost of a 5% slowdown. We propose a better design that reduces both static and dynamic cache power, and that uses a circuit design that eliminates performance overhead. A designer can utilize our architecture by simulating an application and then synthesizing the FVs into an application-specific cache design when values will not change, or by simulating and then writing to an FV-cache with configuration registers when values could change. Furthermore, we describe hardware that can dynamically determine FVs and write to the configuration registers completely transparently.

Eventually, those models are linked to a standard systemC simulator, running at BCA and TLM abstraction level. To make the system power simulation fast and effective, we enhanced the STBus class library with a new set of power profiling features (""Power API""), allowing to perform power analysis either statically (i.e.: total avg. power) or at simulation runtime (i.e.: dynamic profiling). In addition to random patterns, our methodology has been extensively benchmarked with the high-level systemC simulation of a real world multi-processor platform (MP-ARM). It consists of four ARM7TDMI processors accessing a number of peripheral targets (including several banks of SRAMs, Interrupt's slaves and ROMs) through the STBus communication infrastructure. A remarkable amount of SW layers are executed on top of MP-ARM platform, including a distributed real-time operating system (RTEMS) and a set of multi-tasking DSP applications.

Our approach is based on importing and adapting the time-varying pade (TVP) method, for linear time-varying (LTV) model reduction, from the mixed-signal macromodelling domain. Our approach features naturally higher accuracy than previous ones, and in addition, offers the user a tradeoff between accuracy and macromodel complexity.

Their approach overcomes the problem of long latencies of global interconnects in deep-submicron technologies, while still maintaining much of the inherent simplicity of synchronous design. In particular, wires whose latency is greater than a clock cycle are segmented using ""relay stations"", and IP blocks are made robust to arbitrary communication delays. This paper shows, however, that significant extensions are needed to make latency-insensitive systems useful for the practical design of large-scale SoC's. In particular, this paper proposes three extensions. The first extension allows each synchronous module to treat its input and output channels in a much more flexible manner, i.e., with greater decoupling. The second extension generalizes inter-module communication from point-to-point channels to more complex networks of arbitrary topologies. Finally, the third extension is to target multi-clock SoC's. The net impact of our extensions is the potential for improved throughput, reduced power consumption, and greater flexibility in design.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269025","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269025","","Clocks;Complex networks;Delay;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Relays;Robustness;System-on-a-chip;Throughput;Wires","clocks;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;network topology;system-on-chip;telecommunication channels","arbitrary communication delays;clock cycle;deep submicron technologies;generalized latency insensitive systems;intellectual property;intermodule communication;large scale SOC;multiclock SOC design;multiclock architecture;network topology;point to point channels;power consumption;relay station;single clock SOC design;single clock architecture;synchronous module;system-on-chip","","20","","13","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge is that even though this reduction in power density reduces heat dissipation and can be used to regulate temperature and reduce the need for expensive thermal packages, reducing power density may come at a cost in execution speed. This paper shows the importance of processor-architecture techniques for DTM, and proposes a new, ""hybrid,"" low-overhead implementation based on combining fetch gating and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). When thermal stress is low, fetch gating is superior because it exploits instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Once thermal stress becomes severe enough that fetch gating degrades ILP, DVS is engaged instead to take advantage of its greater ability to reduce power density. We show that under a variety of assumptions about DVS implementation, a hybrid policy reduces DTM performance overhead by 25% on average compared to DVS, and is easy to design.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268820","","Cooling;Costs;Energy management;Environmental management;Packaging;Temperature;Thermal management;Thermal stresses;Trigeneration;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;thermal management (packaging)","DTM;DVS;ILP;dynamic voltage scaling;fetch gating;heat dissipation;hybrid architectural dynamic thermal management;instruction-level parallelism;operating temperatures;power density;processor-architecture techniques;thermal stress","","25","3","20","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, we propose a crosstalk aware interconnect that uses a faster clock and dynamically controls the number of cycles required for transmission based on the estimated delay of the data pattern to be transmitted. In order to accomplish this, we designed a crosstalk analyzer circuit that is incorporated into the sender side of the bus and support a variable cycle transmission mechanism. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme focusing on the on-chip buses of a microprocessor and by using the SPEC2000 benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improves performance by 31.5% as compared to the original pessimistic approach.

The bottom layer of our hierarchical architecture is a set of stationary optimal DPM policies, pre-calculated off-line for selected modes from policy optimization in Markov decision processes. The supervisory power manager at the top layer adaptively and optimally switches among these stationary policies on-line to accommodate the actual mode-switching arrival dynamics.

In particular, memory energy consumption of array-intensive applications can be overwhelming due to poor cache locality. One option for reducing memory energy is to adopt a banked memory architecture, where memory space is divided into banks and each bank can be powered down if it is not in active use. An important issue here is the bank access pattern, which determines opportunities for saving energy. In this paper, we present a compiler-based data layout transformation strategy for increasing the effectiveness of a banked memory architecture. The idea is to transform the array layouts in memory in such a way that two loop iterations executed one after another access the data in the same bank as much as possible; the remaining banks can be placed into a low-power mode.

The proposed DVFS technique relies on dynamically-constructed regression models that allow the CPU to calculate the expected workload and slack time for the next time slot, and thus, adjust its voltage and frequency in order to save energy while meeting soft timing constraints. This is in turn achieved by estimating and exploiting the ratio of the total off-chip access time to the total on-chip computation time. The proposed technique has been implemented on an XScale-based embedded system platform and actual energy savings have been calculated by current measurements in hardware. For memory-bound programs, a CPU energy saving of more than 70% with a performance degradation of 12% was achieved.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","962","967 Vol.2","A distributed sensor network (DSN) designed to cover a given region R, is said to be alive if there is at least one subset of sensors that can collectively cover (sense) the region R. When no such subset exists, the network is said to be dead. A key challenge in the design of a DSN is to maximize the operational life of the network. Since sensors are typically powered by batteries, this requires maximizing the battery lifetime. One way to achieve this is to determine the optimal schedule for transitioning sets of sensors between active and inactive states while satisfying user specified performance constraints. This requires identification of feasible subsets (covers) of sensors and a scheme for switching between such subsets. We present an algorithmic solution to compute all the sensor covers in an implicit manner by formulating the problem as unate covering problem (UCP). The representation of all possible sensor sets is extremely efficient and can accommodate very large number of sensor covers. The representation and formulation makes it possible to consider the residual battery charge when switching between covers. We develop algorithms for switching between sensor covers aimed at maximizing the lifetime of the network. The algorithms take into account the transmission/reception costs of sensors, a user specified quality constraint and also utilize a novel battery model that accounts for the rate-dependent capacity effect and charge recovery during idle periods. Our simulation results show that lifetime improvement can be achieved by exploiting the charge recovery process. The work presented here constitutes a framework for battery aware sensor management in which various types of constraints can be incorporated and a range of other communication protocols can be examined.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269017","","Battery management systems;Capacitive sensors;Costs;Data processing;Low power electronics;Maintenance;Optimal scheduling;Permission;Protocols;Telecommunication network reliability","cells (electric);distributed sensors;energy management systems;reliability","battery aware sensor management;battery lifetime;charge recovery process;communication protocols;distributed sensor network design;quality constraint;rate dependent capacity effect;residual battery charge;sensor covers;sensors subset;transmission/reception costs;unate covering problem","","12","","16","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","778","783 Vol.2","In modern VLSI processes, the cross-coupling capacitance between adjacent neighboring wires on the same metal layer is a very large fraction of the total wire capacitance. This leads to problems of delay variation due to crosstalk and reduced noise immunity, arguably one of the biggest obstacles in the design ICs in recent times. This problem is particularly severe in long on-chip buses, since bus signals are routed at minimum pitch for long distances. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by the use of crosstalk canceling CODECs. We only utilize memoryless CODECs, to reduce the logical complexity and enhance the robustness of our techniques. Bus data patterns can be classified (as 4·C, 3·C, 2·C, 1·C or 0·C patterns) based on the maximum amount of crosstalk that they can exhibit. Crosstalk avoidance CODECs which eliminate 4·C and 3·C patterns have been reported. In this paper, we describe crosstalk avoidance techniques which eliminate 2·C and 1·C patterns. We describe an analytical methodology to accurately characterize the bus area overhead 2·C pattern CODECs. Using these results, we characterize the area overhead versus crosstalk immunity achieved. A similar exercise is performed for 1·C patterns. Our experimental results show that by using 2·C crosstalk canceling techniques, buses can be sped up by up to a factor of 6 with an area overhead of about 200%, and that 1·C techniques are not very robust.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268974","","Capacitance;Codecs;Crosstalk;Delay;Noise cancellation;Noise reduction;Pattern analysis;Robustness;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;capacitance;codecs;crosstalk;delays;memoryless systems;system buses","IC design;VLSI process;bus signals;cross coupling capacitance;crosstalk avoidance techniques;crosstalk canceling CODEC;crosstalk immunity;memoryless CODEC;metal layer;noise immunity;on-chip buses;very large scale integration process;wire capacitance","","26","","14","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the cache accesses usually contribute significantly to the total power consumption of the chip. Based on the observation that an overwhelming majority of the cache access bits are '0', in this paper we propose a value-conscious (VC) cache to reduce the average cache power consumption during an access. Unlike the conventional cache with differential-bitline implementation, the VC cache is a single-bitline design. Depending on the access bit value, the VC cache can dynamically prevent the bitline from being discharged such that the power dissipated in accessing '0' is much less than the power dissipated in accessing '1'. The implementation of the VC cache is a circuit-level technique, which is software independent and orthogonal to other low power techniques at architecture-level. The experimental results based on the SPEC2000 and MediaBench traces show that without compromise of both performance and stability, by exploiting the prevalence of '0' bits in access data the VC cache can reduce the average cache read and write power by about 18%∼22% and 36%∼40%, respectively.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268821","","Batteries;Bridge circuits;Capacitance;Circuit stability;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Pressing;Random access memory;Virtual colonoscopy;Writing","cache storage;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics;memory architecture;microprocessor chips","MediaBench;SPEC2000;VC;access bit value;access data;architecture-level;average cache power consumption;cache access power reduction;circuit-level technique;low power techniques;single-bitline design;software independent;value-conscious cache","","1","10","11","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the spectral peaks in the ground bounce spectrum, we combine the two techniques: (1) phase modulation of the clock; and (2) introducing intended clock skews to spread the switching activities. Experimental results show around 16 dB reductions in the spectral peaks of the noise spectrum when these two techniques are combined.

The scheme requires only one bias voltage distribution network, but allows for back biasing adjustments to more effectively mitigate die-to-die and within-die process variations. The biasing setting for each well is determined using a modified genetic algorithm.

This substitution was made with main focus in the carry lookahead, hierarchical carry lookahead and carry select architectures, with the objective to increase the JPEG compressor performance. As the compressor architecture was designed in an hierarchical mode the operators substitution was an activity quite simple, because it has not involved the other hierarchy levels. The operators were described in VHDL, synthesized and validated. They were inserted in the 2-D DCT architecture for synthesis in the whole module. The 2-D DCT was synthesized for an altera FPGA. With this project space exploration, the highest performance obtained for the 2-D DCT was 23% higher than the original, using 11% more logic cells.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269234","","Discrete cosine transforms;Field programmable gate arrays;Filters;Focusing;Frequency domain analysis;Image coding;Logic;Pipelines;Space exploration;Transform coding","carry logic;data compression;discrete cosine transforms;hardware description languages;image coding;logic circuits","2D DCT architecture;JPEG compressor;VHDL;carry logic;discrete cosine transform;hardware description language;joint photographic experts group;project space exploration","","0","","12","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result the errors coming from opamp offset and finite open-loop dc gain, switch charge injection and clock feedthrough, parasitic capacitors, and intrinsic noise sources are reduced under the LSB level. To process a multiplexed (8 channels) single-ended analogue input, an efficient single-ended to fully differential circuit has been presented.

The relative importance of soft tasks and how the quality of results is affected when missing a soft deadline are captured by utility functions associated to soft tasks. Thus the aim is to find the execution order of tasks that makes the total utility maximum and guarantees hard deadlines. We consider time intervals rather than fixed execution times for tasks. Since a purely off-line solution is too pessimistic and a purely on-line approach incurs an unacceptable overhead due to the high complexity of the problem, we propose a quasi-static approach where a number of schedules are prepared at design-time and the decision of which of them to follow is taken at run-time based on the actual execution times.

Proceedings","20040308","2004","2","","944","947 Vol.2","This paper addresses the well known difficulty of applying model order reduction (MOR) to linear circuits with a large number of input-output terminals. Traditional MOR techniques substitute the original large but sparse matrices used in the mathematical modeling of linear circuits by models that approximate the behavior of the circuit at its terminals, and use significantly smaller matrices. Unfortunately these small MOR matrices become dense as the number of terminals increases, thus canceling the benefits of size reduction. The paper introduces a model reduction technique suitable for circuits with numerous terminals. The technique exploits the correlation that almost always exists between circuit responses at different terminals. The correlation is rendered explicit through an SVD-based algorithm and the result is a substantial sparsification of the MOR matrices. The proposed sparsification technique is applicable to a large class of problems encountered in the analysis and design of interconnect in VLSI circuits. Relevant examples are used to analyze and validate the method.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269013","","Degradation;Information analysis;Integrated circuit interconnections;Linear circuits;Linear systems;Mathematical model;Reduced order systems;Sparse matrices;Transfer functions;Wires","linear systems;reduced order systems;singular value decomposition;sparse matrices","SVD based algorithm;VLSI circuits;circuit responses;input-output terminals;linear circuits;linear systems;mathematical modeling;model order reduction techniques;singular value decomposition;sparse matrices;sparsification technique;very large scale integration circuits","","19","","5","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on the performance of the general purpose processors used for executing high level protocol processing, since this part proves to be the bottleneck of the design. The performance is analyzed by executing a set of widely used, real applications and by applying network traffic according to certain stochastic criteria. The performance of the RISC used is compared with that of other well-known CPU architectures so as to verify that our results are applicable to the general network processors era. As our results demonstrate, the bottleneck of the majority of the network processors is the general-purpose processing units used, since today's network protocols need a great amount of high-level processing.

An important issue is the granularity of the basic processing elements of the datapath, in view of the combination of programmable function by hardware control-the classical datapath paradigm-and the dynamic reconfiguration. DRIP can perform a large set of digital image processing algorithms with real-time performance to fulfill the requirements of contemporary complex applications.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269237","","Application software;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Hardware;Image processing;Informatics;Mathematics;Pixel;Reconfigurable architectures;Runtime","data flow computing;functional programming;image processing;reconfigurable architectures","classical datapath paradigm;digital image processing algorithms;dynamically reconfigurable image processor;hardware control;real time performance;run time reconfigurable datapath architecture","","1","","16","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose network topology traversal strategies that first schedule PEs that are spatially close and that have more interconnections among them. We use an interconnect aware list scheduling heuristic as a vehicle to perform the network topology exploration experiments on a set of designs derived from DSP applications. Our experimental results show that a spiral traversal strategy, coupled with a two neighbor interconnect topology leads to good performance for the DSP benchmarks considered. Our prototype framework thus provides an exploration environment for system architects to explore and tune coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures for particular application domains.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268891","","Computer science;Delay effects;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Microprocessors;Network topology;Parallel processing;Reconfigurable architectures;Routing;Scheduling","application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network topology;processor scheduling;reconfigurable architectures;signal processing","ASIC;DSP benchmarks;FPGA;application specific integrated circuits;arithmetic logic units;coarse-grain reconfigurable architectures;communication delays;digital signal processing;field programmable gate arrays;mesh-based reconfigurable architectures;mesh-like network;microprocessors;network topology;processing element interconnection;processing element scheduling;processing elements;reconfigurable fabrics;spiral traversal strategy","","14","","18","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Naturally-occurring instances of such problems are often small and can be solved optimally. A recent wave of improvements in algorithms for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and 0-1 ILP suggests generic problem-reduction methods, rather than problem-specific heuristics, because: (1) heuristics are easily upset by new constraints; (2) heuristics tend to ignore structure; and (3) many relevant problems are provably inapproximable. The NP-spec project offers a language to specify NP-problems and automatic reductions to SAT. Problem reductions often lead to highly symmetric SAT instances, and symmetries are known to slow down SAT solvers. In this work, we compare several avenues for symmetry-breaking, in particular when certain kinds of symmetry are present in all generated instances. Our surprising conclusion is that instance-independent symmetries should often be processed together with instance-specific symmetries rather than earlier, at the specification level.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268868","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268868","","Acceleration;Constraint optimization;High level synthesis;Integer linear programming;Problem-solving;Registers","Boolean algebra;computability;graph colouring;high level synthesis;integer programming;symmetry","0-1 ILP;Boolean satisfiability;NP-problems;NP-spec project;code optimization;graph coloring;high level synthesis;instance-independent symmetries;integer linear programming;problem-reduction methods;problem-specific heuristics;register allocation;symmetry-breaking","","2","","17","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important problem in many sensor network applications is to decide the amount of computation (or filtering) that needs to be done in the sensor nodes before the data are shifted to a central base station. Right amount of data filtering in the sensor nodes can lead to large savings in network-wide energy consumption. The main goal of this paper is to develop an automated strategy for data filtering in wireless sensor nodes. Assuming that one needs to reduce the overall energy consumption (as opposed to reducing just computation energy or communication energy), the proposed strategy attempts to strike a balance between computation energy consumption and communication energy consumption. Our experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed data filtering strategy generates substantial energy savings in practice.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268992","","Application software;Base stations;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Filtering;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Power engineering and energy;Wireless sensor networks","filtering theory;power consumption;wireless sensor networks","central base station;communication energy;computation energy;energy consumption reduction;energy savings;sensor nodes;tuning insensor data filtering;wireless sensor network","","6","","20","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in wireless mobile devices like palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDA), storage memory is limited or absent due to weight, size and power constraints. As a consequence, swapping over remote memory devices can be considered as a viable alternative. Nevertheless, power hungry wireless network interface cards (WNIC) may limit the battery lifetime and application performance if not efficiently exploited. In this work we explore performance and energy of network swapping in comparison with swapping on local micro-drives and flash memories. Our study points out that remote swapping over power-manageable WNICs can be more efficient than local swapping and that both energy and performance can be optimized through power-aware reshaping of data requests.

In this paper we present a code generator which performs a graph based code selection and a complete phase coupling of code selection, instruction scheduling (including compaction) and register allocation. In addition, our code generator takes into account effects of the subsequent address code generation phase. In order to solve the phase coupling problem and to handle the problem complexity, our code generator is based on a genetic algorithm. Experimental results for several benchmarks and an MP3 application for two DSPs show the effectiveness and the retargetability of our approach.

In third-generation (3G) wireless systems channel coding techniques must serve both voice and data users whose requirements considerably vary. Thus the third generation partnership project (3GPP) standard offers two coding techniques, convolutional-coding for voice and turbo-coding for data services. In this paper we present a combined channel decoding architecture for 3G terminal applications. It outperforms a solution based on two separate decoders due to an efficient reuse of computational hardware and memory resources for both decoders. Moreover it supports blind transport format detection.

The formulation captures complex situations like triggering of traditional false paths and simultaneous switching in a unified symbolic representation in addition to identifying false paths, critical paths as well as conditions for such situations. This information is then represented as an event-time graph. A simple temporal logic on events is proposed that can be used to formulate a wide class of useful queries for various input scenarios.

The integration of the SDF model with the UML state machine model is also discussed.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268954","","Application software;Code standards;Context modeling;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Object oriented modeling;Software standards;Software systems;Unified modeling language","data flow graphs;embedded systems;finite state machines;object-oriented methods;specification languages","UML;embedded system behavior;object-oriented context;state machine model;stream processing;synchronous dataflow model;system description language","","3","","7","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is fully adaptive and generates coding table on-the-fly during compression and decompression. When encountering a branch target, the coding table is cleared to ensure correctness. Decompression requires only a simple lookup and update when necessary. Our method provides 8 bytes peak decompression bandwidth and 1.82 bytes in average.

For a relatively strong nonlinear system, this method will mostly lose efficiency because of the exponentially increased number of inputs in higher order variational equations caused by the individual reduction process of the variational systems. Moreover, the inexact inputs into the higher order variational equations indispensably introduce extra errors in the order reduction process. Inspired by the variational analysis, we propose a direct model order reduction method. The order of the approximate polynomial system of the original nonlinear system is directly reduced by one project space. The proposed direct reduction technique can easily avoid the errors brought by inexact inputs and the exponentially increased inputs.

We had proposed two techniques previously - (a) a stream-based estimator that counts crosstalk events on a bus; and (b) a statistical enumeration technique that enumerates crosstalk-producing values on a bus and computes their occurrence probability. Both these techniques suffer from exponential time complexity with respect to the bus-width. In this work, we propose a statistical non-enumerative technique that has linear time complexity with respect to the bus-width. We achieve the linear complexity by resorting to: (1) manipulating the data stream to make the crosstalk-producing values contiguous and (2) sampling the distribution function and storing it as a lookup table. Experimental results for data streams from different data environments are presented, compared against the stream-based approach. Average errors of less than 12% are obtained for bus-widths ranging from 8b to 32b.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269041","","Capacitance;Crosstalk;Equations;Noise reduction;Probability;Sampling methods;Statistics;System buses;Transient analysis;Wires","computational complexity;correlation theory;crosstalk;estimation theory;probability;sampling methods;system buses;table lookup","bitlevel crosstalk probability;exponential time complexity;intra bus crosstalk;linear time complexity;lookup table;sampling;standard deviation;statistical nonenumerative technique;stream based estimator;system bus;temporal correlation;word level statistical estimator;word level statistics","","2","","18","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within our NoC architecture nostrum, we have implemented a service of guaranteed bandwidth (GB), and latency, in addition to the already existing service of best-effort (BE) packet delivery. The guaranteed bandwidth is accessed via virtual circuits (VC). The VCs are implemented using a combination of two concepts that we call 'Looped Containers' and 'Temporally Disjoint Networks'. The looped containers are used to guarantee access to the network-independently of the current network load without dropping packets; and the TDNs are used in order to achieve several VCs, plus ordinary BE traffic, in the network. The TDNs are a consequence of the deflective routing policy used, and gives rise to an explicit time-division-multiplexing within the network. To prove our concept an HDL implementation has been synthesised and simulated. The cost in terms of additional hardware needed, as well as additional bandwidth is very low-less than 2 percent in both cases! Simulations showed that ordinary BE traffic is practically unaffected by the VCs.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269001","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Containers;Delay;Network-on-a-chip;Quality of service;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Virtual colonoscopy","hardware description languages;high level synthesis;network routing;packet switching;quality of service;system-on-chip;time division multiplexing","HDL implementation;VC;best effort traffic;deflective routing policy;guaranteed bandwidth;hardware description languages;high level synthesis;looped containers;network on-chip architecture;nostrum network on-chip;quality of service;temporally disjoint networks;time division multiplexing;virtual circuits","","105","","17","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the signal integrity features were introduced to primetime there was also a feature added that was hardly announced: primetime can write out timing paths for simulation with spice that can be used to validate the timing numbers calculated by primetime. By comparing the numbers calculated by primetime to a simulation with spice for selected paths the designers can verify the timing and build up confidence or identify errors. This paper will describe a validation flow for primetime timing reports that is based on extraction of the spice paths, starting the spice simulation, parsing the simulation results, and creating a report comparing primetime and spice timing. All these steps are done inside the TCL environment of primetime.

"Efficient mixed-domain behavioural modelling of ferromagnetic hysteresis implemented in VHDL-AMS","Wilson, P.R.; Ross, J.N.; Brown, A.D.; Kazmierski, T.; Baranowski, J.","Southampton Univ., UK","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 2004. Proceedings","20040308","2004","1","","742","743 Vol.1","In this paper, a modified model of ferromagnetic hysteresis suitable for mixed-signal simulations in VHDL-AMS is presented. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how a numerically stable and accurate implementation of the Jiles-Atherton model can be achieved using a 4th order Runga-Kutta integration of the derivative of magnetization with respect to the field strength (H). While most SPICE-like implementations require inconvenient integration in time to obtain the magnetization derivative, our approach is more general as it does not rely on the underlying differential equation solver for this purpose. The model addresses the non-physical situation of negative BH slopes and proposes an alternative implementation of the anhysteretic function using a polynomial approximation of the Langevin function for low signal levels and a new function with no discontinuities. Model efficiency is improved by monitoring the change in H and only activating the integration function when H changes by a specified amount.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268957","","Circuit simulation;Convergence;Differential equations;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetic materials;Magnetic variables control;Monitoring;Optimization methods;Polynomials;Saturation magnetization","Runge-Kutta methods;circuit simulation;ferromagnetic materials;hardware description languages;magnetic hysteresis;magnetisation;polynomial approximation","4th order Runga-Kutta integration;Jiles-Atherton model;Langevin function;SPICE;VHDL-AMS;anhysteretic function;differential equation solver;ferromagnetic hysteresis;field strength;integration function;magnetization derivative;mixed-domain behavioural modelling;mixed-signal simulations;negative BH slopes;polynomial approximation","","4","","9","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed technique aims at conserving power by reducing the backlight illumination while retaining the image fidelity through preservation of the image contrast. First, we explain how CCFL works and show how to model the non-linearity between its backlight illumination and power consumption. Next, we propose the contrast distortion metric to quantify the image quality loss after backlight scaling. Finally, we formulate and optimally solve the CBCS optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the fidelity and power metrics. Experimental results show that an average of 3.7X power saving can be achieved with only 10% of contrast distortion.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268857","","Brightness;Cathodes;Energy consumption;Fluorescent lamps;Image quality;Lighting;Liquid crystal displays;Photometry;Propagation losses;Videoconference","brightness;fluorescent lamps;lighting control;liquid crystal displays;thin film transistors","CBCS technique;CCFL;backlight illumination;backlight scaling;backlit TFT-LCD display;cold cathode fluorescent lamp;concurrent brightness;contrast distortion metric;contrast scaling;image contrast;image fidelity;image quality loss;optimization problem;power consumption;power minimization","","14","2","16","","","16-20 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, we suggest a method which can calculate the reduced Jacobian matrix directly in the each Newton-Raphson iteration. Since this technique does not need to calculate the original size of Jacobian matrix, the calculation cost is reduced drastically. Therefore, efficient circuit simulation can be achieved.

It involves an erroneous write operation when the same write driver performs two successive write operations with opposite data values. In the first part of the paper, we present the SWDF electrical phenomena and their consequences on the SRAM functioning. Next, we show how SWDFs can be sensitized and observed and how a standard March test is able to detect this type of fault","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211852","","Circuit faults;Decoding;Driver circuits;Electrical fault detection;Performance evaluation;Random access memory;Robots;System-on-a-chip;Testing;Uniform resource locators","SRAM chips;driver circuits","SRAM technology;resistive-open defects;slow write driver faults","","12","","10","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, application-specific instruction set processors (ASIP) are more and more replacing off-the-shelf processors in such systems-on-chip (SoC). Along with the processor cores, heterogeneous memory architectures play an important role as part of the system. According to last year's ITRS, in 2004 about 70 percent of the chip area will be made up of memories. As such architectures are highly optimized for a particular application domain, processor core and memory subsystem design cannot be apart, but have to merge into an efficient design process. In this paper, we present a unified approach for processor/memory co-exploration using an architecture description language. We show an efficient way, of considering instruction set and memory architecture during the entire exploration process. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of our approach with a real-world case study.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253730","","Application specific processors;Architecture description languages;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware design languages;Instruction sets;Memory architecture;Microarchitecture;Process design;Signal processing","circuit CAD;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip","ASIP;SoC;application-specific instruction set processors;architecture description language;embedded systems;heterogeneous memory architectures;multiple abstraction levels;processor/memory co-exploration;systems-on-chip","","5","","19","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is necessary to not just provide smooth approximations but also to provide error analysis and convergence properties of these approximations. We present a new approximation scheme which uses a non-recursive approximation to the max function. We also show the convergence properties and the error bounds. The accuracy of our proposed scheme is better than those of the popular Logarithm-Sum-Exponential (LSE) wirelength model [7] and the recently proposed Weighted Average(WA) wirelength model[3]. We also experimentally validate the comparison by using global and detail placements produced by NTU Placer [1] on ISPD 2004 benchmark suite. The experimentations on benchmarks validate that the error bounds of our model are lower, with an average of 4% error in the total wirelength.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513791","","Analytical models;Approximation methods;Benchmark testing;Convergence;Numerical models;Runtime;Upper bound","","","","1","","7","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
