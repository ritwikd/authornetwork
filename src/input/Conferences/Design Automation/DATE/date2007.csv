The proposed models are implemented in a three-order ΣΔ fractional-N PLL based frequency synthesizer with a 60MHz frequency tuning range. Cadence SpectreVerilog simulation results show that behavioral modeling can provide a great speed-up over circuit-level simulation. Synchronously, the phase noise, spurs and settling time can also be accurately predicted, so it is helpful to a grasp of the fundamentals at the early stage of the design and optimization design at the system level.

In reality the difference between a successful design and a failure resides today more then ever in the ability of the design team to properly master all the critical design factors at once. In essence, today's system on chip design represent a multidiscipline challenge that spans from architecture through design to test and finally mass production. SoC design for portable applications has to cope with very unique constraints that normally greatly challenge the ability of an organization and most of the times of an entire company to fully master its industrialization capabilities and pushes concurrent design to new limits. In the end, only a well thought out Architecture followed by best practices design techniques with a high level of understanding of the manufacturing constraints and excellent logistics can result in a device that can be produced in the volume required by the cell phone industry today. This paper will try to capture how these challenges have been addressed to design the family of Application Processing Engines named Nomadiktrade. The paper will specifically focus on the third generation device labeled STn8815S22 where the integration capabilities of silicon technology have been pared with those of System in Package design to provide and extremely compact and effective System on Chip for portable multimedia applications. An overview of the main success factors and challenges will be presented driving the reader from the Architecture conception through the chip industrialization.

The core testing schedule with compression enabled is decided using a generalized strip packing algorithm. The hardware architecture to implement the proposed scheme is very simple.

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","For design-for-test (DFT) purposes, analogue and mixed-signal testing has to cope with the difficulty of test evaluation before production. This paper aims at evaluating test measures for RF components in order to optimize production test sets and thus reduce test cost. For this, we have first developed a statistical model of the performances and possible test measures of the circuit under test (a low noise amplifier). The statistical multi-normal model is derived from data obtained using Monte-Carlo circuit simulation (five hundred iterations). This statistical model is then used to generate a larger circuit population (one million instances) from which test metrics can be estimated with ppm precision at the design stage, considering just process deviations. With the use of this model, a trade-off between defect level and yield loss resulting from process deviations is used to set test limits. After fixing test limits, we have carried out a fault simulation campaign to verify the suitability of the different test measurements, targeting both catastrophic and single parametric faults. Catastrophic faults are modelled by shorts and opens. A parametric fault is defined as the minimum value of a physical parameter that causes a specification to be violated. Test metrics are then evaluated for the LNA case-study. As a result, test metrics for functional measurements such as S-parameters and noise figure are compared with low cost test measurements such as RMS and peak-to-peak current consumption and output voltage, input/output impedance, and the correlation between current consumption and output voltage","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211887","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Cost function;Current measurement;Design for testability;Impedance measurement;Noise measurement;Production;Radio frequency;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;analogue integrated circuits;design for testability;fault simulation;low noise amplifiers;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;production testing","Monte-Carlo circuit simulation;RF components;analogue testing;catastrophic faults;circuit under test;design-for-test;fault simulation campaign;low noise amplifier production testing;mixed-signal testing;multinomial statistical model;parametric faults","","2","","10","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, prior to production, a significant amount of time and effort is needed to bring-up and validate various aspects of the silicon design in the system. In particular, the use of multi-Gigabit I/O signaling for a high I/O count, high-volume product introduces unique test challenges during these two phases of the product life cycle. In this paper, we shall discuss the test infrastructure and methodologies used to accelerate bring-up and in-system silicon characterization for high-speed mixed-signal I/O.

We propose a model based test generation framework that generates tests for design fault classes inspired from software validation. There are two main contributions in this paper. Firstly, we propose a microprocessor modeling and test generation framework that generates test suites to satisfy modified condition decision coverage (MCDC), a structural coverage metric that detects most of the classified design faults as well as the remaining faults not covered by MCDC. Secondly, we show that there exists good correlation between types of design faults proposed by software validation and the errors/bugs reported in case studies on microprocessor validation. We demonstrate the framework by modeling and generating tests for the microarchitecture of VESPA, a 32-bit microprocessor.

On the other hand the chosen system design approach has to ensure that a system design project rapidly advances through all stages of refinement from an algorithmic model to a real ""system on chip"" (SoC) while maintaining backwards equivalence of the produced HW and FW/SW code with the original algorithmic model. This system design challenge also demands a new interdisciplinary team approach encompassing all design skills ranging from concept to HW and FW/SW engineering as well as system verification to increase the overlap in the system concept, implementation and verification phase. But how do these interdisciplinary teams cooperate efficiently, as they are used to metaphorically ""speak different design languages""? Resulting in an industry record development time for a 3.5G UMTS modem the employment of a novel system design approach is shown which serves as common system design language, avoiding the babylonian language disaster of isolated engineering worlds. The motivation for an increasing overlap of system concept, implementation and verification phases is obvious: it can save time (to market) in the magnitude of several months or even more and thus drastically shorten design cycles by parallel development of HW and FW/SW. The proposed approach also helps to avoid costly redesign cycles due to conceptual errors and optimizes the quality of the developed system HW and FW/SW thereby also substantially reducing system development R&D costs","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211904","","3G mobile communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Design engineering;Maintenance engineering;Modems;Natural languages;Refining;System-on-a-chip;Virtual prototyping;Wireless communication","microprocessor chips;software prototyping","increasing system complexity;industrial designs;interdisciplinary system;system on chip;virtual prototyping;wireless communications","","2","","1","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method, when combined with hierarchical test pattern generation for embedded modules, guarantees 100% delay test coverage for detectable faults in modules. A study on the delay testability problem in behavior level shows that low delay fault coverage is usually attributed to the fact that two-pattern test for delay testing cannot be delivered to modules under test in consecutive cycles. To solve the problem, the paper proposed an HUTS method that ensures valid test pairs can be sent to each module through synthesized circuit hierarchy. Experimental results show that this method achieves 100% fault coverage for transition faults in functional units, while the fault coverage in circuits synthesized by LEA-based allocation algorithm is rather poor.

Therefore, to create a reliable system-on-a-chip device requires designers to implement fault tolerance. However, while system-level fault tolerance could significantly relax the quality requirements of the system's building blocks, every fault-tolerant scheme only works under certain failure mechanisms and within a certain range of error probabilities. Also, designing a system with a high failure-rate component could be very expensive because the growth rate of the design complexity and the system overhead for fault tolerance could be significantly greater than the component failure rate. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the trade-offs between component test quality and system fault-tolerant capability for achieving the desired reliability under cost constraints. In this paper, the authors propose an analysis framework for system reliability considering (a) the test quality achieved by manufacturing testing, on-line self-checking, and off-line built-in self-test; (b) the fault-tolerant and spare schemes; and (c) the component defect and error probabilities. The authors demonstrate that, through proper redundancy configurations and low-cost testing to insure a certain degree of component test quality, a low-redundant system might achieve equal or higher reliability than a high-redundant system","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212037","","Automatic testing;Costs;Error probability;Failure analysis;Fault tolerant systems;Nanoscale devices;Pulp manufacturing;Reliability;System testing;System-on-a-chip","built-in self test;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;nanotechnology;system-on-chip","built-in self-test;component test quality;error tolerance;failure rate;fault tolerance;manufacturing testing;nanometer devices;on-line self-checking;system overhead;system reliability analysis;system-on-chip","","6","","14","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate that avoiding such input cubes leads to the detection of target faults after the application of limited numbers of random input vectors. This indicates that explicit test generation is not necessary once certain input values are precluded.

At any clock cycle, one or more cores can simultaneously receive data from the LFSR. Seeds for the LFSR are computed from the core bits from the test cubes for multiple cores. We also propose a scan-slice-based scheduling algorithm that tries to maximize the number of core bits the LFSR can produce at each clock cycle, such that the overall test application time is minimized. Experimental results for both ISCAS circuits and industrial circuits show that optimal test application time, which is determined by the largest core, can be achieved. The proposed approach has small hardware overhead and is easy to deploy. Only one LFSR, one phase shifter, and a few counters should be added to the SoC. The scheduling algorithm is also scalable for large industrial circuits. The CPU time for a large industrial design ranges from 1 to 30 minutes","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211796","","Circuit testing;Clocks;Counting circuits;Engines;Hardware;Job shop scheduling;Phase shifters;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Test data compression","circuit optimisation;data compression;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;shift registers;system-on-chip","1 to 30 mins;LFSR reseeding technique;SoC testing;TAM optimization;counters;industrial circuits;linear feedback shift register;on-chip LFSR;phase shifter;scan-slice-based scheduling algorithm;test data compression;test scheduling;test wrapper design","","4","","10","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process of customizing parameter values for a particular application, called tuning, can be a challenging task for a designer. Here we focus on the problem of tuning a parameterized soft-core microprocessor to achieve the best performance on a particular application, subject to size constraints. We map the tuning problem to a well-established statistical paradigm called design of experiments (DoE), which involves the design of a carefully selected set of experiments and a sophisticated analysis that has the objective to extract the maximum amount of information about the effects of the input parameters on the experiment. We apply the DoE method to analyze the relation between input parameters and the performance of a soft-core microprocessor for a particular application, using only a small number of synthesis/execution runs. The information gained by the analysis in turn drives a soft-core tuning heuristic. We show that using DoE to sort the parameters in order of impact results in application speedups of 6times-17times versus an un-tuned base soft-core. When compared to a previous single-factor tuning method, the DoE-based method achieves 3times-6times application speedups, while requiring about the same tuning runtime. We also show that tuning runtime can be reduced by 40-45% by using predictive tuning methods already built into a DoE tool","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211902","","Application specific integrated circuits;Circuit optimization;Computer science;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Information analysis;Integrated circuit synthesis;Integrated circuit technology;Microprocessors;Runtime","design of experiments;microprocessor chips","design of experiments;soft core microprocessor;system design;tuning heuristic","","11","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The best performance is obtained from custom designed integrated circuits. In contrast, the maximum flexibility is delivered by a general purpose processor. Among the architecture types emerged over the past years to strike an optimum balance between these two attributes, two are prominent. The first ones are field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based architectures and the second ones are application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs). Depending on the type of application (i.e. stream-like or control-dominated) either one of the above mentioned architecture types is able to deliver high performance or flexibility or both. Consequently, a new design approach with partial re-configurability on the application-specific processor is attracting strong research interest. We call this architecture re-configurable ASIP (rASIP). Currently, the lack of a high-level abstraction of the rASIP limits the designer from trying out various design alternatives because of long and tedious exploration cycles. To address this issue, in this paper, a high-level specification for re-configurable processors is proposed. Furthermore, a seamless design space exploration methodology using this specification is proposed","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211816","","Application specific processors;Architecture description languages;Design methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware design languages;Signal design;Signal processing;Software tools;Space exploration;System-on-a-chip","application specific integrated circuits;embedded systems;high level synthesis;instruction sets;logic design;microprocessor chips;specification languages","application-specific instruction-set processors;design space exploration;high-level specification;partially reconfigurable embedded processors;reconfigurable ASIP","","4","","20","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In most cases one performance can only be optimized at cost of others, therefore a sizing must aim at an optimal trade-off between the important circuit performances. This paper presents a new deterministic method to calculate the complete range of performance trade-offs, the so-called Pareto-optimal front, of a given circuit topology. Known deterministic methods solve a set of constrained multi-objective optimization problems independently of each other. The presented method minimizes a set of goal attainment (GA) optimization problems simultaneously. In a parallel algorithm, the individual GA optimization processes compare and exchange their iterative solutions.

First, we develop a CDC fault model to present the actual effect of metastability. Second, we use a temporal dataflow graph (TDFG) to propagate the CDC faults to observable variables.

Three promising algorithms for the equalization of the propagation channel are compared regarding performance, complexity and power consumption using fixed-point SystemC models.

Advances in this domain require a detailed knowledge of these failure physical properties and the development of appropriated test methods. Several works have shown the relative increase of resistive defects (both opens and shorts), and that they mainly affect circuit timing rather than impacting its static DC behavior. Defect evolution, together with the increase of parameter variations, represents a serious challenge for traditional delay test methods based on fixed time delay limit setting. One alternative to deal with variation relies on adopting correlation where test limits for one parameter are settled based on its correspondence to other circuit variables. In particular, the correlation of circuit delay to reduced V <sub>DD</sub> has been proposed as a useful test method.

"Automatic Test Pattern Generation for Maximal Circuit Noise in Multiple Aggressor Crosstalk Faults","Ganeshpure, K.P.; Kundu, S.","Massachusetts Univ., Amherst, MA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition, 2007. DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Decreasing process geometries and increasing operating frequencies have made VLSI circuits more susceptible to signal integrity related failures. Capacitive crosstalk is one of the causes of such kind of failures. Crosstalk fault results from switching of neighboring lines that are capacitively coupled. Long nets are more susceptible to crosstalk faults because they tend to have a higher coupling capacitance to overall capacitance ratio. A typical long net has multiple aggressors. In generating patterns to create maximal crosstalk noise, it may not be possible to activate all aggressors at the same time. Therefore, pattern generation must focus on activating a maximal subset of aggressors weighted by actual coupling capacitance values. This is a variant of max-satisfiability problem. Unlike a traditional max-satisfiability problem, here we must deal with signal propagation to an observable output. In this paper, the authors present a novel solution that combines 0-1 integer linear program (ILP) with traditional stuck-at fault ATPG. The maximal aggressor activation is formulated as a linear programming problem while the fault effect propagation is treated as an ATPG problem. The problems are separated by min-cut circuit partitioning technique based on Kernighan-Lin-Fiduccia-Mattheyses (KLFM) method. This proposed technique was applied to ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits. Results indicated that 75-100% of the aggressors could be switched for generating crosstalk noise while satisfying requirement of sensitizing a path to the output","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211854","","Automatic test pattern generation;Capacitance;Circuit faults;Circuit noise;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Frequency;Geometry;Signal processing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;automatic test pattern generation;computability;fault diagnosis;integer programming;integrated circuit noise;linear programming","Kernighan-Lin-Fiduccia-Mattheyses method;VLSI;automatic test pattern generation;capacitive crosstalk;crosstalk faults;integer linear programming;max-satisfiability problem;maximal circuit noise;multiple aggressors;signal integrity;stuck-at faults","","8","","24","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a refinement flow that delays as much as possible the separation between HW and SW concurrent entities (threads), allowing their differentiation, but preserving an homogeneous simulation environment. The approach relies on SystemC as the unique reference language. However, SystemC threads, corresponding to the SW application, are simulated outside the control of the SystemC simulation kernel to exploit the typical features of multi-threading real-time operating systems running on embedded systems. On the contrary HW threads maintain the original simulation semantics of SystemC. This allows designers to effectively tune the SW application before HW/SW partitioning, leaving to an automatic procedure the SW generation, thus avoiding error-prone and time-consuming manual conversions","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211780","","Computational modeling;Costs;Delay;Embedded system;Engines;Hardware design languages;Kernel;Operating systems;Real time systems;Yarn","embedded systems;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;operating system kernels","SystemC simulation kernel;SystemC threads;complex co-simulation strategies;embedded systems;hardware-software co-design;hardware-software partitioning;multithreading;real-time operating systems;smooth refinement flow;unique reference language","","6","1","21","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, with glitch power contributing to a significant component of dynamic power, pattern generation needs to be timing-aware to minimize glitching. In this paper, we propose a timing-based, power and layout-aware pattern generation technique that minimizes both global and localized switching activity. Techniques are also proposed for power-profiling and optimizing an initial pattern set to obtain a power-safe pattern set, with the addition of minimal patterns.

In this paper, the authors show a design flow, based on software mapping algorithms, to improve the yield of nanometric programmable logic arrays (PLAs). While further improvements to the manufacturing technology will be needed to make these devices fully usable, our flow can significantly shrink the gap between current and desired yield levels. Also, the approach does not need post-fabrication functional analysis and mapping, therefore dramatically cutting on verification costs.

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Despite the progress of the last decades in electronic design automation, arithmetic circuits have always received way less attention than other classes of digital circuits. Logic synthesisers, which play a fundamental role in design today, play a minor role on most arithmetic circuits, performing some local optimisations but hardly improving the overall structure of arithmetic components. Architectural optimisations have been often studied manually, and only in the case of very common building blocks such as fast adders and multi-input adders, ad-hoc techniques have been developed. A notable case is multi-input addition, which is the core of many circuits such as multipliers, etc. The most common technique to implement multi-input addition is using compressor trees, which are often composed of carry-save adders (based on (3 : 2) counters, i.e., full adders). A large body of literature exists to implement compressor trees using large counters. However, all the large counters were built by using full and half adders recursively. In this paper we give some definite answers to issues related to the use of large counters. We present a general technique to implement large counters whose performance is much better than the ones composed of full and half adders. Also we show that it is not always useful to use larger optimised counters and sometimes a combination of various size counters gives the best performance. Our results show 15% improvement in the critical path delay. In some cases even hardware area is reduced by using our counters","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211837","","Adders;Circuit synthesis;Counting circuits;Design optimization;Digital arithmetic;Digital circuits;Electronic design automation and methodology;Logic circuits;Logic design;Synthesizers","adders;digital arithmetic;integer programming;linear programming;logic design","ad-hoc techniques;architectural optimisations;arithmetic circuits;automatic synthesis;carry-save adders;compressor trees;critical path delay improvement;electronic design automation;large counters;logic synthesis;multiinput addition","","3","","15","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today's verification challenges require powerful testbenches and high-performance simulation solutions such as Hardware Simulation Accelerators and Hardware Emulators that have been in use in hardware and electronic system design centers for approximately the last decade. In particular, in order to accelerate functional simulation, hardware emulation is used so as to offload calculation-intensive tasks from the software simulator. However, the communication overhead between the software simulator and hardware emulator is becoming a new critical bottleneck. We tackle this problem by partitioning the code running on the software simulator into two sections: the testbench HDL (hardware description language) code that communicates directly with the design under test (DUT) and the rest C-like testbench code. The former section is transformed into synthesizable code while the latter runs in a general purpose CPU.

In this paper, we propose a set of techniques that enable the accurate pinpointing of hold time violating scan cells, their modeling and tolerance, paving the way for the generation of valid test data that can be used to test chips with such systematic failures.

The techniques that we propose are non-intrusive, as they utilize only basic scan capabilities, and thus impose no design changes.

As feature sizes decrease to nanometer scale, the impact of process parameter variations in circuit performance becomes extremely relevant. Even though several statistical timing analysis techniques have recently been proposed, as a form of incorporating variability effects in traditional static timing analysis, corner analysis still is the current timing signoff methodology for any industrial design. Since it is impossible to analyze a design for all the process corners, due to the exponential size of the corner space, the design is usually analyzed for a set of carefully chosen corners, that are expected to cover all the worst-case scenarios. However, there is no established systematic methodology for picking the right worst-case corners, and this task usually relies on the experience of design and process engineers, many times leading to over design. This paper proposes an efficient automated methodology for computing the worst-delay process corners of a digital integrated circuit, given a linear parametric characterization of the gate and interconnect delays","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212043","","Circuit analysis computing;Circuit optimization;Delay estimation;Digital integrated circuits;Fabrication;Integrated circuit interconnections;Process design;Statistical distributions;Timing;Upper bound","delays;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;statistical analysis;timing","corner analysis;digital integrated circuit design;gate delays;industrial design;interconnect delays;process parameter variations;statistical timing analysis","","5","","9","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the performance requirement is low, the supply voltage can be dithered and the circuit can enter from superthreshold region to subthreshold region (V<sub>dd</sub> < V<sub>T</sub>). Such ultra dynamic voltage scaling (UDVS), where the supply voltage switches from 1.2V to 200mV (say), enables remarkable decrease in power consumption with ""acceptable"" performance penalty in the non-burst mode of operation. However, subthreshold operation is very sensitive to process variation (PV) due to the reduced noise margin, and may not work properly unless corrective measures are taken. In this paper, the authors model the trip voltage in both subthreshold and superthreshold regions, and analyze the impact of PV in UDVS. They also propose a circuit design technique such that the same logic gate can efficiently operate in both superthreshold and subthreshold regions under PV. The authors do that by modulating the beta-ratio (P-to-N ratio) of the logic gates. By proper beta-ratio modulation, the authors show that the proposed methodologies can lower energy dissipation per cycle by more than an order of magnitude (42times) in non-burst mode with reduced impact to PVs","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212031","","Circuit noise;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Logic circuits;Logic design;Logic gates;Low voltage;Noise reduction;Switches;Voltage control","logic design;threshold logic","200 to 1200 mV;beta-ratio modulation;circuit design;logic gates;noise margin;process variation;subthreshold region;superthreshold region;ultra-dynamic voltage scaling","","1","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, usually the patterns detecting all of the unacceptable faults also detect a large number of acceptable faults, resulting in a degradation in achievable yield improvement. In this paper, the authors first provide a probabilistic analysis of this problem and show that a conventional ATPG procedure cannot adequately address this problem. The authors then present a novel test pattern selection procedure and an output masking technique to deal with this problem. The selection process generates a test set aimed to detect all unacceptable faults but as few acceptable faults as possible. The masking technique then examines the generated test patterns and identifies a list of output lines that can be masked (not observed) during testing so as to further avoid the detection of acceptable faults. Experimental results show that by employing the proposed techniques, only a small number of acceptable faults are still detected.

We discuss performance losses due to the worst-case design, wherein the entire cache operates with the worst-case process variation delay, followed by process variation aware cache designs which work at set-level granularity. We then propose a technique called block rearrangement to minimize performance loss incurred by a process variation aware cache which works at set-level granularity. Using block rearrangement technique, we rearrange the physical locations of cache blocks such that a cache set can have its ""n"" blocks (assuming a n-way set-associative cache) in multiple rows instead of a single row as in the case of a cache with conventional addressing scheme. By distributing blocks of a cache set over multiple sets, we minimize the number of sets being affected by process variation.

Unfortunately, this goal remains today an unfulfilled challenge, as even the most straightforward practical designs are released with latent bugs. Patching techniques can repair some of these escaped bugs, however, they often incur a performance overhead, and most importantly, they can only be deployed after an escaped bug has been exposed at the customer site. In this paper we present a novel approach to guaranteeing correct system operation by deploying a semantic guardian component. The semantic guardian is an additional control logic block which is included in the design, and can switch the microprocessor's mode of operation from its normal, high-performance but error-prone mode, to a secure, formally verified safe mode, guaranteeing that the execution will be functionally correct. We explore several frameworks where a selective use of the safe mode can enhance the overall functional correctness of a processor. Additionally, we observe through experimentation that semantic guardians facilitate the trade-off between the design validation effort and the performance and area cost of the final secure product.

As part of the ongoing re-work modeling language strategies and the world wide introduction of TLM, a detailed analysis of the impact of description languages, abstraction layers and data types on simulation performance is of high importance. For the presented analysis, we considered five designs that have been modeled in VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, and SystemC, using different value representations and coding styles, covering the abstraction levels from functional to behavioral to RTL. This paper presents our evaluation environment and several interesting findings of our analysis. The most important results are as follows: We found that HDL tool/language/abstraction selection of RTL models impacts on the execution speed with a factor of 4.4. We found that Verilog is on average 2times faster than VHDL for RTL models. We found that SystemC results in 10times slower RTL models than HDLs and surprisingly results in 2.6times slower TLM PV models than SystemVerilog.

Therefore, it is practically impossible to use simulation for optimization purposes.

While a core isolation mechanism can provide controllability and observability at the core I/O interface, its implementation may have various implications on area, functional timing, test time and data volume, and at-speed coverage on the core interface. This paper proposed a non-intrusive core isolation technique that is based on the utilization of existing core registers for isolating the core. The authors provide a core register partitioning algorithm that is capable of identifying the core interface registers, and of robustly isolating a core, resulting in a computationally efficient core isolation implementation that is area and performance efficient at the same time. The proposed isolation technique also ensures minimal test time increase and no at-speed coverage loss on the core interface, offering an elegant solution for soft cores, and thus enabling significant SOC test cost reductions","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211767","","Computer interfaces;Controllability;Costs;Fasteners;Observability;Partitioning algorithms;Registers;Robustness;Testing;Timing","input-output programs;integrated circuit testing;isolation technology;system-on-chip","SOC cores;SOC test;core I/O interface;core interface registers;core isolation techniques;core register partitioning algorithm;nonintrusive isolation;soft cores","","3","","7","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, inband-FEC is an attractive option, because it improves channel-performance without requiring an increase of the transmission bandwidth. We have devised and implemented a novel inband FEC method, dubbed FOCUS, for the electronic-mitigation of physical impairments in SDH/SONET optical networks. It is an inherently low-cost approach for both the metro and backbone network regions, scalable to any SDH/SONET rate and capable to significantly increase optical channel performance. This paper analyzes the most sophisticated ones from the plethora of optimizations that were employed to minimize the architectural complexity of FOCUS, falling in: a) Arithmetic operator design, b) Resource sharing and c) Redundant logic elimination. These optimizations were necessary to obtain a prototype, which eventually permitted the first fully successful laboratory evaluation of the FOCUS inband-FEC method","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212036","","Arithmetic;Bandwidth;Design optimization;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Robustness;SONET;Spine;Synchronous digital hierarchy","SONET;forward error correction;optical fibre networks;synchronous digital hierarchy","10 Gbit/s;SDH;SONET;arithmetic operator design;forward error correction;optical channel performance;optical communication channels;redundant logic elimination;resource sharing","","1","","6","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the authors present a novel DCT architecture that allows aggressive voltage scaling by exploiting the fact that not all intermediate computations are equally important in a DCT system to obtain ""good"" image quality with peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) > 30 dB. This observation has led us to propose a DCT architecture where the signal paths that are less contributive to PSNR improvement are designed to be longer than the paths that are more contributive to PSNR improvement It should also be noted that robustness with respect to parameter variations and low power operation typically impose contradictory requirements in terms of architecture design. However, the proposed architecture lends itself to aggressive voltage scaling for low-power dissipation even under process parameter variations. Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors would only appear from the long paths that are less contributive towards PSNR improvement, providing large improvement in power dissipation with small PSNR degradation. Results show that even under large process variation and supply voltage scaling (0.8V), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (62.8%) for the proposed architecture when compared to existing implementations in 70 nm process technology","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211869","","Computer architecture;Degradation;Digital images;Discrete cosine transforms;Image quality;Noise robustness;PSNR;Signal design;Video compression;Voltage","data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;transform coding;video coding","2D discrete cosine transform;70 nm;image compression;image quality;process variation;video compression;voltage scaling","","21","","14","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a novel method for reducing jitter in timing-critical ATE signals. This method uses a real-time averaging approach to combine multiple ATE signals and produces timing references with significantly lower random jitter. For example, we demonstrate a 3times reduction in jitter by combining eight ATE signals (each with sigma=4ps) to produce a low-jitter signal (sigma=1.3ps). The measured jitter reduction is shown to closely match that predicted by theory.

"Fast Memory Footprint Estimation based on Maximal Dependency Vector Calculation","Hu, Q.; Vandecappelle, A.; Kjeldsberg, P.G.; Catthoor, F.; Palkovic, M.","Norwegian Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Trondheim","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition, 2007. DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","In data dominated applications, loop transformations have a huge impact on the lifetime of array data and therefore on memory footprint. Since a locally optimal loop transformation may have a detrimental effect somewhere else, many alternative loop transformations need to be explored. Therefore, estimation of the memory footprint is essential, and this estimation has to be fast. This paper presents a fast array based memory footprint estimation technique based on counting of iteration nodes in an iteration domain constrained by a maximal lifetime. The maximal lifetime is defined by the maximal dependency vector (MDV) of the array for a given execution ordering. We further present for the first time two approaches for calculation of the MDV: a general approach based on an ILP formulation and a novel vertexes approach when iteration domains are approximated by bounding boxes. Experiments on practical test vehicles demonstrate that the estimation based on our vertexes approach is extremely fast, on average two orders of magnitude faster than the compared approaches, while still keeping the accuracy high. This enables system-level data memory footprint exploration of many different alternative transformed program codes, within interactive time limits, and on realistic complex applications","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211826","","Array signal processing;Design optimization;Life estimation;Lifetime estimation;Multidimensional signal processing;Multimedia systems;Production;Real time systems;Testing;Vehicles","iterative methods;logic CAD;memory architecture;program control structures","ILP formulation;alternative transformed program codes;array data;bounding boxes;execution ordering;fast array based memory footprint estimation;loop transformations;maximal dependency vector calculation;system-level data memory footprint exploration;vertexes approach","","1","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hierarchical system optimizer takes multiple topologies for all the building blocks at each hierarchical abstraction level, and generates optimal topology combinations using multi-objective evolutionary optimization techniques. With the presented methodology, system-level performance trade-offs can be generated where each design point contains valuable information on how the systems performances are influenced by different combinations of lower-level building block topologies. The generated system designs can contain all kinds of topology combinations as long as critical inter-block constraints are met. Different topologies can be assigned to building blocks with the same functional behavior, leading to more optimal hybrid designs than typically obtained in manual designs.

RUDY is based on a rectangular uniform wire density per net and accurately models the routing demand of a circuit as determined by the wire distribution after final routing. Unlike published routing demand estimation, RUDY depends neither on a bin structure nor on a certain routing model to estimate the behavior of a router. Therefore RUDY is independent of the router. Our fast and robust force-directed quadratic placer is based on a generic demand-and-supply model and is guided by the routing demand estimation RUDY to optimize placements for routability. This yields a placer which simultaneously reduces the routing demand in congested regions and increases the routing supply there. Therefore our placer fully utilizes the potential to optimize the routability. This results in the best published routed wirelength of the IBMv2 benchmark suite until now. In detail, our approach outperforms mPL, ROOSTER, and APlace by 9%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

Since all the scan cells in these scan chain groups are observed without specifying the corresponding bits in control patterns, fewer specified bits are required and more scan cells are observed. The seed size is further reduced by reducing numbers of specified bits in the densely specified control patterns.

In such systems, the instruction memory hierarchy consumes a large portion of the total energy consumption. A well designed instruction memory hierarchy can greatly decrease the energy consumption and increase performance. The performance of the instruction memory hierarchy is largely determined by the specific application. Different applications achieve better energy-performance with different configurations of the instruction memory hierarchy. Moreover, applications often exhibit different phases during execution, each exacting different demands on the processor and in particular the instruction memory hierarchy. For a given hardware resource budget, an even better energy-performance may be achievable if the memory hierarchy can be reconfigured before each of these phases. This paper proposed a new dynamically reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy to take advantage of these two characteristics so as to achieve significant energy-performance improvement. The proposed instruction memory hierarchy, which is called DRIM, consists of four banks of on-chip instruction buffers. Each of these can be configured to function as a cache or as a scratchpad memory (SPM) according to the needs of an application and its execution phases. The experimental results using six benchmarks from the MediaBench and the MiBench suites show that DRIM can achieve significant energy reduction","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211994","","Cache storage;Computer science;Design engineering;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Mobile handsets;Power engineering and energy;Scanning probe microscopy","cache storage;embedded systems;instruction sets;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;power consumption;reconfigurable architectures","DRIM;MediaBench;MiBench;dynamically reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy;embedded systems;hardware resource budget;low power electronics;on-chip instruction buffers;power consumption;processor;scratchpad memory","","5","","18","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even if the induced defect is not large enough to result in timing violations, these faults may give rise to reliability problems. To detect them, the paper proposes a testing method that is based on the propagation of pulses within the faulty circuit and that exploits the degraded capability of faulty paths to propagate pulses.

Following this line of work, in this paper the authors show how to account for the effects of cache-related preemption delay (CRPD) in the standard schedulability tests for dynamic priority schedulers like EDF. Even if the memory space of tasks is disjoint, their memory blocks usually map into a shared cache. As a result, task preemption may introduce additional cache misses which are encountered when the preempted task resumes execution; the delay due to these additional misses is called CRPD. Previous work on accounting for CRPD was restricted to only static priority schedulers and periodic task models. Our work extends these results to dynamic priority schedulers and more general task models (e.g. sporadic, generalized multiframe and recurring real-time). The authors show that the schedulability tests are useful through extensive experiments using synthetic task sets, as well as through a detailed case study","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212044","","Delay effects;Dynamic scheduling;Microarchitecture;Performance analysis;Pipelines;Processor scheduling;Resumes;Testing;Timing;Vehicle dynamics","cache storage;delays;scheduling;timing","CRPD;cache-related preemption delay;memory blocks;schedulability analysis;synthetic task sets;task preemption;timing effects","","8","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Per-core voltages can be used to bring all cores to the same performance level, but this compensation strategy also affects power, chiefly due to leakage power. Boosting a core's frequency may therefore boost its leakage sufficiently to engage thermal throttling.

This paper focuses on a major aspect of moving running tasks to free space for new incoming tasks (compaction). We study the effect of compacting running tasks to free more contiguous space on the system performance. First, we introduce a straightforward compaction strategy called blind compaction. We use its performance as a reference to measure the performance of other compaction algorithms. Then we propose a two-dimensional compaction algorithm called one-corner compaction. This algorithm runs with respect to one chip corner. We further extend this algorithm to the four corners of the chip and introduce the 4-corner compaction algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance of these algorithms with some existing compaction strategies (Diessel, 2000). The simulation results show improvement in average task allocation time when using the 4-corner compaction algorithm by 15% and in chip utilization by 16% over the blind compaction.

In this context, bounded model checking (BMC) is one of the most successful techniques. But even if all specified properties can be verified, it is difficult to determine whether they cover the complete functional behavior of a design. We propose a pragmatic approach to estimate coverage in BMC. The approach can easily be integrated in a BMC tool with only minor changes. In our approach, a coverage property is generated for each important signal. If the considered properties do not describe the signal's entire behavior, the coverage property fails and a counter-example is generated. From the counter-example an uncovered scenario can be derived. In this way the approach also helps in design understanding. Our method is demonstrated on a RISC CPU.

It is accomplished by a synthesis technique that (a) isolates and predicts the set of paths that may become critical under variations, (b) ensures they are activated rarely, and (c) tolerates possible delay failures (at reduced voltage) in these paths by adaptive clock stretching. This allows us to schedule a lower supply voltage during increased temperature without requiring frequency tuning. Simulation results on an example pipeline show that proposed design yields similar temperature reduction as conventional design with only 11% performance penalty and 14% area overhead.

Since the generated heat degrades the performance of the chip, thermally insensitive/adaptive circuit design techniques are required for better overall system performance. In this paper, we propose a thermally adaptive 3D clocking scheme that dynamically adjusts the driving strengths of the clock buffers to reduce the clock skew between terminals.

Such effects must be considered during the process of interconnect design. In this paper, one important argument is that the traditional linear dependence between wire resistance and wire width is no longer adequate for high layer interconnects due to the adiabatic property of these wires. By using curve fitting technique, we propose a quadratic model to represent the resistance of interconnect, which is aware of the thermal effects. Based on this model and the Elmore delay model, we derived a linear optimal wire sizing formula in form of f(x) = ax + b.

A key characteristic of the framework is that uncertainties are effectively captured by a partially observable semi-Markov decision process. As a result, the proposed framework brings the underlying probabilistic PVT effects to the forefront of power management policy determination.

On the other hand, technology limitations, data footprint and cost constraints lead to platform instantiations with only few on-chip memory devices and with a global performance bottleneck: the memory controller for access to the off-chip SDRAM memory. The complex interaction among system components and the dependency of macroscopic performance metrics on fine-grain architectural features stress the importance of highly accurate modelling and analysis tools.

Under large process variations, the path and arc/node criticality provide effective metrics in guiding circuit optimization. To facilitate the criticality computation considering the correlation, the authors define the critical region for the path and arc/node in a timing graph, and propose an efficient method to compute the criticality for paths and arcs/nodes simultaneously by a single breadth-first graph traversal during the backward propagation. Instead of choosing a set of paths for analysis prematurely, we develop a new property of the path criticality to prune those paths with low criticality at very earlier stages, so that our path criticality computation method has linear complexity with respect of the timing edges in a timing graph. To improve the computation accuracy, cutset and path criticality properties are exploited to calibrate the computation results.

However, to meet the tight constraints of embedded application, it is often required to customize the processor for the application. Customizing instruction-based processors is difficult and very challenging. Design approaches based on statically-scheduled horizontal-microcoded architectures have been proposed to simplify the architecture customization. In these approaches, first the datapath is specified by the designer, and then the operations of the datapath are extracted automatically. Since the operations are statically scheduled in these architectures (i) low-level programming using assembly is impossible or very tedious; and (ii) execution of programs cannot be interrupted arbitrarily. This paper addressed the above problems. The paper shows how to efficiently handle interrupts in such architectures and also propose an elegant way of controlling low-level hardware resources in a general way in C language.

The results demonstrate that FPGAs utilizing SWCNT bundle interconnect can achieve a 19% improvement in average area delay product over the best performing architecture for standard copper interconnect in 22 nm process technology","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211814","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Carbon nanotubes;Copper;Costs;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Routing;Wires","carbon nanotubes;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing","22 nm;CMOS process technology;FPGA architectures;FPGA interconnect fabric;carbon nanotube bundle interconnect;field programmable gate arrays;single-walled carbon nanotubes;wire internal population;wire segmentation distribution","","29","","29","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional thermal management techniques sacrifice performance to control the thermal behavior by slowing down or turning off the processors when a critical temperature threshold is exceeded. Moreover, studies have shown that in addition to high temperatures, temporal and spatial variations in temperature impact system reliability. In this work, we explore the benefits of thermally aware task scheduling for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We design and evaluate OS-level dynamic scheduling policies with negligible performance overhead. We show that, using simple to implement policies that make decisions based on temperature measurements, better temporal and spatial thermal profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art schedulers. We also enhance reactive strategies such as dynamic thread migration with our scheduling policies. This way, hot spots and temperature variations are decreased, and the performance cost is significantly reduced","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212050","","Circuits;Cooling;Costs;Dynamic scheduling;Power system management;Processor scheduling;Temperature control;Thermal management;Timing;Turning","dynamic scheduling;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","MPSoC;deep submicron circuits;dynamic scheduling;dynamic thread migration;multiprocessor systems on a chip;reactive strategies;scheduling policies;state-of-art schedulers;task scheduling;temperature aware;temperature measurements","","61","2","30","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based upon converting system models into the uniform input language of our efficient multi-domain constraint solving library, ABSOLVER, which is then used for subsequent analysis. Basically, ABSOLVER is an extensible SMT-solver which addresses mixed Boolean and (nonlinear) arithmetic constraint problems as they appear in the design of hybrid control systems. It allows the integration and semantic connection of various domain specific solvers via a logical circuit, such that almost arbitrary multi-domain constraint problems can be formulated and solved. Its design has been tailored for extensibility, and thus facilitates the reuse of expert knowledge, in that the most appropriate solver for a given task can be integrated and used. As such the only constraint over the problem domain is the capability of the employed solvers. Our approach to systems verification has been validated in an industrial case study using the model of a car's steering control system. However, additional benchmarks show that other hard instances of problems could also be solved by ABSOLVER in respectable time, and that for some instances, ABsOLVER's approach was the only means of solving a problem at all","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211921","","Arithmetic;Automatic control;Circuits;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Libraries;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems","Boolean functions;computability;constraint theory;control engineering computing;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;formal verification","ABSOLVER;Boolean constraint problems;MATLAB/Simulink;arithmetic constraint problems;car's steering control system;domain specific solvers;embedded control systems;hybrid control systems;logical circuit;multidomain constraint solving library;tool-support","","3","1","12","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These operators need several cycles to execute one operation, but the entire functional unit is not used in any cycle. Additionally, the execution of operations over wider multi-cycle operators is unfeasible if their results must be available in a smaller number of cycles than the functional unit delay. This obliges to add new functional resources to the datapath even if multi-cycle operators are idle when the execution of the operation begins. In this paper a new design technique to overcome the restricted reusability of multi-cycle operators is presented. It reduces the area of these functional units allowing their internal reuse when executing one operation. It also expands the possibilities of common hardware sharing as it allows the partial use of multicycle operators to calculate narrower operations faster than the functional unit delay.

The authors then show that for typical IC packages and cooling structures, a given amount of heat introduced at any position in the active layer will have similar impact on the average temperature of the layer. These two observations allow us to prove that, for wide ranges of design styles and operating temperatures, extremely fast, coarse-grained thermal models, combined with linear leakage power consumption models, permit highly-accurate system-wide leakage power consumption estimation.

Their use in safety-critical systems is considered as impossible nowadays since they must be strictly validated, and DPR brings many new issues. Indeed, the tools used for DPR must be certified, which is barely impossible for the current DPR tools provided by the vendors.

This lessens the complexity of tools certification, and make a step towards enabling the certification of DPR for safety-critical applications.

The problems of this approach are immense cost and long time of designing. To address these issues, an adaptive extensible processor was proposed in which custom instructions (CIs) are generated and added after chip-fabrication. To support this feature, custom functional units are replaced by a reconfigurable matrix of functional units with the capability of conditional execution. Unlike previous proposed CIs, it can include multiple exits. Experimental results show that multi-exit CIs enhance the performance by 46% in average compared to CIs limited to one basic block.

Prior techniques advocated full scale structural or temporal redundancy to achieve fault tolerance. Though they can provide complete fault coverage, they incur significant hardware and/or performance cost. It is desirable to have mechanisms that can provide partial but sufficiently high fault coverage with negligible cost. To meet this goal, we propose leveraging speculative structures that already exist in modern processors. The proposed mechanism is based on the insight that when a fault occurs, it is likely that the incorrect execution would result in abnormally higher or lower number of mispredictions (branch mispredictions, L2 misses, store set mispredictions) than a correct execution. We design a simple transient fault predictor that detects the anomalous behavior in the outcomes of the speculative structures to predict transient faults","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211958","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Costs;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Microprocessors;Noise level;Noise reduction;Redundancy","CMOS integrated circuits;fault tolerance;microprocessor chips;redundancy;transistors","CMOS scaling;L2 misses;branch mispredictions;fault tolerance;leveraging speculative structures;microprocessors;store set mispredictions;temporal redundancy;transient errors;transient fault prediction;transistors","","1","","21","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More importantly, our algorithm runs very fast and comes reasonably close to the theoretical limit of energy optimization using DVS+ABB. At 65 nm technology, we improve the energy dissipation of the generated code by an average of11.4% under deadline constraints. While our technique's improvement in energy dissipation over conventional DVS is marginal (3%) at 130nm, the average improvement continues to grow to 4.7%, 8.8% and 15.4% for 90nm, 65nm and 45nm technology nodes, respectively.

Therefore, block ciphers are difficult to implement efficiently on embedded devices like cell phones or sensor nodes where run-time memory and program ROM are scarce resources. In this paper, the performance, energy consumption, runtime memory requirements, and code size of the five block ciphers RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, and XTEA on the StrongARM SA-1100 processor was analyzed and compared. Most previous evaluations of block ciphers considered performance as the sole metric of interest and did not care about memory requirements or code size. In contrast to previous work, this study of the performance and energy characteristics of block ciphers has been conducted with ""lightweight"" implementations which restrict the size of lookup tables to 1 kB and also impose constraints on the code size. The author found that Rijndael and RC6 can be well optimized for high performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time meeting the demand for low memory (RAM and ROM) footprint. In addition, the impact of key expansion and modes of operation on the overall performance and energy consumption of each block cipher was discussed. Simulation results show that RC6 is the most energy-efficient block cipher under memory constraints and thus the best choice for resource-restricted devices","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364443","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211953","Lightweight cryptography;code size reduction;energy optimization;memory footprint;symmetric cipher","Cellular phones;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Memory management;Performance analysis;Random access memory;Read only memory;Runtime;Software performance;Table lookup","cryptography;embedded systems;energy consumption;microprocessor chips;semiconductor storage","1 kByte;RC6;Rijndael;Serpent;StrongARM SA-1100 processor;Twofish;XTEA;block cipher software implementation;code size reduction;energy evaluation;lightweight cryptography;lightweight implementations;memory constraints;memory footprint;runtime memory requirements;symmetric cipher","","2","","19","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first program is executed by one of the decoupled processors called Access which uses compiler methods for placing data in the memory hierarchy. In parallel, the second program is executed by the other processor called Execute. The synchronization of the memory hierarchy and the Execute processor is achieved through simple handshake protocol. The Access processor requires strong communication with the memory hierarchy which strongly differentiates it from traditional uniprocessors. The architecture is compared in performance with the MIPS IV architecture of SimpleScalar and with the existing decoupled architectures showing its higher normalized performance.

This problem, known as the loop scheduling problem, has been studied in the past, and several schemes, both static and dynamic, have been proposed. One of the attractive features of dynamic schemes, as compared to their static counterparts, is their ability of exploiting the latency variations across the execution times of the different loop iterations. In all the dynamic loop scheduling techniques proposed in literature so far, performance has been the primary metric of interest. In a battery-operated embedded execution environment, however, power consumption is another metric to consider during iteration-to-processor assignment. In particular, in a banked memory system, this assignment can have an important impact on memory power consumption, which can be a significant portion of the overall energy consumption, especially for data-intensive embedded applications such as those from the domain of image data processing. This paper presents a bank aware dynamic loop scheduling scheme for array-intensive embedded media applications. The goal behind this new scheduling scheme is to minimize the number of memory banks that need to be used for executing the current working set (group of loop iterations) when all processors are considered together. That is, during the loop iteration-to-processor assignment, our approach considers the bank access patterns of loop iterations and carefully selects the set of iterations to assign to an idle processor so that, if possible, the number of memory banks that are used at the current state is not increased. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheduling scheme leads to much better energy results when compared to prior loop scheduling techniques and it is also competitive with the scheduler that generates the best performance.

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Program code in a computer system can be altered either by malicious security attacks or by various faults in microprocessors. At the instruction level, all code modifications are manifested as bit flips. In this work, we present a generalized methodology for monitoring code integrity at run-time in application-specific instruction set processors (ASIPs), where both the instruction set architecture (ISA) and the underlying micro architecture can be customized for a particular application domain. We embed monitoring microoperations in machine instructions, thus the processor is augmented with a hardware monitor automatically. The monitor observes the processor's execution trace of basic blocks at run-time, checks whether the execution trace aligns with the expected program behavior, and signals any mismatches. Since microoperations are at a lower software architecture level than processor instructions, the microarchitectural support for program code integrity monitoring is transparent to upper software levels and no recompilation or modification is needed for the program. Experimental results show that our microarchitectural support can detect program code integrity compromises with small area overhead and little performance degradation","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211901","","Application specific processors;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Hardware;Instruction sets;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Runtime;Signal processing","codes;instruction sets;microprocessor chips","ASIP;application specific instruction set processors;microarchitectural support;microprocessors;program code integrity;security attacks","","5","","20","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Process splitting is performed by a tool -SplitPro- which generates an optimized code that can be run on any standard SystemC engine.

Previous dynamic cache tuning approaches change the cache configuration several times as part of the tuning search process, executing the application using inferior configurations and temporarily causing energy and performance overhead. The introduced tuner uses a different approach, which non-intrusively collects data on addresses issued by the microprocessor, analyzes that data to predict the best cache configuration, and then updates the cache to the new best configuration in ""one-shot"", without ever having to examine inferior configurations. The result is less energy and less performance overhead, meaning that cache tuning can be applied more frequently. We show through experiments that the one-shot cache tuner can reduce memory-access related energy for instructions by 35% and comes within 4% of a previous intrusive approach, and results in 4.6 times less energy overhead and a 7.7 times speedup in tuning time compared to a previous intrusive approach, at the main expense of 12% larger size","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211891","","Application software;Computer aided instruction;Computer science;Data engineering;Embedded computing;Genetics;Hardware;Microprocessors;Power engineering and energy;Tuners","cache storage;circuit tuning;microprocessor chips","cache configuration;dynamic cache tuning;microprocessor;nonintrusive on-chip cache-tuning hardware module;one-shot configurable-cache tuner;tuning search process","","8","","28","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Employing a data memory space much larger than needed has negative consequences on the energy consumption, latency, and chip area. Finding an optimized storage of the usually large arrays from these algorithmic specifications is an important step during memory allocation. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for mapping multi-dimensional arrays to the data memory. Similarly presented in R. Toncon et al., 2002, it computes bounding windows for live elements in the index space of arrays, but this algorithm is several times faster. Moreover, since this algorithm works not only for entire arrays, but also parts of arrays-like, for instance, array references or, more general, sets of array elements represented by lattices (Schrijver, 1986), this signal-to-memory mapping technique can be also applied in multi-layer memory hierarchies","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211827","","Circuits;Computational modeling;Computer science;Delay effects;Difference equations;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Lattices;Signal mapping;Signal processing algorithms","memory architecture;multimedia systems;parallel processing;program control structures","array-dominated loop-organized algorithmic specifications;bounding windows;data memory;embedded systems;hierarchical memory organizations;memory allocation;multidimensional signals mapping;multilayer memory hierarchy;optimized storage;signal-to-memory mapping technique;storage requirements","","3","","15","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of linear models has been proven to be very critical in many today's applications. Even for well-behaved performance functions, linearising approaches as well as quadratic model provide serious errors in calculating expected value, variance and higher central moments. This paper presents a novel approach to analyse the impacts of process variations with low efforts and minimum assumption. Circuit performance was formulated as a function of the random parameters and approximated it by Taylor expansion up to 4th order. Taking advantage of the knowledge about higher moments, the Taylor series was converted to characteristics of performance distribution. The experiments show that this approach provides extremely exact results even in strongly non-linear problems with large process variations. Its simplicity, efficiency and accuracy make this approach a promising alternative to the Monte Carlo method in most practical applications","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364598","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211803","","Acceleration;Circuit optimization;Delay;Fluctuations;Manufacturing;Microelectronics;Monte Carlo methods;Power system modeling;Sampling methods;Taylor series","analogue integrated circuits;circuit simulation;network analysis;nonlinear functions","CMCal;Taylor expansion;circuit performance;nonGaussian parameter;nonlinear function;performance distribution;process variations","","0","","21","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For embedded systems, its benefits can be even pushed further by properly matching the partition to the memory access patterns. When leakage energy comes into play, however, idle memory blocks must be put into a proper low-leakage sleep state to actually save energy when not accessed. In this case, the matching becomes an instance of power management problem, because moving to and from this sleep state requires additional energy. In this work, we propose an explorative solution to the problem of leakage-aware partitioning of a memory into disjoint sub-blocks. In particular, we target scratchpad memories, which are commonly used in some embedded systems as a replacement of caches. We show that the total energy (dynamic and static) cost function yields a non-convex partitioning space, making smart exploration the only viable option; we propose an effective randomized search in the solution space which has very good match with the results of exhaustive exploration, when this is feasible. Experiments on a different sets of embedded applications has shown that total energy savings larger than 60% on average can be obtained, with a marginal overhead in execution time, thanks to an effective implementation of the low-leakage sleep state","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212051","","Cost function;Embedded system;Energy management;Leakage current;Memory management;Partitioning algorithms;Power system management;Scanning probe microscopy;Sleep;Space exploration","cache storage;electrical faults;embedded systems","caches;embedded systems;idle memory blocks;leakage aware management;leakage energy;memory access patterns;multiple blocks;non-convex partitioning space;scratchpad memories;smart exploration","","10","","21","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, FPGA devices are mostly used to implement digital baseband and intermediate frequency (IF) functionalities. Therefore, significant analog and RF components are still needed to fulfill the radio communication requirements. The all-digital transmitter presented in this paper directly synthesizes RF signal in the digital domain, therefore eliminates the need for most of the analog and RF components. The all-digital transmitter consists of one QAM modulator and one RF pulse width modulator (RFPWM). The binary output waveform from RFPWM is centered at 800MHz with 64QAM signaling format. The entire transmitter is implemented using Xilinx Virtex2pro device with on chip multi-gigabit transceiver (MGT). The adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) measured in the 20 MHz passband is 45dB, and the measured error vector magnitude (EVM) is less than 1%.

However, for many resource-constrained embedded systems, the size and cost overheads of a separate trusted platform module (TPM) chip are not acceptable. One alternative is to use a software-based TPM (SW-TPM), which implements TPM functions using software that executes in a protected execution domain on the embedded processor itself. However, since many embedded systems have limited processing capabilities and are battery-powered, it is also important to ensure that the computational and energy requirements for SW-TPMs are acceptable. In this work, an evaluation of the energy and execution time overheads for a SW-TPM implementation on a Sharp Zaurus PDA was performed. The execution time and energy required by each TPM command was characterized through actual measurements on the target platform. In addition, the overheads of using SW-TPM in the context of various end applications, including trusted boot of the Linux operating system (OS), secure file storage, secure VoIP client, and secure Web browser was also evaluated. Furthermore, it was observed that for most TPM commands, the overheads are primarily due to the use of 2048-bit RSA operations that are performed within SW-TPM. In order to alleviate SW-TPM overheads, the use of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as a replacement for the RSA algorithm specified in the trusted computing group (TCG) standards was evaluated. Experiments indicate that this optimization can significantly reduce SW-TPM overheads (an average of 6.51times execution time reduction and 6.75times energy consumption reduction for individual TPM commands, and an average of 10.25times execution time reduction and 10.75times energy consumption reduction for applications). This work demonstrates that ECC-based SW-TPMs are a viable approach to realizing the benefits of trusted computing in resource-constrained embedded systems","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211956","","Costs;Elliptic curve cryptography;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Performance evaluation;Personal digital assistants;Protection;Security","Internet telephony;Linux;cryptography;embedded systems;energy consumption;notebook computers","Linux operating system;Sharp Zaurus PDA;elliptic curve cryptography;energy analysis;execution time analysis;general-purpose computing system security;resource-constrained embedded systems;secure VoIP;secure Web browser;secure file storage;software-based trusted platform module;trusted computing group","","9","","25","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Resource prediction refers to predicting required compute power and energy resources for consuming a service on a device. Resource prediction is extremely useful in a client-server setup where the client requests a media service from the server or content provider. The content provider (in cooperation with the client) can then determine what service quality to deliver given the client's available resources. This paper proposes a practical approach to predicting resources for decoding media streams. The idea is to group frames with similar decode complexity from various media streams in the content provider's database into so called scenarios. Client profiling using scenario representatives characterizes the client's computational power. This enables the content provider for predicting decode time, decode energy and quality of service for a media stream of interest once deployed on the client","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211863","","Batteries;Databases;Decoding;Encoding;Energy consumption;Energy resources;Prediction methods;Proposals;Quality of service;Streaming media","client-server systems;decoding;media streaming;quality of service;video coding","client profiling;client-server setup;media stream decoding;quality of service;resource prediction","","4","","18","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","SRT division is an efficient method for implementing high radix division circuits. However, as the radix increases the size of a quotient digit selection table increases exponentially. To overcome the limitations of quotient prediction, a method in which a quotient digit is speculated has been proposed. The speculated quotient digit is utilised to update the possible partial remainders while the speculated quotient is corrected. In this paper, instead of using a huge quotient selection table an estimation and correction scheme is used for prediction of quotient digit. The prediction is done in parallel with the calculation of the partial remainder for the quotient predicted earlier thus improving the latency. In addition, since this method tends to consume less area as the radix increases compared to previous methods, it has the ability to improve higher radix implementations for SRT division","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211795","","Circuits;Delay","digital arithmetic;dividing circuits;estimation theory","high radix division circuits;operand scaling;partial remainder;quotient digit prediction;quotient prediction;quotient selection table;radix 4 SRT division method","","0","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vendors often use proprietary platforms which are incompatible with others. Therefore, porting software is a very complex and time consuming task. Moreover, lots of existing embedded processors do not have SIMD extensions at all. But they do provide a wide data path which is 32-bit or wider. Usually, multimedia applications work on short data types of 8 or 16-bit. Thus, only the lower bits of the data path are used and therefore only a fraction of the available computing power is exploited for such algorithms. This paper discusses the possibility to make use of the upper bits of the data path by emulating true SIMD instructions. These instructions are implemented purely in software using a high level language such as C. Therefore, the application can be modified by making use of source code transformations which are inherently portable. The benefit of this approach is that the computing resources are used more efficiently without compromising the portability of the code. Experiments have shown that a significant speedup can be obtained by this approach","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211995","","Application software;Assembly;Costs;Embedded system;Hardware;High level languages;Manufacturing processes;Programming;Signal processing algorithms;Software algorithms","C language;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;multimedia systems;parallel processing","16 bit;32 bit;8 bit;C language;SIMD instructions;SoftSIMD;data path;embedded processors;high level language;high performance embedded computing;multimedia applications;source code transformations;subword parallelism","","0","","13","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, regular mesh topology is unrealistic due to variations in module sizes and shapes, and is not suitable for application-specific NoCs. Consequently, simplistic routing techniques such as XY routing are inadequate, raising the need for low cost alternatives which can work in irregular mesh networks. In this paper we present a novel technique for reducing the total hardware cost of routing tables for both source and distributed routing approaches. The proposed technique is based on applying a fixed routing function combined with minimal deviation tables that are used only when the routing decisions for a given destination deviate from the predefined routing function. We apply this methodology to compare three hardware efficient routing methods for irregular mesh topology NoCs. For each method, we develop path selection algorithms that minimize the overall cost of routing tables. Finally, we demonstrate by simulations on random and specific real application network instances a significant cost saving compared to standard solutions, and examine the scaling of cost savings with growing NoC size","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211924","","Costs;Hardware;Logic;Network interfaces;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Radio access networks;Routing;Shape;Telecommunication traffic","network routing;network topology;network-on-chip","distributed routing approaches;hardware efficient routing methods;irregular mesh topology NoC;network on chip;path selection algorithms;routing table minimization;source routing approaches","","14","","24","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, compared with the PFA (principal factor analysis) modeling of geometric variations, the K-L (Karhunen-Loeve) expansion involved in SSCM can be independent of the discretization of conductors, thus significantly reduces the computation cost. Secondly, compared with the perturbation method, the stochastic spectral method based on homogeneous chaos expansion has optimal (exponential) convergence rate, which makes SSCM applicable to most geometric variation cases. Furthermore, sparse grid combined with a MST (minimum spanning tree) representation is proposed to reduce the number of sampling points and the computation time for capacitance extraction at each sampling point.

In contrast, a single-ended code enables the memory controller to encode data stored in memory and subsequently decode that data when it is retrieved, allowing the use of commodity memories.

Very often, however, this approach suffers limited insight. To gain insight into nonlinear behavior, we use a multisine analysis methodology to locate the main nonlinear components (e.g. transistors) both for weakly and strongly nonlinear behavior. Under weakly nonlinear conditions, selective Volterra analysis is used to further determine the most important nonlinearities of the main nonlinear components. As shown with an example of a 90 nm CMOS wideband low-noise amplifier, the insights obtained with this approach can be used to reduce nonlinear circuit behavior, in this case with 10 dB. The approach is valid for wideband and thus practical excitation signals, and is easily applicable both to simple and complex circuits","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211806","","Circuit simulation;Crosstalk;Information analysis;Low-noise amplifiers;MOS capacitors;MOSFETs;Nonlinear circuits;Nonlinear distortion;Radio frequency;Wideband","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Volterra series;analogue processing circuits;low noise amplifiers;radiofrequency amplifiers","90 nm;CMOS wideband low-noise amplifier;RF circuits;Volterra analysis;analog circuits;multisine analysis;nonlinear circuit behavior reduction;nonlinear component nonlinearity;nonlinearity analysis","","9","","8","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the authors first investigate the impact of NBTI on PMOS devices and propose a novel temporal performance degradation model for digital circuits considering the temperature difference between active and standby mode. For the first time, the impact of input vector control (to minimize standby leakage) on the NBTI is investigated. Minimum leakage vectors, which lead to minimum circuit performance degradation and remains maximum leakage reduction rate, are selected and used during the standby mode. Furthermore, the potential to save the circuit performance degradation by internal node control techniques during circuit standby mode is discussed. Our simulation results show that: 1) the active and standby time ratio and the standby mode temperature have considerable impact on the circuit performance degradation; 2) the NBTI-aware IVC technique leads to an average 3% savings of the total circuit degradation; while the potential of internal node control may lead to 10% savings of the total circuit degradation","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211855","","Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Degradation;Digital circuits;MOS devices;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Temperature control;Threshold voltage;Titanium compounds","MOS digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;thermal stability","NBTI;PMOS threshold voltage;circuit reliability;circuit standby mode;digital circuits;input vector control;internal node control;negative bias temperature instability;performance degradation","","24","","18","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In conventional embedded architectures, the register file capacity cannot be increased without resorting to longer instruction words. Similarly, loop unrolling is often required to exploit locality in the register file accesses across iterations because naming registers statically is inflexible. Both optimizations lead to significant code size increases, which is undesirable in embedded systems. In this paper, the authors introduce the register pointer architecture (RPA), which allows registers to be accessed indirectly through register pointers. Indirection allows a larger register file to be used without increasing the length of instruction words. Additional register file capacity allows many loads and stores, such as those introduced by spill code, to be eliminated, which improves performance and reduces energy consumption. Moreover, indirection affords additional flexibility in naming registers, which reduces the need to apply loop unrolling in order to maximize reuse of register allocated variables","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211864","","Application software;Arithmetic;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Laboratories;Microarchitecture;Registers","embedded systems;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;storage allocation","embedded processors;loop unrolling;register file capacity;register pointer architecture;spill code;static encoding","","2","4","11","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such energy harvesting systems, energy sources are characterized as being regenerative. Regenerative energy sources fundamentally change the problem of power scheduling for embedded devices. Instead of the problem being one of maximizing the lifetime of the system given a total amount of energy, as in traditional battery powered devices, the problem becomes one of preventing energy depletion at any given time. Coupling relatively computationally intensive applications, such as video processing applications, with the constrained FPGAs that are feasible on power constrained embedded systems, makes dynamic reconfiguration essential. It provides the speed comparable to a hardware implementation, but it also allows the dynamic reconfiguration to meet the multiple application needs of the system. Different applications can be loaded on the FPGA, as the system's needs change over time. The problem becomes how to schedule the dynamic reconfiguration to appropriately make use of the regenerative energy source, to ensure the proper availability of energy for the system over time. This paper presents a methodology for carrying out dynamic reconfiguration for regenerative energy sources, based on statistical analysis of tasks and supply energy. The approach is evaluated through extensive simulations. Additionally, the implementation has been evaluated on regenerative energy, dynamically reconfigurable prototype, known as the MicrelEye. The approach is shown to miss 57.7% less deadlines on average than the current approach for reconfiguration with regenerative energy sources","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211943","","Batteries;Computer applications;Dynamic scheduling;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Statistical analysis","embedded systems;power aware computing;wireless sensor networks","MicrelEye;dynamic reconfiguration;embedded devices;energy harvesting systems;highly power constrained sensor networks;power scheduling;regenerative energy sources;statistical analysis","","4","","16","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The impact of substrate noise is modeled a priori in a high-ohmic 0.18mum 1P6M CMOS technology and then verified on silicon on a 900MHz LC-VCO. Below a frequency of 10MHz, the impact is dominated by the on-chip resistance of the VCO ground, while above 10MHz the bond wires, parasitics of the on-chip inductor and the PCB decoupling capacitors determine the behavior of the perturbation","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212026","","Analytical models;Bonding;CMOS technology;Frequency;Local oscillators;Semiconductor device modeling;Silicon;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wideband;Wires","CMOS integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;circuit simulation;integrated circuit noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","0.18 micron;10 MHz;900 MHz;CMOS technology;PCB decoupling capacitors;VCO;on-chip inductor;on-chip resistance;substrate noise;voltage controlled oscillator","","4","","13","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we explore customization in the context of multi-tasking real-time embedded systems. We propose efficient algorithms to select the optimal set of custom instructions for a task set under two popular real-time scheduling policies. Our algorithms minimize the processor utilization through customization while satisfying the task deadlines and the constraint on silicon area. Experimental evaluation with various task sets shows that appropriate customization can achieve significant reduction in the processor utilization and the energy consumption","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212018","","Computer aided instruction;Dynamic scheduling;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Silicon;Timing;Voltage","embedded systems;instruction sets;microprocessor chips","application specific customization;energy consumption;instruction set;multi tasking;processor utilization;real time embedded systems","","5","","12","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept is based on a separation of pixel-level operations and high level application code. Pixel-level operations are accelerated by coprocessors, whereas high level application code is implemented fully programmable on standard PowerPC CPU cores to allow flexibility for new algorithms. In addition, the application code is able to dynamically reconfigure the coprocessors available on the system, allowing for a much larger set of hardware accelerated functionality than would normally fit onto a device. This process makes use of the partial dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of Xilinx Virtex FPGAs","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211847","","Acceleration;Automotive engineering;Cameras;Code standards;Coprocessors;Driver circuits;Hardware;Road transportation;Signal processing;Vehicles","coprocessors;real-time systems;reconfigurable architectures;video signal processing","Xilinx Virtex FPGA;application code;driver assistance system;partial dynamic reconfiguration capabilities;partial-run-time reconfigurable hardware;reconfigurable hardware architecture;video processing","","17","","15","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","In this paper the authors propose a hardware real time operating system (HW-RTOS) that implements the OS layer in a dual-processor SMP architecture. Intertask communication is specified by means of dedicated APIs and the HW-RTOS takes care of the communication requirements of the application and also implements the task scheduling algorithm. The HW-RTOS allows to have smaller footprints, since it avoids the need to link to the final executables traditional software RTOS libraries. Moreover, the HW-RTOS is able to exploit the easy task migration feature provided by an SMP architecture much more efficiently than a traditional software RTOS, due to its faster execution and the authors show how this significantly overcomes the performance achievable with optimal static task partitioning among two processors. Preliminary results show that the hardware overhead in a dual processor architecture is less than 20K gates","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211871","","Acceleration;Application software;Computer architecture;Embedded system;Hardware;Job shop scheduling;Multitasking;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Silicon","application program interfaces;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers);processor scheduling","SMP architecture;application program interfaces;hardware scheduling support;intertask communication;real time operating system;task migration;task partitioning;task scheduling","","4","","14","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DATE '07","20070529","2007","","","1","6","Field programmable dual-Vdd interconnects are effective to reduce FPGA power. However, the deterministic Vdd assignment leverages timing slack exhaustively and significantly increases the number of near-critical paths, which results in a degraded timing yield with process variation. In this paper, we present two statistical Vdd assignment algorithms. The first greedy algorithm is based on sensitivity while the second one is based on timing slack budgeting. Both minimize chip-level interconnect power without degrading timing yield. Evaluated with MCNC circuits, the statistical algorithms reduce interconnect power by 40% compared to the single- Vdd FPGA with power gating. In contrast, the deterministic algorithm reduces interconnect power by 51% but degrades timing yield from 97.7% to 87.5%","","978-3-9810801-2-4","","10.1109/DATE.2007.364665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4211870","","Degradation;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Greedy algorithms;Integrated circuit interconnections;Switches;Switching converters;Timing;Wire;Yield estimation","deterministic algorithms;field programmable gate arrays;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit interconnections;statistical analysis;timing","chip-level interconnect;field programmable gate arrays;process variation;timing slack budgeting;timing yield","","2","","21","","","16-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
