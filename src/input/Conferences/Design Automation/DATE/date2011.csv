It is especially distracting when re-using an existing design for a similar specification or when transferring a working design to a new technology. This paper presents a new methodology for layout generation of analog circuits that is based on a modular circuit design and a so-called ""executable design flow description"". This is created once manually and allows to describe the layout in a technology independent and parameterizable manner assuring a consistent view of circuit and layout design. Complex layouts can be created in negligible time, achieving an early involvement of layout effects in the circuit design. Furthermore, the parameterization of the design description allows simplified technology transfer and seamless access to sizing tools.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763267","analog circuits;circuit design;layout design;parametrizable design cells","Analog circuits;Automation;Design automation;Generators;IP networks;Layout;Optimization","analogue circuits;circuit layout;network synthesis","analog circuit design;executable design flow description;generator-based approach;layout design;layout generation;modular circuit design;working design","","1","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous circuit design challenges for the implementation of optimal integrated neural recording systems are still present and need to be addressed. In this paper we present the systematic design of a programmable low-noise multi-channel neural interface that can be used for the recording of neural activity in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The design methodology includes modeling and simulation of important parameters, allowing the definition, optimization and testing of the architecture and the circuit blocks. In the proposed architecture, individual channel programmability is provided in order to address different neural signals and electrode characteristics. A 16-channel fully-differential architecture is fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology, with a die size of 5.6 mm × 4.5 mm. Gains (40-75.6 dB) and band-pass filter cut-off frequencies (1-6000 Hz) can be digitally programmed using 7 bits per channel and a serial interface. The circuit consumes a maximum of 1.8 mA from a 3.3 V supply and the measured input-referred noise is between 2.3 and 2.9 μV<sub>rms</sub> for the different configurations.

"Logic synthesis and physical design: Quo vadis?","De Micheli, G.","EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2011","20110505","2011","","","1","1","Virtually all current integrated circuits and systems would not exist without the use of logic synthesis and physical design tools. These design technologies were developed in the last fifty years and it is hard to say if they have come to full maturity. Physical design evolved from methods used for printed-circuit boards, where the classic problems of placement and routing surfaced for the first time. Logic synthesis evolved in a different trajectory, starting from the classic works on switching theory, but took a sharp turn in the eighties when multi-level logic synthesis, coupled to semicustom technologies, provided designers with a means to map models in hardware description languages into netlists ready for physical design. The clear separation between logic and physical design tasks enabled the development of effective design tool flows, where signoff could be done at the netlist level. Nevertheless, the relentless downscaling of semiconductor technologies forced this separation to disappear, once circuit delays became interconnect-dominated. Since the nineties, design flows combined logic and physical design tools to address the so-called timing closure problem, i.e., to reduce the designer effort to synthesize a design that satisfies all timing constraints. Despite many efforts in various directions, most notably with the use of the fixed timing methodology, this problem is not completely solved yet. The complexity of integrated logic and physical tool flows, as well as the decrease in design starts of large ASICs, limits the development of these flows to a few EDA companies.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763015","","","logic design;network synthesis","ASIC;hardware description languages;integrated circuits;logic synthesis;physical design tools;printed-circuit boards;semiconductor technologies;switching theory;timing closure problem","","0","","9","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a SAMS-based communication link, the digital and analog blocks from the output of the information source at the transmitter to the input of the decision device in the receiver are treated as part of the composite channel. This comprehensive systems-level view enables us to compensate for impairments of not just the physical communication channel but also the intervening circuit blocks, most notably the analog/mixed-signal blocks. This is in stark contrast to what is done today, which is to treat the analog components in the transmitter and the analog front-end at the receiver as transparent waveform preservers. The benefits of the proposed system-aware mixed-signal design approach are illustrated in the context of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for high-speed links.

Functional testing, on the other hand, suffers from low coverage but can be applied at-speed. In this paper, we propose a novel three-step design-for-test (DFT) methodology which enhances the performance of functional testing to a great extent. In the first step we expand the state space of the circuit beyond functionally reachable space without scan or reset. These new states create conditions to activate/propagate fault effects that are otherwise hard-to-detect. Since structural correlation between D flip-flops (DFFs) of a circuit restricts its state space variation, the second step consists of partitioning the DFFs into different groups that helps to break such correlations. In the third step, we make internal hard-to-observe points in the circuit more observable by directly XORing them with selected primary outputs. This method can be applied at-speed (since no scan shifting is involved) saving significant amount of test application time, with comparable area overhead as scan-based DFT. Our experiments on large ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmarks show that we are able to achieve very high non-scan fault coverages while simultaneously reducing the test application time (114×) as compared to scan based techniques.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763041","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Discrete Fourier transforms;Logic gates;Observability;Pins","design for testability;flip-flops;state-space methods","D flip-flops;design-for-test methodology;fault coverage;functional testing;scan-based testing;state space","","1","","16","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as the power density of HPC systems increases with the arrival of 3D MPSoCs, supplying electrical power to the computing equipment and constantly removing the generated heat is rapidly becoming the dominant cost in any HPC facility. Thus, both power and thermal/cooling implications play a major role in the design of new HPC systems, given the energy constraints in our society. Therefore, EPFL, IBM and ETHZ have been working within the CMOSAIC Nano-Tera.ch program project in the last three years on the development of a holistic thermally-aware design. This paper presents the exploration in CMOSAIC of novel cooling technologies, as well as suitable thermal modeling and system-level design methods, which are all necessary to develop 3D MPSoCs with inter-tier liquid cooling systems. As a result, we develop energy-efficient run-time thermal control strategies to achieve energy-efficient cooling mechanisms to compress almost 1 Tera nano-sized functional units into one cubic centimeter with a 10 to 100 fold higher connectivity than otherwise possible. The proposed thermally-aware design paradigm includes exploring the synergies of hardware-, software- and mechanical-based thermal control techniques as a fundamental step to design 3D MPSoCs for HPC systems. More precisely, we target the use of inter-tier coolants ranging from liquid water and two-phase refrigerants to novel engineered environmentally friendly nano-fluids, as well as using specifically designed micro-channel arrangements, in combination with the use of dynamic thermal management at system-level to tune the flow rate of the coolant in each micro-channel to achieve thermally-balanced 3D-ICs. Our management strategy prevents the system from surpassing the given threshold temperature while achieving up to 67%- reduction in cooling energy and up to 30% reduction in system-level energy in comparison to setting the flow rate at the maximum value to handle the worst-case temperature.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763237","","Coolants;Heat transfer;Heating;Liquid cooling;Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays","cooling;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;system-on-chip","3D MPSoC;CMOSAIC Nano-Tera.ch program project;EPFL;ETHZ;HPC systems;IBM;dynamic thermal management;energy-efficient cooling mechanisms;energy-efficient run-time thermal control strategies;inter-tier liquid cooling systems;multi-processor system-on-chip;next-generation high-performance computing;thermally-aware design","","5","","18","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present new design of the reversible BCD adder that has been primarily optimized for the number of ancilla input bits and the number of garbage outputs. The number of ancilla input bits and the garbage outputs is primarily considered as an optimization criteria as it is extremely difficult to realize a quantum computer with many qubits. As the optimization of ancilla input bits and the garbage outputs may degrade the design in terms of the quantum cost and the delay, thus the quantum cost and the delay parameters are also considered for optimization with primary focus towards the optimization of the number of ancilla input bits and the garbage outputs. Firstly, we propose a new design of the reversible ripple carry adder having the input carry Co and is designed with no ancilla input bits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder design with no ancilla input bits has less quantum cost and the logic depth (delay) compared to its existing counterparts. The existing reversible Peres gate and a new reversible gate called the TR gate is efficiently utilized to improve the quantum cost and the delay of the reversible ripple carry adder. The improved quantum design of the TR gate is also illustrated. Finally, the reversible design of the BCD adder is presented which is based on a 4 bit reversible binary adder to add the BCD number, and finally the conversion of the binary result to the BCD format using a reversible binary to BCD converter.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763308","","Adders;Bismuth;Converters;Delay;Logic gates;Optimization;Quantum computing","adders;logic design","BCD converter;BCD format;optimization criteria;quantum computer;quantum computing;quantum cost;reversible BCD adder;reversible Peres gate;reversible binary adder;reversible logic design;reversible ripple carry adder design","","10","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Large distortions may lead to line open and bridge faults and the locations of such defects vary with lithographic process corner. Based on lithographic simulation, it is easily verified that for a given layout, changing one or more of the process parameters shifts the defect location. Thus, if the lithographic process corner of a die is known, test patterns can be better targeted for both hard and parametric defects. In this paper, we present design of control structures such that preliminary testing of these structures can uniquely identify the manufacturing process corner. If the manufacturing process corner is known, we can easily attain highest possible fault coverage for lithography related defects during manufacturing test.

In this paper, we present a novel design-level technique called probabilistic pruning to realize inexact circuits. Unlike the previous techniques in literature which relied mostly on some form of scaling of operational parameters such as the supply voltage (V<sub>dd</sub>) to achieve energy and accuracy tradeoffs, our technique uses pruning of portions of circuits having a lower probability of being active, as the basis for performing architectural modifications resulting in significant savings in energy, delay and area. Our approach yields more savings when compared to any of the conventional voltage scaling schemes, for similar error values. Extensive simulations using this pruning technique in a novel logic synthesis based CAD framework on various architectures of 64-bit adders demonstrate that normalized gains as great as 2X-7.5X in the Energy-Delay-Area product can be obtained, with a relative error percentage as low as 10<sup>-6</sup>% up to 10%, when compared to corresponding conventionally correct designs.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763130","","Accuracy;Adders;Delay;Design automation;Gain;Integrated circuit modeling;Probabilistic logic","adders;logic CAD;probability","CAD framework;Moore law;adders;design-level technique;energy parsimonious circuit design;energy-delay-area product;inexact circuit;logic synthesis;low nanometer range;probabilistic pruning;supply voltage;ultralow energy system","","16","","18","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional digital design strategies guarantee timing correctness of all operations, which leaves large quality margins in practical systems and sacrifices energy efficiency. This paper presents techniques to significantly improve energy efficiency by shaping the quality-energy tradeoff achievable via V<sub>DD</sub> scaling. In an unoptimized design, such scaling leads to rapid loss of quality due to the onset of timing errors. We introduce techniques that modify the behavior of the early and worst timing error offenders to allow for larger V<sub>DD</sub> reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on a 2D-IDCT design. The design was synthesized using a 45nm standard cell library. The experiments show that up to 45% energy savings can be achieved at a cost of 10dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The resulting PSNR remains above 30dB, which is a commonly accepted value for lossy image and video compression. Achieving such energy savings by direct V<sub>DD</sub> scaling without the proposed transformations results in a 35dB PSNR loss. The overhead for the needed control logic is less than 3% of the original design.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763129","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Digital signal processing;PSNR;Signal processing algorithms","discrete cosine transforms;video coding","2D-IDCT design;PSNR;SNR floor;control logic;digital design strategy;embedded DSP systems;embedded digital signal processing systems;lossy image compression;low-energy IDCT design;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quality-energy tradeoff;signal-to-noise ratio floor;size 45 nm;standard cell library;timing correctness;timing-error acceptance;video compression","","7","","10","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, only few delay faults are robustly testable. For robustly untestable faults, non-robust tests which are of lesser quality are typically generated. Due to significantly relaxed conditions, there is a large quality gap between non-robust and robust tests. This paper presents a test generation procedure for As-Robust-As-Possible (ARAP) tests to increase the overall quality of the test set. Instead of generating a non-robust test for a robustly untestable fault, an ARAP test is generated which maximizes the number of satisfiable conditions required for robust test generation by pseudo-Boolean optimization. Additionally, the problem formulation is extended to incorporate the increased significance of small delay defects. By this, the likeliness that small delay defects invalidate the test is reduced. Experimental results on large industrial circuits confirm the quality gap and show that the generated ARAP tests satisfy a large percentage of all robustness conditions on average which signifies a very high quality.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763207","","Circuit faults;Delay;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Optimization;Robustness;Testing","automatic test pattern generation;delays;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;optimisation","as-robust-as-possible test generation;delay faults;delay testing;pseudoBoolean optimization;robust test generation;small delay defect","","4","","23","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These defects initially manifest as small delay faults that may evolve in time and exceed the slack time in the clock cycle period. Periodic tests performed with reduced slack time provide a low-cost solution that allows to predict failures induced by slowly evolving delay faults. Unfortunately, such tests have limited fault coverage and fault detection latency. Here, we introduce a way to complement or completely replace the periodic testing with reduced slack time. Delay control structures are proposed to enable arbitrarily small parts of the monitored component to switch fast between a normal operating mode and a degraded mode characterized by a smaller slack time. Only two or three additional transistors are needed for each flip-flop in the monitored logic. Micro-architectural support for a concurrent self-test of pipelined logic that takes benefit of the introduced degraded mode is presented as well. Test stimuli are produced on the fly by the last two valid operations executed before each stall cycle. Test result evaluation is facilitated by the replication of the last valid operation during a stall cycle. Protection against transient faults can be achieved if each operation is replicated via stall cycle insertion.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763258","","Aging;Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Clocks;Delay;Flip-flops;Pipelines","CMOS logic circuits;flip-flops;logic testing","CMOS;aging mechanism;concurrent self-testing;delay control structure;delay fault;error prediction;failure prediction;fault coverage;fault detection latency;flip-flop;logic monitoring;microarchitectural support;periodic testing;pipelined logic;stall cycle insertion;transient fault;transistor","","2","","38","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we feed these counterexample traces to iteratively refine the original simulation trace data. We introduce an incremental decision tree to mine the new traces in each iteration. The algorithm converges when all the candidate assertions are true. We prove that our algorithm will always converge and capture the complete functionality of an output on convergence.

As in mobile applications energy efficiency is key, 3D integration is especially here a strategic technology. In this paper we focus on the design space exploration of 3D-stacked DRAMs with respect to performance, energy and area efficiency for densities from 256Mbit to 4Gbit per 3D-DRAM channel. We investigate four different technology nodes from 75nm down to 45nm and show the optimal design point for the currently most common commodity DRAM density of 1Gbit. Multiple channels can be combined for main memory sizes of up to 32GB. We present a functional SystemC model for the 3D-stacked DRAM which is coupled with a SDR/DDR 3D-DRAM channel controller. Parameters for this model were derived from detailed circuit level simulations. The exploration demonstrates that an optimized 1Gbit 3D-DRAM stack is 15× more energy efficient compared to a commodity Low-Power DDR SDRAM part without IO drivers and pads. To the best of our knowledge this is the first design space exploration for 3D-stacked DRAM considering different technologies and real world physical commodity DRAM data.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763068","","Integrated circuit modeling;Organizations;Random access memory;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias;Tiles;Wiring","DRAM chips;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D-stacked DRAM;TSV;circuit level simulations;design space exploration;functional SystemC model;memory interface;multiple memory layers;through silicon via technology","","10","2","16","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On testing prebond dies with incomplete clock networks in a 3D IC using DLLs","Buttrick, M.; Kundu, S.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

The manufacturing itself is based on wafer-to-wafer bonding, die-to-wafer bonding or die-to-die bonding. Wafer-to-wafer bonding has the lowest yield as a good die may be stacked against a bad die, resulting in a wasted good die. Thus the latter two options are preferred to keep yield high and manufacturing costs low. However, these methods require dies to be tested separately before they are stacked. A problem with testing dies separately is that the clock network of a prebond die may be incomplete before stacking. In this paper we present a solution to address this problem. The solution is based on on-die DLL implementations that are only activated during testing prebond unstacked dies to synchronize disconnected clock regions. A problem with using DLLs in testing is that they cannot be turned on or off within a single cycle. Since scan-based testing requires that test patterns be scanned in at a slow clock frequency before fast capture clocks are applied [1], on-product clock generation (OPCG) must be used. The proposed solution addresses the above problems. Furthermore, we show that a higher-speed DLL is better suited to not only high frequency system clocks, but lower power as well due to a smaller variable delay line.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763229","3D integrated circuit testing;delay lock loops;low power testing;on-product clock generation","Clocks;Delay;Delay lines;Phase locked loops;Synchronization;Testing;Three dimensional displays","delay lock loops;integrated circuit testing;microassembling;three-dimensional integrated circuits;wafer bonding","3D IC;3D integration;clock frequency;clock network;delay line;die-to-die bonding;die-to-wafer bonding;disconnected clock region;frequency system clock;higher-speed DLL;manufacturing cost;on-die DLL implementation;onproduct clock generation;prebond unstacked die testing;scan-based testing;silicon die;test pattern;wafer-to-wafer bonding","","4","","10","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose, for the first time, a high-temperature reconfigurable computing platform capable of operating at temperature of 500°C or higher. Such a platform is also amenable for reliable operation in high-radiation environment. The hardware reconfigurable platform follows the interleaved architecture of conventional Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and provides the usual benefits of lower design cost and time. However, high-temperature operation is enabled by choice of a special device material, namely silicon carbide (SiC), and a special switch structure, namely Nano-Electro-Mechanical-System (NEMS) switch. While SiC provides excellent mechanical and chemical properties suitable for operation at extreme harsh environment, NEMS switch provides low-voltage operation, ultra-low leakage and radiation hardness. We propose a novel multi-layer NEMS switch structure and efficient design of each building block of FPGA using nanoscale SiC NEMS switches. Using measured switch parameters from a number of SiC NEMS switches we fabricated, we compare the power, performance and area of an all-mechanical FPGA with alternative implementations for several benchmark circuits.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763175","FPGA;High Temperature Electronics;NEMS;SiC","Field programmable gate arrays;Logic gates;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Routing;Silicon carbide;Structural beams;Temperature sensors","field programmable gate arrays;nanoelectromechanical devices;semiconductor switches;silicon compounds;wide band gap semiconductors","FPGA;NEMS switch;SiC;field programmable gate array;hardware reconfigurable platform;high radiation environment;high temperature reconfigurable computing;interleaved architecture;nanoelectromechanical system switch","","0","","14","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, even using inward p-type access transistors, the 6T TFET SRAM achieves only the write or the read operation reliably, (ii) In order to improve the reliability of 6T TFET SRAMs, we perform the first study of four leading write-assist (WA) and four leading read-assist (RA) techniques in TFET SRAMs. We conclude that the 6T TFET SRAM with GND lowering RA is the most reliable 6T TFET SRAM during write and read, and we verify that it is also robust under process variations. It also achieves the best performance and reliability, as well as the least static power and area, in comparison to other existing TFET SRAM structures. Further, it not only has comparable performance and reliability to the 32nm 6T CMOS SRAM, but also consumes 6-7 orders of magnitude lower static power, making it attractive for low-power high-density SRAM applications.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763126","","CMOS integrated circuits;Delay;Integrated circuit reliability;Logic gates;Random access memory;Transistors;Tunneling","elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;random-access storage;silicon","6T TFET SRAM;SRAM cell;Si;inward p-type TFET;inward p-type access transistors;n-type access transistors;read operation;read-assist technique;reliability;robust 6T Si tunneling transistor SRAM design;tunneling field effect transistors;unidirectional conduction;write-assist technique","","3","","21","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, design cost and complexity constraints have recently caused the microprocessor industry to switch to multi-core architectures, even though these parallel machines present programming challenges that are far from solved. Moore's Law now translates into ever-more processors on a multi-, and soon many-core chip. The software challenge is compounded by the need for increasing fault-tolerance as near-atomic-scale variability and robustness problems bite harder. We look beyond this transitional phase to a future where the availability of processor resource is effectively unlimited and computations must be optimised for energy usage rather than load balancing, and we look to biology for examples of how such systems might work.

We present a FlexRay switch concept that is capable of increasing the effective bandwidth and improving the safety of existing FlexRay buses. A prototype FPGA implementation shows the feasibility of our approach. Further, a scheduling approach for the FlexRay switch that obtains the optimal results based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is presented. Since the ILP approach becomes intractable for real-world problems, we present a heuristic three-step approach that determines the branches of the network, performs a local scheduling for each node, and finally assembles the local schedules into a global schedule.

The proposed framework consists of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2 profile for TinyOS applications and a corresponding simulator. The UML profile allows for the description of the low-level details of the hardware simulator, thereby providing a higher level of abstraction for application developers to visually design, document and maintain their systems that consist of both hardware and software components. With the aid of a predefined component repository, minimum TinyOS knowledge is needed to construct a body sensor network system. A novel feature of our framework is that we have modeled not only software applications but the simulator platform in UML. A new instance of the simulator can be automatically generated whenever hardware changes are made. Key design issues, such as timing and energy consumption can be tested by simulating the generated software implementation on the automatically customized simulator. The framework ensures a separation of software and hardware development while maintaining a close connection between them. This paper describes the concepts and implementation of the proposed framework, and presents how the framework is used in the development of nesC-TinyOS based body sensor network applications. Two actual case studies are used to show how the proposed framework can quickly and automatically adapt the software implementation to efficiently accommodate hardware changes.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763321","","Body sensor networks;Generators;Hardware;Software;Timing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;body sensor networks;hardware-software codesign;operating systems (computers);power aware computing","TinyOS applications;UML 2-based hardware-software co-design;body sensor network applications;component repository;energy consumption;hardware simulator;modularity;nesC-TinyOS;reusability","","0","","15","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to older SiO<sub>2</sub> or SiON based technologies, transistor reliability is found to be worse in high-k nodes due to larger oxide electric fields, the severely aggravated PBTI effect and increased time-dependent variability. Conventional reliability margins, based on accelerated stress measurements on individual transistors, are no longer sufficient nor adequate for analog circuit design.

However, the state-of-the-art methods either have good efficiency but highly depend on the accuracy of the equivalent circuit models, which may fail the synthesis when the frequency is high; or fully depend on electromagnetic (EM) simulations, whose solution quality is high but are too expensive. To address the problem, a new method, called Gaussian Process-Based Differential Evolution for Constrained Optimization (GPDECO) is proposed. In particular, GPDECO performs global optimization of the microwave structure using EM simulations, and a Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model is constructed ON-LINE at the same time to predict the results of expensive EM simulations. GPDECO is tested by two 60GHz transformers and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods are performed. The results show that GPDECO can generate high performance RF passive components that cannot be generated by the available efficient methods. Compared with available methods with the best solution quality, GPDECO can achieve comparable results but only costs 20%-25% of the computational effort. Using parallel computation in an 8-core CPU, the synthesis can be finished in less than 0.5 hour.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763181","Differential evolution;Gaussian process;Microwave components;Microwave design;Surrogate model;Transformer synthesis","Accuracy;Data models;Integrated circuit modeling;Microwave circuits;Optimization;Predictive models","Gaussian processes;equivalent circuits;microwave integrated circuits;optimisation;passive networks;transformers","GPDECO;Gaussian process;RF passive components;RFIC designers;constrained optimization;differential evolution;electromagnetic simulations;equivalent circuit models;global optimization;high frequency microwave circuits;integrated transformers;microwave passive components;surrogate model","","4","","18","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It attains better slew and much smaller latency with comparable clock skew and less area when compared to type-matching. The skew of a delay-matching gated tree, just like the one generated by type-matching, is insensitive to process and operating corner variations.

Test compaction has been a de-facto design-for-testability technique to reduce the test cost. However, the compacted test responses make multiple-fault diagnosis rather difficult. When there is no space compactor, the most likely suspect fault is considered producing the failing responses most similar to the failing responses observed from the automatic test equipment. But when compactor exists, those suspect faults may no longer have the same high possibility of being the actual faults. To address this problem, we introduce a novel metric explanation necessity. By using both of the new metric and the traditional metric explanation capability, we evaluate the possibility of a suspect fault to be the actual fault.

More precisely, we use the delay Probability Density Function (PDF) of the CIs in identification and selection phases of the CI extension. In the identification phase, the delay of each CI is modeled by PDF whereas the performance yield is added as a constraint. Additionally, in the selection phase, the merit function of the conventional approaches is modified to increase the performance gain of the selected CIs at the price of slightly sacrificing the design yield.

In a bioassay, reducing the waste is crucial because the waste droplet handling is cumbersome and the number of waste reservoirs on-chip needs to be minimized to use limited volume of sample and expensive reagents and hence to reduce the cost of a biochip. The existing dilution algorithms attempt to reduce the number of mix/split steps required in the process but focus little on minimization of sample requirement or waste droplets. In this work, we characterize the underlying combinatorial properties of waste generation and identify the inherent limitations of two earlier mixing algorithms (BS algorithm by Thies et al., Natural Computing 2008; DMRW algorithm by Roy et al., IEEE TCAD 2010) in addressing this issue. Based on these properties, we design an improved dilution/mixing algorithm (IDMA) that optimizes the usage of intermediate droplets generated during the dilution process, which in turn, reduces the demand of sample/reagent and production of waste. The algorithm terminates in O(n) steps for producing a target CF with a precision of 1/2<sup>n</sup>. Based on simulation results for all CF values ranging from 1/1024 to 1023/1024 using a sample (100% concentration) and a buffer solution (0% concentration), we present an integrated scheme of choosing the best waste-aware dilution algorithm among BS, DMRW, and IDMA for any given value of CF.

These organic devices however, are still reliant on the support functions of standard silicon components such as power and logic transistors. Integration of these organic devices with standard silicon electronics into a combined heterogeneous system requires specific design and fabrication considerations. Full-scale integration with conventional silicon based electronic components is challenging due to their incompatibility with common semiconductor fabrication process that can damage the active organic compounds. The printable/spray/spin nature of organic electronics fabrication makes 3D integration an attractive methodology. We propose to combine the organic and inorganic portions of a heterogeneous system by fabricating the modules separately (hence enabling parallel manufacturing) in a specific 2D layout scheme, and subsequently connecting the devices together in a post fabrication process. In this paper we discuss the 2D designs in detail and propose a 2D-3D hybrid design as well as a fully 3D stacked design for organic electronics with energy storage devices in a face-to-back configuration.

In this paper, we show that DVFS scaled circuits substantially lag in energy efficiency, by 22-86%, compared to ground up designs for target frequency levels. We propose Topologically Homogeneous Power-Performance Heterogeneous multicore systems (THPH), a fundamentally alternate means to design energy efficient multicore systems.

While the proposed exact approach requires a significant amount of run-time (exponential in the worst case), the heuristic methods lead to very precise approximations in very short run-time.

However, its application is practically limited due to the difficulties in reliably implementing a large set of arbitrary dedicated clock delays for the flip-flops. Multi-domain clock skew scheduling was proposed to tackle this impracticality by constraining the total number of clock delays. Even though this problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP), it is expensive to solve optimally in general. In this paper, we show that, under mild restrictions, the underlying domain assignment problem can be formulated as a special MILP that can be solved effectively using similar techniques for the MCR problem. In particular, we design a generalized Howard's algorithm for solving this problem efficiently. We also develop a critical-cycle-oriented refinement algorithm to further improve the results. The experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmarks show both the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm.

We implement two hash candidates, Keccak and SIMD, in various configurations of multi-core hardware and multi-core software. Next, we vary application parameters such as message length, message multiplicity, and message source.

A voltage emergency occurs when supply voltage variation exceeds the acceptable voltage margin, jeopardizing the microprocessor reliability. Existing techniques assume all voltage emergencies would definitely lead to incorrect program execution and prudently activate rollbacks or flushes to recover, and consequently incur high performance overhead. We observe that not all voltage emergencies result in external visible errors, which can be exploited to avoid unnecessary protection. In this paper, we propose a substantial-impact-filter based method to tolerate voltage emergencies, including three key techniques: 1) Analyze the architecture-level masking of voltage emergencies during program execution; 2) Propose a metric intermittent vulnerability factor for intermittent timing faults (IV F<sub>itf</sub>) to quantitatively estimate the vulnerability of microprocessor structures (load/store queue and register file) to voltage emergencies; 3) Propose a substantial-impact-filter based method to handle voltage emergencies.

Since reset is typically not timing critical, it is handled at late physical design stages. However, the large fanout of reset and the lack of routing resources at these stages can create variant delays on different targets of the reset signal, creating reset recovery problems. Traditional approaches address this problem using physical design methods such as buffer insertion or rerouting. However, these methods may invalidate previous optimization efforts, making timing closure difficult.

Aggressive technology scaling trends, such as thinner gate oxide without proportional down-scaling of supply voltage, necessitate an aging-aware analysis and optimization flow during early design stages. Since only a small portion of critical and near-critical paths can be sensitized and may determine the circuit delay under aging, path sensitization should also be explicitly addressed for more accurate and efficient optimization. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of path sensitization on aging-aware timing analysis and then present a novel framework for aging-aware timing optimization considering path sensitization. By extracting and manipulating critical sub-circuits accounting for the effective circuit delay, our proposed framework can reduce aging-induced performance degradation to only 1.21% or one-seventh of the original performance loss with less than 2% area overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763249","","Aging;Automatic test pattern generation;Delay;Logic gates;Optimization;Transistors","ageing;circuit optimisation;circuit reliability;integrated circuit design;nanoelectronics;timing circuits","aggressive technology;aging-aware timing analysis;aging-aware timing optimization;circuit delay;circuit lifetime;circuit performance;critical subcircuit;device aging;nanoscale design;optimization flow;path sensitization;reliability degradation;supply voltage","","3","","19","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method partitions the entire simulation run into simulation slices in temporal domain and each slice is simulated separately. With each slice being independent from each other, an almost linear speedup is achievable with a large number of simulation nodes.

This paper proposes a heterogeneous main memory with three different memory modules, where each module is heavily optimized for one the three parameters at the cost of compromising the other two. Based on the memory access characteristics of an application, the operating system allocates its pages in a memory module that satisfies its memory requirements.

This is particularly interesting for streaming applications, which transfer huge amount of data between the same source-destination pairs. The proposed routing algorithm is able to route messages in the presence of any set of multiple nodes and links failures, as long as a path exists, and does not use any routing table. It is scalable and can be applied to multicore chips with a 2D mesh core interconnect of any size. The algorithm is deadlock-free and avoids infinite looping in fault-free and faulty 2D meshes. We simulated the proposed algorithm using the worst case scenario, with different failure rates. Experimentation results confirmed that the algorithm tolerates multiple failures even in the most extreme failure patterns. Additionally, we monitored the interconnect traffic and average latency for faulty cases.

In practice, the transformation sequences is encoded in synthesis scripts which are derived manually based on experience and intuition of the tool developer. These scripts are static in the sense that transformations are applied independently of the result of previous transformations or the current status of the design. Despite the importance of obtaining high quality scripts, there are only a few attempts to optimize them. In this paper, we present a novel method to select transformations dynamically during the synthesis run leveraging the theory of Markov Decision Processes.

Despite its global view, the size of the MinCostFlow instance is only linear in the number of partitioning regions and does not depend on the number of cells. We prove that our partitioning scheme finds a (fractional) solution for any given placement or decides in polynomial time that none exists.

In this paper we present a novel methodology for incremental interconnect customization of CGRAs that can suggest a new interconnection architecture that can maximize the performance for a given set of application kernels while minimizing the hardware cost. Applying the inexact graph matching analogy, we translate our problem into graph matching taking into account the cost of various graph edit operations, which we solve using the A* search algorithm with a heuristic tailored to our problem.

Two algorithms - ranking-based and complexity-factor-based - for reliability-driven DC assignment are proposed in this paper. Both algorithms use Hamming distance metrics to determine 0/1 assignments for the most critical DC terms, thereby leaving flexibility in the circuit specification for subsequent optimization. Since ranking-based DC assignment offers less control over overhead, we develop a complexity-factor-based DC assignment algorithm that can achieve up to 21.4% improvement in error rate with a simultaneous 4.3% reduction in area over conventional DC assignment.

In order to resolve the problem, we propose balancing the budget of DRAM row activation across DRAM channels. In the proposed method, an inter-memory controller coordinator receives the current demand of row activation from memory controllers and re-distributes the budget to the memory controllers in order to improve DRAM performance. Experimental results show that sharing the budget of row activation between memory channels can give average 4.72% improvement in the utilization of 3D stacked DRAM.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763214","","Bandwidth;Benchmark testing;Delay;Memory management;Random access memory;Stacking;Three dimensional displays","DRAM chips;embedded systems;system-on-chip","3D die stacking;3D stacked DRAM;active bank window;current demand;embedded system-on-chip;intermemory controller coordinator;memory controllers;mobile system-on-chip;row-to-row activation delay;tFAW;tRRD","","0","","26","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, power dissipation in CMPs can be high if numerous cores are simultaneously active. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is widely used to reduce the active power, but its effectiveness and cost depends on the granularity at which it is applied. Per-core DVFS allows the greatest flexibility in controlling power, but incurs the expense of an unrealistically large number of on-chip voltage regulators. Per-chip DVFS, where all cores are controlled by a single regulator overcomes this problem at the expense of greatly reduced flexibility. This work considers the problem of building an intermediate solution, clustering the cores of a multicore processor into DVFS domains and implementing DVFS on a per-cluster basis. Based on a typical workload, we propose a scheme to find similarity among the cores and cluster them based on this similarity. We also provide an algorithm to implement DVFS for the clusters, and evaluate the effectiveness of per-cluster DVFS in power reduction.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763052","","Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Multicore processing;Program processors;Regulators;Schedules;System-on-a-chip","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;voltage regulators","DVFS;active power;chip multiprocessor;dynamic voltage;frequency scaling;granularity;high-speed computing demand;multicore processor;on-chip voltage regulator;power management;power reduction","","13","","12","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although these new technologies have desirable energy and scalability properties, they are prone to wear-out due to excessive write operations. Because wear-out is an important phenomenon, a number of endurance management schemes have been proposed. There is a trade-off between what techniques to use, depending on the range of bit cell lifetime within a device. This range in cell durability arises from effects due to process variation. In this paper, we describe modeling techniques to analyze trade-offs for endurance management based on the anticipated distribution of cell lifetime. This analysis considers two general endurance strategies (physical capacity degradation and physical sparing) under four distributions of cell lifetime (constant, linear, normal, and bimodal). The modeling techniques can be used to determine how much redundancy is needed when a sparing endurance strategy is adopted. With the correct choice of technique, the device lifetime can be doubled.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763156","","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Approximation methods;Equations;Mathematical model;Phase change materials;Random access memory","durability;flash memories;phase change memories;redundancy;storage management;wear;write-once storage","anticipated distribution;bit cell lifetime;cell durability;device lifetime;endurance algorithms;endurance management schemes;flash memory;memory technology;modeling techniques;nonvolatile memory;phase-change memory;physical capacity degradation;physical sparing;process variation;redundancy;scalability property;sparing endurance strategy;storage technology;wear-out;wear-prone memory;write operations","","1","","11","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, such applications have been realized on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and/or digital signal processors (DSP). However, ASICs' advantage in performance and power often could not justify the fast increasing fabrication cost, while current DSP offers a limited processing throughput that is usually lower than 100GFLOPS. On the other hand, current multi-core processors, especially graphics processing units (GPUs), deliver very high computing throughput, and at the same time maintain high flexibility and programmability. It is thus appealing to study the potential of GPUs for high performance embedded computing. In this work, we perform a comprehensive performance evaluation on GPUs with the high performance embedded computing (HPEC) benchmark suite, which consist a broad range of signal processing benchmarks with an emphasis on radar processing applications. We develop efficient GPU implementations that could outperform previous results for all the benchmarks.

"Diagnosing scan chain timing faults through statistical feature analysis of scan images","Mingjing Chen; Orailoglu, A.","CSE Dept., UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2011","20110505","2011","","","1","6","Excessive test mode power-ground noise in nanometer scale chips causes large delay uncertainties in scan chains, resulting in a highly elevated rate of timing failures. The hybrid timing violation types in scan chains, plus their possibly intermittent manifestations, invalidate the traditional assumptions in scan chain fault behavior, significantly increasing the ambiguity and difficulty in diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to resolve the challenge of diagnosing multiple permanent or intermittent timing faults in scan chains. Instead of relying on fault simulation that is incapable of approximating the intermittent fault manifestation, the proposed technique characterizes the impact of timing faults by analyzing the phase movement of scan patterns. Extracting fault-sensitive statistical features of phase movement information provides strong signals for the precise identification of fault locations and types. The manifestation probability of each fault is furthermore computed through a mathematical transformation framework which accurately models the behavior of multiple faults as a Markov chain. The fault model utilized in the proposed scheme considers the effect of possibly asymmetric fault manifestation, thus maximally approximating the realistic failure behavior. Simulations on large benchmark circuits and two industrial designs have confirmed that the proposed methodology can yield highly accurate diagnosis results even for complicated fault manifestations such as multiple intermittent faults with mixed fault types.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763040","","Circuit faults;Correlation;Fault location;Image segmentation;Mathematical model;Timing","Markov processes;design for testability;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;nanoelectronics;probability;statistical analysis;timing","Markov chain;asymmetric fault manifestation;benchmark circuit;design for testability;fault-sensitive statistical feature extraction;hybrid timing violation type;industrial design;intermittent timing fault diagnosis;manifestation probability;mathematical transformation framework;nanometer scale chip;permanent timing fault diagnosis;phase movement analysis;scan chain timing fault diagnosis;statistical feature analysis;test mode power-ground noise;timing failure","","0","1","16","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach supports the developer to increase the fault tolerance of the system during the design phase. It is a heuristic, which, additionally to a determined initial configuration, calculates possible reconfigurations for the remaining nodes of the FlexRay network in case of a node failure, to keep the system working properly. An evaluation by means of realistic safety-critical automotive real-time systems revealed that it determines valid reconfigurations for up to 80% of possible individual node failures.

Such business practices make the designs vulnerable to hard-to-detect malicious modifications by an adversary, termed as “Hardware Trojans”. In this paper, we show that malicious nexus between multiple parties at different stages of the design, manufacturing and deployment makes the attacks on cryptographic hardware more potent. We describe the general model of such an attack, which we refer to as Multi-level Attack, and provide an example of it on the hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, where a hardware Trojan is embedded in the design. We then analytically show that the resultant attack poses a significantly stronger threat than that from a Trojan attack by a single adversary.

This event, called power droop, usually manifests itself in at-speed scan test where a surge in switching activity (capture phase) follows a period of quiescent circuit state (shift phase). Power droop is also present during mission mode operation. However, because of the less predictable occurrence of the switching events in mission mode, usually the values of power droop measured during test are different from those measured in mission mode. To overcome the power droop problem, different mitigation techniques have been proposed. The goal of these techniques is to create a uniform current demand throughout the test. This paper proposes a feedback based droop mitigation technique which can adapt to the droop by reading the level of VDD and modifying real time the current flowing on ad-hoc droop mitigators. It is shown that the proposed solution not only can compensate for droop events occurring during test mode but also can be used as a method of mission mode droop mitigation and yield enhancement if higher power consumption is acceptable.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763296","ATPG;droop;mitigation techniques;power supply","Registers","VLSI;feedback;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;transients","VLSI circuit;at-speed scan test;feedback based droop mitigation;logic malfunctioning;mission mode operation;power droop;quiescent circuit state;shift phase;temporary voltage drop;uniform current demand","","0","","11","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous work in 3D power delivery network design has simply extended 2D techniques by treating through-silicon vias (TSVs) as extensions of the C4 bumps. By exploiting the smaller size and much higher interconnect density possible with TSVs we demonstrate significant reduction of nearly 50% in the IR-drop of our 3D design. Simulations also show that a 3-tier stack with the distributed TSV topology actually lowers IR-drop by 20% over a non-3D system with less power dissipation. Finally, we analyze the power distribution network of an envisioned 1000-core processor with 30 stacked dies and show scaling trends related to both increased stacking and power distribution TSVs.

In order to represent the distributions of timing information such as a gate delay, a signal arrival time, and a slack, various techniques have been proposed. Among them, Gaussian mixture model is distinguished from the others in that it can handle any correlation, non-Gaussian distributions, and slew distributions easily. However, the previous method of computing the statistical maximum for Gaussian mixture models has a defect such that it produces a distribution similar to Gaussian in a certain case, although the correct distribution is far from Gaussian. In this paper, we propose a novel method for statistical maximum (minimum) operation for Gaussian mixture models. It takes cumulative distribution function curve into consideration so as to compute accurate criticalities (probabilities of timing violation), which is important for detecting delay faults and circuit optimization. The proposed method reduces the error of criticality almost 80% from the previous method.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763327","Gaussian mixture model;criticality;cumulative distribution curve;probability of timing violation;statistical static timing analysis","Correlation;Delay;Delta modulation;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Joints","Gaussian distribution;circuit optimisation;circuit testing;statistical analysis","Gaussian mixture model;circuit optimization;cumulative distribution function curve;delay fault detection;nonGaussian distribution;process variability;slew distribution;statistical delay fault testing;statistical design approach;statistical maximum operation;statistical minimum operation;statistical static timing analysis;timing violation probability","","0","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works in escape routing are not likely to be used due to this nature, in this work, we describe this fixed ordering boundary pin escaping problem, and propose a practical approach to solve it. Not only can we have a way to address, we also further plan the wires in a better way to preserve the precious routing resources in the limited number of layers on the board, and to effectively deal with obstacles. Our approach has different feature compared with conventional shortest-path-based routing paradigm. In addition, we consider length-matching requirement and wire shape resemblance for high speed signal routes on board.

The static timing analysis (STA) considering on-chip power supply variations (IR-drop) is therefore one of the most crucial issues in the LSI designs nowadays. We propose an efficient STA method to consider on-chip power supply variations in the static timing analysis by utilizing the spatial correlations of IR-drop. The proposed method is based on the widely-used technique in STA considering OCV (on-chip variations), which is called LOCV (Location-based OCV) technique, and therefore our method is easy to be incorporated into the existing timing analysis flow. The proposed method is evaluated by using test data including H-tree clock structure with various on-chip IR-drop distributions. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the design margin with respect to power supply variations by 6-85% (47% on the average) compared with the conventional practical approach with a constant OCV derating factor, while requiring no additional computation cost in the static timing analysis.

The heart of STABLE is a computer-algebra-based engine which provides algorithms for simplifying arithmetic problems of an SMT instance prior to bit-blasting. As the primary application domain for STABLE we target an SMT-based property checking flow for System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. When verifying industrial data path modules we frequently encounter custom-designed arithmetic components specified at the logic level of the hardware description language being used. This results in SMT problems where arithmetic parts may include non-arithmetic constraints. STABLE includes a new technique for extracting arithmetic bit-level information for these non-arithmetic constraints. Thus, our algebraic engine can solve subproblems related to the entire arithmetic design component. STABLE was successfully evaluated in comparison with other state-of-the-art SMT solvers on a large collection of SMT formulas describing verification problems of industrial data path designs that include multiplication. In contrast to the other solvers STABLE was able to solve instances with bit-widths of up to 64 bits.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763035","","Adders;Algebra;Engines;Mathematical model;Polynomials;System-on-a-chip","Boolean algebra;formal verification;system-on-chip","Boolean reasoning;SMT-based property checking flow;SoC;arithmetic bit-level information;arithmetic problems;bit-blasting;computer algebra;computer-algebra-based engine;fixed-sized bit vectors;hard verification problems;industrial data path modules;quantifier-free logic;system-on-chip designs","","6","","25","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System resources, such as memories, are shared between applications to reduce cost, causing their timing behavior to become inter-dependent. Using conventional simulation-based verification, this requires all concurrently executing applications to be verified together, resulting in a rapidly increasing verification complexity. Predictable and composable systems have been proposed to address this problem. Predictable systems provide bounds on performance, enabling formal analysis to be used as an alternative to simulation. Composable systems isolate applications, enabling them to be verified independently. Predictable and composable systems are built from predictable and composable resources. This paper presents three general techniques to implement and model predictable and composable resources, and demonstrates their applicability in the context of a memory controller. The architecture of the memory controller is general and supports both SRAM and DDR2/DDR3 SDRAM and a wide range of arbiters, making it suitable for many predictable and composable systems. The modeling approach is based on a shared-resource abstraction that covers any combination of supported memory and arbiter and enables system-level performance analysis with a variety of well-known frameworks, such as network calculus or data-flow analysis.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763145","SDRAM;arbitration;composability;latency-rate servers;memory controller;memory patterns;predictability;real-time","Bandwidth;Delay;Interference;Memory management;Predictive models;SDRAM","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;circuit complexity;memory architecture;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;shared memory systems;system-on-chip","DDR2-DDR3 SDRAM;SRAM;formal analysis;multiprocessor system-on-chip design;predictable memory controller architecture;shared resource abstraction;simulation-based verification;system integration;system-level performance analysis;verification complexity","","17","","52","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that accurate variation-aware system-level performance analysis requires repeated system execution, which is prohibitively slow when based on simulation. Emulation is a widely-used approach to drastically speedup system-level simulation, but it has not been hitherto applied to variation analysis. We describe a framework - Variability Emulation for SoC Performance Analysis (VESPA) - that adapts and applies emulation to the problem of variation aware SoC performance analysis. The proposed framework consists of three phases: component variability characterization, variation-aware emulation setup, and Monte-carlo driven emulation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework by applying it to design variation-aware architectures for two example SoCs - an 802.11 MAC processor and an MPEG encoder.

This paper describes a new method for automatically building efficient and accurate predictive models for a wide range of system-level performance metrics. These models can be used to eliminate or reduce the need for simulation during design space exploration. We evaluate our method by building a model for the lifetime of networks containing up to 120 nodes, considering both fault processes and battery energy depletion. With our adaptive sampling technique, only 0.27% of the potential solutions are evaluated via simulation. Notably, one such automatically produced model outperforms the most advanced manually designed analytical model, reducing error by 13% while maintaining very low model evaluation overhead.

The existing SCI approaches realize the back-annotation of timing information based on mapping between source code and binary code. However, optimizing compilation has a large impact on the code mapping and will lower the accuracy of the generated source-level TLMs. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to tackle this problem.

A power converter is a key component in micro-scale energy harvesting systems. Various design parameters of the power converter, most notably the number of stages in a multi-stage power converter, play a crucial role in determining the amount of electrical power that can be extracted from a micro-scale energy transducer such as a miniature solar cell. Existing stage number optimization techniques for switched capacitor power converters, when used for energy harvesting systems, result in a substantial degradation in the amount of harvested electrical power. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new stage number optimization technique for switched capacitor power converters that maximizes the net harvested power in micro-scale energy harvesting systems. The proposed technique is based on a new figure-of-merit that is well suited for energy-harvesting systems. We have validated the proposed technique through circuit simulations using IBM 65nm technology.

This is a way to design energy-aware or power-efficient systems, where energy is considered as a resource whose utilization must be optimized in the realm of performance constraints. Increasingly, energy and power turn from optimization criteria into constraints, sometimes as critical as, for example, reliability and timing. Furthermore, quanta of energy or specific levels of power can shape the system's action. In other words, the system's behavior, i.e. the way how computation and communication is carried out, can be determined or modulated by the flow of energy into the system. This view becomes dominant when energy is harvested from the environment. In this paper, we attempt to pave the way to a systematic approach to designing computing systems that are energy-modulated. To this end, several design examples are considered where power comes from energy harvesting sources with limited power density and unstable levels of power.

To relieve this growing burden, assertion-based verification has gained popularity as a means to increase the quality and efficiency of verification. Although robust, the adoption of assertion-based verification poses new challenges to debugging due to presence of errors in the assertions. These unique challenges necessitate a departure from past automated circuit debugging techniques which are shown to be ineffective. In this work, we present a methodology, mutation model and additional techniques to debug errors in SystemVerilog assertions. The methodology uses the failing assertion, counterexample and mutation model to produce alternative properties that are verified against the design.

In spite of efficient utilization of communication bandwidth (BW), event-triggered protocols suffer from unpredictable temporal behavior, which is exactly the opposite in the case of their time-triggered counterparts. In the context of communication delays experienced by the control-related messages exchanged over the shared communication bus, we observe that a distributed control application is more prone to performance deterioration in transient phases compared to in the steady-state. We exploit this observation to re-engineer control applications to operate in two modes, in order to optimally exploit the bi-modal (time- and event-triggered) characteristics of the underlying communication medium. Depending on the state (transient or steady) of the system, both, the control inputs and the communication schedule are now switched. Using a FlexRay-based case study, we show that such a design provides a good trade-off between control performance and bus utilization.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763148","","Variable speed drives","protocols;scheduling;telecommunication control","FlexRay;automotive communication systems;bi-modal characteristics;communication bandwidth;control-related messages;cyber-physical architecture;distributed control application;event- triggered communication schedules;hybrid communication protocols;re-engineering cyber-physical control applications;time-triggered communication schedules","","3","","11","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these applications have drastically different precision and on-chip memory requirements. Moreover, DSPs often employ aggressive dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques to minimize power consumption. However, at reduced voltages, process variations can significantly increase the failure rate of on-chip SRAMs designed with small transistors to achieve high integration density, resulting in low yields. Consequently, the size of transistors in SRAM cells and cell size needs to be increased to satisfy the target yield. However, this can result in high area overhead since on-chip memories consume a significant portion of the die area. In this paper, we present a scratchpad memory design that exploits the tradeoffs between SRAM cell sizes, their failure rates, the minimum operating voltage for target yield (V<sub>ddmin</sub>), and application characteristics to achieve an on-chip memory area reduction of up to 17%. Our approach reduces V<sub>ddmin</sub>, which allows dynamic and leakage power savings of 42% and 36% respectively with DVFS. Moreover, for error-tolerant DSP applications we allow voltage scaling below V<sub>ddmin</sub> to achieve further power savings while incurring lower mean error as compared to short word-length memory. Finally, for error-sensitive applications, we propose a reconfigurable memory organization that trades memory capacity for higher precision at a lower V<sub>ddmin</sub>.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763158","","Digital signal processing;Finite impulse response filter;Memory management;Organizations;Random access memory;System-on-a-chip;Transistors","SRAM chips;digital signal processing chips","DVFS technique;SRAM cell size;aggressive dynamic voltage scaling;digital signal processing;dynamic frequency scaling;dynamic power savings;error-tolerant DSP application;failure rate;leakage power savings;on-chip SRAM;on-chip memory area reduction;power consumption;scratchpad memory optimization;transistor","","3","","15","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose is to create smaller loops (K-sub-loops) that have more speedup potential when parallelized. Making use of partial reconfigurability, the K-sub-loops can take advantage of having more area available for multiple kernel instances to execute in parallel on the FPGA. In order to study the potential for performance improvement of using the loop distribution on K-loops, we make use of a suite of randomly generated test cases. The results show an improvement of more than 40% over previously proposed methods in more than 60% of the cases. The algorithm is also validated with a K-loop extracted from the MJPEG application.

The main problems are the increased static power and reduced operating margins, robustness and reliability. A common way to reduce the static power consumption of an SRAM memory array is to decrease its supply voltage when in memory retention mode. However, this leads to a further reduction in memory robustness. The most common tool for statistical analysis of circuits under process variability is standard Monte Carlo simulation which has been proven to be too expensive when applied on an ultra dense SRAM. In this paper a statistical robustness analysis method is proposed based on decoupling statistical integration from robustness region determination in the parameter domain.

When detouring routes via this procedure, overflow is not increased, and the increase in wirelength is bounded. The power saving opportunities include: 1) reducing the area capacitance of the routes by detouring from the higher metal layers to the lower ones, 2) reducing the coupling capacitance between adjacent routes by distributing the congestion, and 3) considering different power-weights for each segment of a routed net with level converters (to capture its corresponding supply voltage and activity factor).

Still, their hardware implementations do not offer good performance in terms of frames that can be processed per time unit, mainly because of the complex dependency scheme among the data.

While modular SoC design provides power savings and simplifies the development process, it also leaves significant room for a special type of hardware bugs, interaction errors, to slip through pre- and post-silicon verification. Consequently, hard to fix silicon escapes may be discovered late in production schedule or even after a market release, potentially causing costly delays or recalls. In this work we propose a unified error detection and recovery framework that incorporates programmable features into the on-die fabric of an SoC, so triggers of escaped interaction bugs can be detected at runtime. Furthermore, upon detection, our solution locks the interface of an IP for a programmed time period, thus altering interactions between accesses and bypassing the bug in a manner transparent to software. For classes of errors that cannot be circumvented by this in-hardware technique our framework is programmed to propagate the error detection to the software layer. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of detecting a range of interaction errors with less than 0.01% performance penalty and 0.45% area overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763054","","Computer bugs;Detectors;Fabrics;Hardware;IP networks;Software;System-on-a-chip","reliability;system-on-chip","SoC survivability;distributed hardware matcher framework;functional IP blocks;general purpose processor cores;on-die fabric;systems on chip","","1","","16","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed method, a forest of steiner trees is first created which connects the registers so as to achieve zero skew and greedily balance the total capacitance of each tree. Then, a balanced assignment of the steiner trees to the tapping points is performed to guarantee a balanced capacitive load on the rotary network. The proposed routing method is tested with the ISPD clock network contest and IBM r1-r5 benchmarks. The experimental results show that the capacitive load imbalance is very limited. The total wirelength is reduced by 64.2% compared to the best previous work known in literature through the combination of steiner tree routing and the assignment of trees to the tapping points.

To optimise harvesting efficiency, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are often used. Recently-reported techniques focus solely on outdoor applications, being too power-hungry for use under indoor lighting. Additionally, some techniques have required light sensors (or pilot cells) to control their operating point. This paper describes an ultra low-power MPPT technique which is based on a novel system design and sample-and-hold arrangement, which enables MPPT across the range of light intensities found indoors and outdoors and is capable of cold-starting. The proposed sample-and-hold based technique has been validated through a prototype system. Its performance compares favourably against state-of-the-art systems, and does not require an additional pilot cell or photodiode. This represents an important contribution, in particular for sensors which may be exposed to different types of lighting (such as body-worn or mobile sensors).","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763302","","Ad hoc networks;Energy harvesting;Photovoltaic systems;Switching converters;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","lighting;low-power electronics;optical sensors;photodiodes;photovoltaic power systems;wireless sensor networks","cold-starting;indoor lighting;indoor wireless sensor nodes;light sensors;maximum power point tracking techniques;outdoor wireless sensor nodes;photodiode;photovoltaic energy harvesting;pilot cells;power wireless sensor nodes;sample-and-hold based technique;ultra low-power MPPT technique;ultra low-power photovoltaic MPPT technique","","3","","12","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thermal through-silicon vias (TTSVs) are considered an effective means to reduce the temperature of 3-D ICs. The effect of the physical and technological parameters of TTSVs on the heat transfer process within 3-D ICs is investigated. Two resistive networks are utilized to model the physical behavior of TTSVs. Based on these models, closed-form expressions are provided describing the flow of heat through TTSVs within a 3-D IC. The accuracy of these models is compared with results from a commercial FEM tool. For an investigated three-plane circuit, the average error of the first and second models is 2% and 4%, respectively. The effect of the physical parameters of TTSVs on the resulting temperature is described through the proposed models. For example, the temperature changes non-monotonically with the thickness of the silicon substrate. This behavior is not described by the traditional single thermal resistance model. The proposed models are used for the thermal analysis of a 3-D DRAM-μP system where the conventional model is shown to considerably overestimate the temperature of the system.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763069","3-D ICs;Thermal through-silicon via (TTSV);heat conductivity;thermal resistance","Finite element methods;Heat transfer;Integrated circuit modeling;Silicon;Substrates;Thermal resistance","heat transfer;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D integrated circuits;analytical heat transfer model;closed-form expressions;heat transfer process;thermal through-silicon vias;three-plane circuit","","7","","15","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Transaction-level Modeling (TLM) is a widely used technique for designing such virtual prototypes. In particular, they allow for early development of embedded software. The SystemC modeling language is the current industry standard for developing virtual prototypes. Our experience suggests that writing TLM models exclusively in SystemC leads sometimes to confusion between modeling concepts and their implementation, and may be the root of some known bad practices. This paper introduces jTLM, an experimentation framework that allow us to study the extent to which common modeling issues come from a more fundamental constraint of the TLM approach. We focus on a discussion of the two modes of simulation scheduling: cooperative and preemptive.

It is now widely recognized that the Hamiltonian eigensolution is a very reliable technique for such characterization. However, most available algorithms for the determination of the required Hamiltonian eigenvalues still require excessive comoputational resources for large-size macromodels with thousands of states. This work intends to break this complexity by introducing the first parallel implementation of a specialized Hamiltonian eigensolver, designed and optimized for shared memory multicore architectures. Our starting point is a multi-shift restarted and deflated Arnoldi process. Excellent parallel efficiency is obtained by running different Arnoldi iterations concurrently on different threads. The numerical results show that macromodels with several thousands states are characterized in few seconds on a 16-core machine, with close to ideal speedup factors.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763011","","Bandwidth;Convergence;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Frequency measurement;Indexes;Instruction sets;Vectors","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;shared memory systems","Arnoldi process;Hamiltonian eigenvalue;large interconnect macromodel;linear interconnect macromodel;parallel Hamiltonian eigensolver;passivity characterization;shared memory multicore architecture","","3","","25","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to minimize the average number of wire transitions per communication (a metric for dynamic power), while maintaining good coding efficiency. Basic implementations of the key supporting hardware blocks (encoder, completion detector, decoder) for the DI bus-invert codes are also presented. Each design was synthesized using the UC Berkeley ABC tool and technology mapped to a 90nm industrial standard cell library. When compared to the most coding-efficient systematic DIcode (i.e. Berger) over a range of field sizes from 2 to 14 bits, the DI bus-invert codes had 24.6 to 42.9% fewer wire transitions per transaction, while providing comparable coding efficiency.

A limit of the SIMD width of these types of architectures is the scalability of the interconnect network between the processing elements in terms of both area and power. To mitigate this problem, we propose the use of a new interconnect topology, XRAM, which is a low power high performance matrix style crossbar. It re-uses output buses for control programming, and stores multiple swizzle configurations at the cross points using SRAM cells, significantly reducing routing congestion and control signaling. We show that compared to conventionally implemented crossbars, the area scales with the product of inputx output ports while consuming almost 50% less energy.

We describe a system that makes it unnecessary for sensor network application developers and users to understand the intricate implementation details of fault detection and tolerance techniques, while still using their domain knowledge to support fault detection, error correction, and error estimation mechanisms. Our FACTS system translates low-level faults into their consequences for application-level data quality, i.e., consequences domain experts can appreciate and understand. FACTS is an extension of an existing sensor network programming language; its compiler and runtime libraries have been modified to support automatic generation of code for on-line fault detection and tolerance. This code determines the impacts of faults on the accuracies of the results of potentially complex data aggregation and analysis expressions.

Typically, such runtime adaptation in the system level requires the ability to quickly and consistently migrate a task from one core to another. For distributed memory architectures, the policy for transferring the task context between source and destination cores is of vital importance to the performance and to the successful operation of the system. As its performance is negatively correlated with the communication overhead, energy consumption and the dissipated heat, task migration needs to be runtime adaptive to account for the system load, chip temperature, or battery capacity. This work presents a novel context-aware runtime adaptive task migration mechanism (CARAT) that reduces the task migration latency by 93.12%, 97.03% and 100% compared to three state-of-the-art mechanisms and allows to control the maximum migration delay and the performance overhead tradeoff at runtime. This novel mechanism is built on an in-depth analysis of the memory access behavior of several multi-media and robotic embedded-systems applications.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763093","","Adaptive systems;Bandwidth;Context;Delay;Registers;Runtime;System-on-a-chip","computer architecture;resource allocation;ubiquitous computing","CARAT;context-aware runtime adaptive task migration;dynamic thermal management;load balancing;multicore architectures","","4","","20","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It eliminates the search step for different frames by prioritizing and evaluating the neighborhood predictors. It thereby reduces the coding computations by up to 83% with 0.1 dB quality loss. The proposed hardware architecture further improves the throughput by using parallel ME/DE modules with a shared array of SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences) accelerators and by exploiting the four levels of parallelism inherent to the MVC prediction structure (view, frame, reference frame, and macroblock levels). A multi-level pipeline schedule is introduced to reduce the pipeline stalls. The proposed architecture is implemented for a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA and as an ASIC with an IBM 65nm low power technology.

In addition, the power consumption of each tag comparison can be further reduced by dividing the tag comparison into two micro-steps where a partial tag comparison is performed first and, only if the partial tag comparison gives a partial hit, then the remaining tag bits are compared.

For real-time implementations, it is important to statically determine the worst case tick length, also known as the worst case reaction time (WCRT). While there is a considerable body of work on the timing analysis of procedural programs, such analysis for synchronous programs has received less attention. Current state-of-the art analyses for synchronous programs use integer linear programming (ILP) combined with path pruning techniques to achieve tight results. These approaches first convert a concurrent synchronous program into a sequential program. ILP constraints are then derived from this sequential program to compute the longest tick length. In this paper, we use an alternative approach based on model checking. Unlike conventional programs, synchronous programs are concurrent and state-space oriented, making them ideal for model checking based analysis. We propose an analysis of the abstracted state-space of the program, which is combined with expressive data-flow information, to facilitate effective path pruning. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that the proposed approach is both scalable and about 67% tighter compared to the existing approaches.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763043","","Analytical models;Clocks;Computational modeling;Context;Erbium-doped fiber amplifier;Instruction sets;Timing","formal verification;integer programming;linear programming;program diagnostics","ILP constraints;concurrent synchronous program;expressive data flow information;integer linear programming;longest tick length;model checking based analysis;path pruning techniques;procedural programs timing analysis;sequential program;synchronous program;tight WCRT analysis;worst case reaction time;worst case tick length","","3","","19","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This detection scheme guarantees the discovery of all true deadlocks without false alarms unlike state-of-the-art approximation and heuristic approaches. A distributed TC-network architecture which couples with the NoC architecture is also presented to realize the detection mechanism efficiently. Our results based on a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the TC-network method. It drastically outperforms timing-based deadlock detection mechanisms by eliminating false detections and thus reducing energy dissipation in various traffic scenarios.

In comparison, slices in large functional units in a homogenous datapath could be spending many cycles not performing actual useful work. Various fragmentation techniques demonstrated benefits in minimizing the total functional unit area. Upon a closer look at fragmentation techniques, we observe that the area savings achieved by heterogenous datapaths can be traded-off for power optimization. Our specific approach is to introduce choices for functional units with power/area trade-offs for different fragmentation and allocation choices, for reducing power consumption while satisfying the area constraint imposed on the heterogenous datapath. As low power FUs in literature produce an area penalty, a methodology must be developed in order to introduce them in the HLS flow while complying with the area constraint. We propose an allocation and module selection algorithms that pursue a trade-off between area and power consumption for fragmented datapaths under a total area constraint. Results show that it is possible to reduce power by 37% on average (49% in the best case). Moreover latency and cycle time will be equal or nearly the same as in the baseline case, which will lead to an energy reduction, too.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763226","HLS;area;low-power","Adders;Discrete cosine transforms;Optimization;Power demand;Resource management;Scheduling;Switches","high level synthesis;power aware computing","HLS flow;allocation selection algorithm;area trade-off;energy reduction;fragmentation techniques;functional unit area;heterogenous datapath;high-level synthesis technique;module selection algorithm;power consumption;power optimization;power trade-off","","0","","25","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, with similar accuracy and macromodel size, BDSM generates very sparse block-diagonal reduced-order models (ROMs) for massive-port systems at a lower cost, whereas traditional algorithms such as PRIMA produce full dense models inefficient for the subsequent simulation. Third, different from those MOR schemes based on extended Krylov subspace (EKS) technique, BDSM is input-signal independent, so the resulting ROM is reusable under different excitations. Finally, due to its blockdiagonal structure, the obtained ROM can be simulated very fast. The accuracy and efficiency of BDSM are verified by industrial power grid benchmarks.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763014","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Numerical models;Power grids;Read only memory;Sparse matrices","circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;power integrated circuits;reduced order systems","BDSM scheme;EKS technique;MOR methods;PRIMA;ROM;block-diagonal structured model reduction scheme;blockdiagonal structure;column-by-column moment matching;extended Krylov subspace technique;full dense models;industrial power grid benchmarks;input-signal independent;macromodel size;massive-port systems;numerical accuracy;power grid analysis;power grid model order reduction methods;power grid networks;power grid reductions;sparse block-diagonal reduced-order models;subsequent simulation;terminal reduction","","1","","19","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These schedules are able to deliver predictable execution despite the increased levels of device unreliability in future multicore systems. Yet the associated runtime reconfiguration overhead is largely determined by the underlying system topology. Fully connected architectures, although they can effectively hide the overhead in execution migration, become infeasible as the core count grows to hundreds in the near future. We exploit in this paper the high locality associated with adaptive static schedules, and outline a scalable and locally shareable system organization for multicore platforms. With the incorporation of a limited set of neighborhood-centered communication links, threads are allowed to be directly migrated among adjacent cores without physical data movement. At the architecture level, a set of 2-dimensional physical topologies with such a local sharing property embedded is furthermore proposed. The inherent regularity allows these topologies to be adopted as a fixed-silicon multicore platform that can be flexibly redefined according to the parallelism characteristics and resilience needs of each application.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763201","","Bipartite graph;Instruction sets;Merging;Network topology;Organizations;Schedules;Topology","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","2-dimensional physical topology;adaptive static schedules;adjacent cores;architecture level;associated runtime reconfiguration overhead;computational resources;device unreliability;execution migration;fixed-silicon multicore platform;flexible multicore topology;fully connected architectures;high-speed execution reconfiguration;inherent regularity;multicore platforms;multicore systems;neighborhood-centered communication links;parallelism characteristics;physical data movement;predictable execution;resilience needs;resource variation-driven adaptivity;runtime rescheduling decisions;sharing property embedded;system organization;underlying system topology","","0","","12","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore low-power techniques targeted for GPUs will be one of the most hot topics in the future. On the other hand, in several application domains, users are unwilling to sacrifice performance to save power. In this paper, we propose an effective kernel fusion method to reduce the power consumption for GPUs without performance loss. Different from executing multiple kernels serially, the proposed method fuses several kernels into one larger kernel. Owing to the fact that most consecutive kernels in an application have data dependency and could not be fused directly, we split large kernel into multiple slices with strip-mining method, then fuse independent sliced kernels into one kernel. Based on the CUDA programming model, we propose three different kernel fusion implementations, with each one targeting for a special case. Based on the different strip-ming methods, we also propose two fusion mechanisms, which are called invariant-slice fusion and variant-slice fusion. The latter one could be better adapted to the requirements of the kernels to be fused.

Electric double layer capacitors, or simply supercapacitors, have extremely low internal resistance, and a battery-supercapacitor hybrid may mitigate the rate capacity effect for high pulsed discharging current. However, a hybrid architecture comprising a simple parallel connection does not perform well when the supercapacitor capacity is small, which is a typical situation because of the low energy density and high cost of supercapacitors. This paper presents a new battery-supercapacitor hybrid system that employs a constant-current charger.

This paper presents a cost-efficient fault-tolerant decoder for hybrid memories that are impacted by a high degree of non-permanent clustered faults. Fault-tolerant capability is achieved by combining partial hardware redundancy scheme and on-line masking scheme based on Müller C-gates. In addition, the cost-efficient implementation of the decoder is realized by modifying the decoding sequence and implementing it based on time redundancy. Experimental results show that the proposed decoder is able to provide better reliability of the overall hybrid memory system, yet requires smaller area as compared to conventional decoder. For example, when assuming the fault ratio between decoder and memory array is 1:10 and at 10% fault rate, the proposed decoder ensures 1% higher reliability of the overall hybrid memory system. Moreover, the proposed decoder realizes 18.4% smaller area overhead for 64-bit word hybrid memory.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763271","","Arrays;Circuit faults;Decoding;Fault tolerant systems;Redundancy","CMOS memory circuits;fault tolerance;nanoelectronics","CMOS devices;Müller C-gates;cost-efficient fault-tolerant decoder;hybrid nanoelectronic memories;memory array;online masking;reliability","","0","","19","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, NAND flash requires code to be copied to main memory for execution. In inexpensive devices without hardware memory management, full shadowing of an application binary is commonly used to load the program. This approach can lead to a high initial application start-up latency and poor amortization of copy overhead. To overcome these problems, we describe a software-only demand-paging approach that incrementally copies code to memory with a dynamic binary translator (DBT). This approach does not require hardware or operating system support. With careful management, a savings can be achieved in total code footprint, which can offset the size of data structures used by DBT. For applications that cannot amortize full shadowing cost, our approach can reduce start-up latency by 50% or more, and improve performance by 11% on average.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763095","","Ash;Flash memory;Hardware;Loading;Memory management;Shadow mapping;Software","NAND circuits;embedded systems;flash memories;storage management chips","MMU-less embedded system;NAND flash;code footprint;data storage;demand code paging;dynamic binary translator;hardware memory management unit;software-only demand-paging approach","","0","","17","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an interconnect-fault-resilient delay-insensitive asynchronous communication link based on current-flow monitoring. Since current flow upon an interconnect is cut off by an open fault in the interconnect, the current is fed back to a transmitter, which increases a feedback current monotonically. Monitoring the feedback current makes it possible to detect the interconnect fault with delay insensitivity. The proposed link is evaluated by a 0.13μm CMOS technology with a Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)-based asynchronous communication link which is resilient to the interconnect fault without the delay insensitivity.

This can produce efficient code, but has two principal drawbacks: 1) the arbitrary control flow that can be expressed with SyncChart transitions cannot be mapped directly to Esterel, and 2) it is very difficult to map the resulting C code back to the original SyncChart, which hampers traceability. This paper presents an alternative software synthesis approach for SyncCharts that compiles SyncCharts directly into Synchronous C (SC). The compilation preserves the structure of the original SyncChart, which is advantageous for validation and possibly certification.

E-RoC achieves reliability through redundancy by optimizing RAID-like policies tuned for on-chip distributed memories. We achieve on-chip reliability of memories through the use of distributed dynamic scratch pad allocatable memories (DSPAMs) and their allocation policies. We exploit aggressive voltage scaling to reduce power consumption overheads due to parallel DSP AM accesses, and rely on the E-RoC manager to automatically handle any resulting voltage-scaling-induced errors. Our experimental results on multimedia benchmarks show that E-RoC's fully distributed redundant reliable memory subsystem reduces power consumption by up to 85% and latency up to 61 % over traditional reliability approaches that use parity/cyclic hybrids for error checking and correction.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763191","","Dynamic scheduling;Error correction codes;Memory management;Power demand;Reliability;Resource management;System-on-a-chip","RAID;SRAM chips;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","DSPAM;E-RoC;aggressive voltage scaling;die sizes;distributed dynamic scratch pad allocatable memories;embedded RAIDs-on-Chip;error rates;on-chip distributed memory;on-chip memory reliability technique;power reduction;technology scaling","","7","","35","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the practical aspect is not often developed in the literature. But researchers know that these attacks do not always work, like in the case of an RSA accelerator. Indeed, SEMA on RSA needs to make a difference between square and multiply which use the same logic; this contrast with SEMA on ECC, which is easier since doubling and add that are two different operations from the hardware point of view. In this paper, we wonder what to do if a SEMA fails to succeed on a device. Does it mean that no attack is possible? We show that hardware demodulation techniques allow the recording of a signal with more information on the leakage than a raw recording. Then, we propose a generic and fast method enabling to find out demodulation frequencies.

This high level control requires a sensing and communication infrastructure to be put in place across the network. At the same time, the use of electricity in the home, through the potential of real time consumer pricing requires new technologies. This panel session aims to pull together heavy current electrical power engineers and light current electronic engineers to form a discussion and debate about the future role of EDA in applications which are being brought about by changes in the functioning of the power industry. Power engineers from both industry and academia will stimulate the discussion with requirements both from a system perspective and consumer perspective. The representatives from the EDA side will respond with what contributions they believe EDA can make, what already exists or is a simple development problem and what research issues remain in achieving these goals.

Three-dimensional stacked-wafer integrated circuit technology reduces interconnect lengths and improves performance compared to two-dimensional integration. However, it intensifies thermal problems. One remedy is to redistribute white space during floorplanning. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm to redistribute white space. In the first phase, the lateral heat flow white space redistribution problem is formulated as a minimum cycle ratio problem, in which the maximum power density is minimized. Since this phase only considers lateral heat flow, it also works for traditional two-dimensional integrated circuits. In the second phase, to consider inter-layer heat flow in three-dimensional integrated circuits, we discretize the chip into an array of tiles and use a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the maximum stacked tile power consumption. We compared our algorithms with a previously proposed technique based on mathematical programming. Our iterative minimum cycle ratio algorithm achieves 35% more reduction in peak temperature.

We propose an architectural solutions that is based on the idea of partitioning a memory into multiple banks of identical size. While this organization has been widely used for reducing both dynamic and static power, its exploitation for aging benefits requires proper management of the existing idleness of the various banks. This can be achieved by means of a sort of time-varying addressing scheme in which addresses are mapped to different banks over time in such a way that the idleness is uniformly distributed over all the banks.

We propose ReliNoC, a network-on-chip architecture which can withstand failures, while maintaining not only basic connectivity, but also quality-of-service support based on packet priorities. Our network leverages a dual physical channel switch architecture which removes the control overhead of virtual channels (VCs) and utilizes the inherent redundancy within the 2-channel switch to provide spares for faulty elements.

Moreover, in real-time applications predictability of inter-chip communication latency is imperative for bounding the response time of the overall system. In shared-memory MPSoCs buses are still the prevalent means of on-chip communication for small to medium size chip-multi-processors (CMPs). Still, bus arbitration schemes employed in current architectures either deliver good average-case performance (i.e. maximize bus utilization) or enable tight bounding of worst-case-execution time. This paper presents a shared bus arbitration approach allowing high bus utilization while guaranteeing a fixed bandwidth per time frame to each master. Thus it provides high-performance to both realtime and any-time applications or even a mixture of both. The paper includes performance results obtained while executing random traffic on a shared bus implemented on a FPGA. The results show that our approach provides bus utilization close to static priority based arbitration, a fairer bandwidth distribution than Round Robin and latency guarantees identical to TDMA. With this it combines the best properties of these schemes.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763319","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Multicore processing;Real time systems;Time division multiple access","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;shared memory systems;system-on-chip","FPGA;TDMA;average-case performance;bounded latency;bus arbitration scheme;bus utilization;field programmable gate arrays;high-speed shared-memory bus arbitration;interchip communication latency;medium size chip-multiprocessor;multiprocessor system-on-chip;on-chip communication;priority division;real-time application predictability;response time;round robin;shared bus arbitration;shared-memory MPSoC bus;time division multiple access;worst case execution time;worst-case performance","","4","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On-demand redundancy eases the assumptions that traditionally segregate the execution of critical and non-critical tasks (NCTs), making resources available for critical tasks at potentially arbitrary points in both space and time, and otherwise freeing resources to execute non-critical tasks when critical tasks are not executing. Relaxed dedication is one such technique that allows non-critical tasks to execute on critical task resources. Our results demonstrate that for a wide variety of applications and architectures, relaxed dedication is more cost-effective than a traditional approach that employs dedicated resources executing in lockstep. Applied to dual-modular redundancy (DMR), relaxed dedication exposes 73% more NCT cycles than traditional DMR on average, across a wide variety of usage scenarios.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763200","","Analytical models;Hardware;Monitoring;Redundancy;Schedules;Transient analysis","fault tolerant computing;redundancy;system-on-chip","cost reduction;critical tasks;dual-modular redundancy;noncritical tasks;on-demand redundancy;redundant execution;relaxed dedication;safety-critical computer systems;systems-on-chip","","1","","21","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, it is well known that the global climate change dramatically influences the visual appearance of mountain areas like the European Alps. Very destructive geological processes may be triggered or intensified, impacting the stability of slopes, possibly inducing landslides. Unfortunately, the interactions between these complex processes is poorly understood. Therefore, one needs to develop wireless sensing technology as a new scientific instrument for environmental sensing under extreme conditions. Large variations in temperature, humidity, mechanical forces, snow coverage, and unattended operation play a crucial role in long-term deployments. We argue that, in order to significantly advance the application domain, it is inevitable that sensor networks be created as a quality scientific instrument with known and predictable properties, and not as a research toy delivering average observations at best.

Similarly, a generic 2D FPGA architecture can evolve into a 3D one by extending its signal switching scheme from 2D to 3D by means of TSVs. However, replacing all 2D switch boxes (SBs) by 3D ones with full vertical connectivity is found both area-consuming and resource-squandering. Therefore, it is possible to greatly reduce the footprint with only minor delay increase by properly tailoring the structure and deployment strategy of 3D SB. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive architectural exploration of 3D FPGAs. Various architectural alternatives are proposed and then evaluated thoroughly to pick out the most appropriate ones with a better balance between area and delay.

We formulate the determination of optimal speeds for minimizing the peak temperature of execution with task deadlines as a quasiconvex optimization problem.

While hardware accelerators often are stateless, network processing exemplifies the need for stateful hardware acceleration. The packet oriented streaming nature of current networks enables data processing as soon as packets arrive rather than when the data of the whole network flow is available. Due to the concurrence of many flows, an accelerator must maintain and switch contexts between many states of the various accelerated streams embodied in the flows, which increases overhead associated with acceleration. We propose and evaluate dynamic reordering of requests of different accelerated streams in a hybrid on-chip/memory based request queue in order to reduce the associated overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763285","","Acceleration;Context;Hardware;Switches;System-on-a-chip;Throughput;Time factors","computer architecture;general purpose computers;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;optimisation","data processing;dynamic reordering;general-purpose micro-processors cores;hybrid architectures;network processing;optimization;packet oriented streaming nature;power consumption;stateful hardware acceleration","","0","","5","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Resynchronization of Cyclo-Static Dataflow graphs","Hausmans, J.P.H.M.; Bekooij, M.J.G.; Corporaal, H.","","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2011","20110505","2011","","","1","6","Parallel stream processing applications are often executed on shared-memory multiprocessor systems. Synchronization between tasks is needed to guarantee correct functional behavior. An increase in the communication granularity of the tasks in the parallel application can decrease the synchronization overhead. However using coarser-grained synchronization can result in deadlock or violation of the throughput constraint for the application in case of cyclic data dependencies. Resynchronization tries to change the synchronization behavior in order to reduce the synchronization overhead. Determining the amount of resynchronization while preventing deadlock and satisfying the throughput constraint of the application, forms a global analysis problem. In this paper we present a Linear Programming (LP) algorithm for minimizing synchronization by means of resynchronization that is based on the properties of dataflow models. We demonstrate our approach with an extended Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) in a beam-forming application. For this application we reduce the number of synchronization statements with 30% while having a memory constraint of 200 tokens. The algorithm which calculates this reduction takes less than 20 milliseconds for this problem instance.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763211","","Computational modeling;Memory management;Production;Schedules;Synchronization;System recovery;Throughput","array signal processing;data flow graphs;linear programming;shared memory systems","beam-forming application;coarser-grained synchronization;constant modulus algorithm;cyclo-static dataflow graph resynchronization;linear programming algorithm;parallel stream processing applications;shared-memory multiprocessor systems","","2","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to its computational complexity, the turbo decoder is one of the most power hungry blocks in digital baseband. To alleviate this issue, one way is to avoid surplus computing phases thanks to the early termination of the iterative decoding process. The use of stopping criteria is one of the most common algorithm level power reduction methods in literature. These methods always come with some hardware overhead. In this paper, a new trellis based stopping criterion is proposed. The novelty of this approach is the lower hardware overhead thanks to the use of trellis states as key parameter to stop the iterative process. Results are showing the importance of this added hardware in terms of method efficiency. Compared to state-of-the-art Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) based techniques, proposed Low Complexity Trellis Based (LCTB) is demonstrating 23% less power consumption on average, for comparable performance level in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Frame Error Rate (FER).","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763107","low complexity;power reduction;stopping criteria;trellis states;turbo-decoder","Bit error rate;Complexity theory;Decoding;Hardware;Iterative decoding;Power demand;Radiation detectors","computational complexity;error statistics;iterative decoding;power aware computing;telecommunication standards;turbo codes","3GPP-LTE;advanced digital communication standards;bit error rate;computational complexity;digital baseband;frame error rate;iterative decoding process;level power reduction methods;log likelihood ratio;low complexity stopping criterion;low complexity trellis based;power consumption reduction;surplus computing phases;turbo codes;turbo decoders","","0","","21","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the resilient nature of the applications, lightweight error detection logic is sufficient for operation, and no expensive error recovery circuitry is required. On a hardware block implementing texture decompression, we observe 25% to 30% energy reduction at negligible quality loss (compared to the error introduced by the lossy compression algorithm).

These attacks rely on intentionally induced faults. Such intentional faults have not only a different origin, but also a different nature than errors that fault-tolerant systems usually have to face. For instance an adversary who attacks the circuit with two lasers can potentially induce two errors at different positions. Such errors can not only defeat simple double modular redundancy schemes, but as we show, also naive schemes based on any linear code over GF(2). In this article, we describe arithmetic logic units (ALUs) which provide high error detection rates even in the presence of such errors. The contribution in this article is threefold. First, we show that the minimum weight of an undetected error is no longer defined by the code distance when certain arithmetic and logic operations are applied to the codewords. As a result, additional hardware is needed to preserve the minimum error weight for a given code. Second, we show that for multi-residue codes, these delicate operations are rare in typical smart card applications. This allows for an efficient time-area trade-off for checking the codewords and thus to significantly reduce the hardware costs for such a protected ALU. Third, we implement the proposed architectures and study the influence of the register file and a multiplier on the area and on the critical path.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763261","","Adders;Computer architecture;Delay;Hardware;Linear code;Redundancy;Registers","arithmetic codes;cryptography;error detection;linear codes","arithmetic logic units;fault attacks;high error detection rates;linear code;security-aware embedded systems","","2","","18","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although scheduling for basic FlexRay networks is not new, prior work in this domain does not utilize the branch parallelism that is available when a FlexRay switch is used. In addition to the novel exploitation of branch parallelism, the scheduling algorithms proposed in this paper also support all slot multiplexing options as defined in the FlexRay v 3.0 protocol specification. This includes support for the newly added repetition rates and support for multiplexing frames from different sending nodes in the same slot. Our first algorithm quickly produces a schedule given the communication requirements, network topology and FlexRay parameters, but cannot guarantee an optimal schedule in terms of the bandwidth efficiency and extensibility.

This leads to power and temperature hot-spots, which may cause non-uniform ageing and accelerated chip failure. These critical issues can be tackled on-line by closed-loop thermal and reliability management policies. Model predictive controllers (MPC) outperform classic feedback controllers since they are capable of minimizing a cost function while enforcing safe working temperature. Unfortunately basic MPC controllers rely on a-priori knowledge of multicore thermal model and their complexity exponentially grows with the number of controlled cores. In this paper we present a scalable, fully-distributed, energy-aware thermal management solution. The model-predictive controller complexity is drastically reduced by splitting it in a set of simpler interacting controllers, each allocated to a core in the system. Locally, each node selects the optimal frequency to meet temperature constraints while minimizing the performance penalty and system energy. Global optimality is achieved by letting controllers exchange a limited amount of information at run-time on a neighbourhood basis. We address model uncertainty by supporting learning of the thermal model with a novel distributed self-calibration approach that matches well the controller architecture.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763141","","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Frequency control;Mathematical model;Multicore processing;Predictive models;Temperature control","ageing;distributed control;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;predictive control;temperature control;thermal management (packaging)","accelerated chip failure;closed loop thermal;distributed model predictive control;energy aware thermal management solution;energy management;high performance multicores;model uncertainty;multicore processor;nonuniform ageing;reliability management policy;self calibrating model predictive control","","13","","26","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Panel: “Will 3D-IC remain a technology of the future… Even in the future?”","Casale-Rossi, Marco; Leduc, Patrick; De Micheli, Giovanni; Blouet, Patrick; Farley, Brendan; Fontanelli, Anna; Milojevic, Dragomir; Smith, Steve","Synopsys, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1526","1530","If asked “who needs faster planes?” the vast majority of the 2.75 billion airline passengers (source: IATA 2011) would say that they do need faster planes, and that they need them right now. Still, the commercial aircrafts cruising speed has remained the same - 800 km/hour - over the last 50+ years, and after the sad end of the Concorde project, neither Airbus nor Boeing are seriously working on the topic. Along the same lines, when asked “who needs 3D-IC?”, most IC designers say that they desperately need 3D-IC to keep advancing electronic products performance, whilst addressing the needs of higher bandwidth, lower cost, heterogeneous integration, and power constraints. Still, 3D-IC continues to be the technology of the future. What are the road blocks towards 3D-IC adoption? Is it process technology, foundry or OSAT commercial offering, or EDA, or the business economics that is holding 3D-IC on the ground? In the introductory presentation of this panel session, LETI Patrick Leduc will illustrate the state-of-the-art of commercial, mainstream 3D-IC. EPFL Professor Giovanni de Micheli will then moderate an industry and research panel, to understand what are the key factors preventing 3D-IC from becoming the technology of today.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513756","","","","","","0","","","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"P2012: Building an ecosystem for a scalable, modular and high-efficiency embedded computing accelerator","Benini, L.; Flamand, E.; Fuin, D.; Melpignano, D.","STMicroelectron., Grenoble, France","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2012","20120403","2012","","","983","987","P2012 is an area- and power-efficient many-core computing fabric based on multiple globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) clusters supporting aggressive fine-grained power, reliability and variability management. Clusters feature up to 16 processors and one control processor with independent instruction streams sharing a multi-banked L1 data memory, a multi-channel DMA engine, and specialized hardware for synchronization and scheduling. P2012 achieves extreme area and energy efficiency by supporting domain-specific acceleration at the processor and cluster level through the addition of dedicated HW IPs. P2012 can run standard OpenCL and OpenMP parallel codes well as proprietary Native Programming Model (NPM) SW components that provide the highest level of control on application-to-resource mapping. In Q3 2011 the P2012 SW Development Kit (SDK) has been made available to a community of R&D users; it includes full OpenCL and NPM development environments. The first P2012 SoC prototype in 28nm CMOS will sample in Q4 2012, featuring four clusters and delivering 80GOPS (with single precision floating point support) in 15.2mm<sup>2</sup> with 2W power consumption.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176639","","Computer architecture;Fabrics;Hardware;Program processors;Programming;System-on-a-chip","CMOS memory circuits;file organisation;integrated circuit reliability;parallel architectures;power aware computing;shared memory systems;synchronisation;system-on-chip","HW IPs;NPM development environments;OpenCL parallel codes;OpenMP parallel codes;P2012 SW development kit;P2012 SoC prototype;Q3 2011;Q4 2012;R&D users;SW components;aggressive fine-grained power management;application-to-resource mapping;area-efficient many-core computing fabric;control processor;domain-specific acceleration;energy efficiency;globally asynchronous locally synchronous clusters;high-efficiency embedded computing accelerator;independent instruction streams;modular embedded computing accelerator;multibanked L1 data memory sharing;multichannel DMA engine;native programming model;power consumption;power-efficient many-core computing fabric;processors scheduling;reliability management;size 28 nm;synchronization;variability management","","43","","5","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optimization techniques for craig interpolant compaction in unbounded model checking","Cabodi, G.; Loiacono, C.; Vendraminetto, D.","Dipartimento di Automatica ed Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Italy","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1417","1422","This paper addresses the problem of reducing the size of Craig interpolants generated within inner steps of SAT-based Unbounded Model Checking. Craig interpolants are obtained from refutation proofs of unsatisfiable SAT runs, in terms of and/or circuits of linear size, w.r.t. the proof. Existing techniques address proof reduction, whereas interpolant compaction is typically considered as an implementation problem, tackled using standard logic synthesis techniques. We propose an integrated three step process, in which we: (1) exploit an existing technique to detect and remove redundancies in refutation proofs, (2) apply combinational logic reductions (constant propagation, ODC-based simplifications, and BDD-based sweeping) directly on the proof graph data structure, (3) eventually apply ad hoc combinational logic synthesis steps on interpolant circuits. The overall procedure is novel (as well as parts of the above listed steps), and represents an advance w.r.t. the state-of-the art. The paper includes an experimental evaluation, showing the benefits of the proposed technique, on a set of benchmarks from the Hardware Model Checking Competition 2011.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513735","","Boolean functions;Compaction;Data structures;Interpolation;Model checking;Optimized production technology","","","","1","","26","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent experimentation suggests that it outperforms interpolation-based verification, which had been considered the best known algorithm for this purpose for almost a decade. In this work, we present a generalization of PDR to the theory of quantifier free formulae over bitvectors (QF BV), illustrate the new algorithm with representative examples and provide experimental results obtained from experimentation with a prototype implementation.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513614","","Approximation algorithms;Cognition;Hardware;Model checking;Optimization;Runtime;Upper bound","","","","3","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
