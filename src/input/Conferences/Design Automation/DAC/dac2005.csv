In addition to meet the design schedule for the new implementation, the reduction of the mask set have become very critical. In this paper, we propose a new method to add a programmable rectification module to reduce the mask cost and to improve the turn around time. When a modification is needed, one can program the rectification module to achieve the new implementation. The rectification module can be designed by one mask programmable gate array, or an embedded FPGA. To reduce the size needed for the rectification module, we also propose algorithms, which can intelligently select some internal signals of the old implementation to become pseudo primary inputs and primary outputs. Our experimental results are very encouraging.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466510","","Circuits;Controllability;Costs;Design automation;Design engineering;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic design;Observability;Power engineering and energy;Very large scale integration","VLSI;electronic design automation;field programmable gate arrays;logic circuits;logic design;rectification","VLSI design;design automation;design constraints;design errors;design implementation;design schedule;embedded FPGA;internal signals;mask cost reduction;mask set reduction;primary outputs;programmable gate array;programmable rectification module;pseudo primary inputs;rectification logic","","3","","7","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method divides SoC system design flow into three levels (i.e. system model level, virtual components level and real components level) to achieve separation of function from structure and separation of computation from communication. Hi-PBD defines two mapping processes (i.e. design planning and virtual-real synthesis) to go through all the three design levels. Hi-PBD supports reuse of both the three level design templates and the two mapping results, which increased reusing efficiency greatly. Besides, Hi-PBD boosts up design flexibility by means of supporting revision at all the three levels, and ensures the final design target satisfies performance requirements through a novel performance constraints transmission strategy. Experiments indicate Hi-PBD method improves SoC high level design efficiency by 30%-40%, and this method achieves platform template reuse ratio by 75%-90%.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466584","","Computer science;Design methodology;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Hardware;Process design;Process planning;Productivity;System-on-a-chip;Very large scale integration","circuit CAD;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;system-on-chip","Hi-PBD method;SoC high level design efficiency;SoC system design flow;design planning;hardware-software co-design;hierarchical platform-based design method;mapping process;performance constraints transmission strategy;platform template reuse ratio;real components level;system model level;virtual components level;virtual-real synthesis","","2","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design complexity, uncertainty in environmental and fabrication conditions, and single-event upsets all conspire to compromise system correctness and reliability. Recently, researchers have begun to advocate a new design strategy called better than worst-case design that couples a complex core component with a simple reliable checker mechanism. By delegating the responsibility for correctness and reliability of the design to the checker, it becomes possible to build probably correct designs that effectively address the challenges of deep submicron design. In this paper, we present the concepts of better than worst-case design and highlight two exemplary designs: the DIVA checker and Razor logic. We show how this approach to system implementation relaxes design constraints on core components, which reduces the effects of physical design challenges and creates opportunities to optimize performance and power characteristics. We demonstrate the advantages of relaxed design constraints for the core components by applying typical case optimization (TCO) techniques to an adder circuit. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities posed to CAD tools in the context of better than worst-case design. In particular, we describe the additional support required for analyzing run time characteristics of designs and the many opportunities which are created to incorporate typical-case optimizations into synthesis and verification.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466113","","Adders;Computer architecture;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Fabrication;Logic design;Microprocessors;Silicon;Uncertainty;Voltage","adders;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;logic design","CAD tools;DIVA checker;Razor logic;adder circuit;better than worst-case design;core components;deep submicron design;fabrication technology;nanometer regime;reliable checker mechanism;run time characteristics;typical case optimization techniques","","23","1","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another effect of shrinking feature size is that the wires are becoming unreliable as they are increasingly susceptible to various noise sources such as cross-talk, coupling noise, soft errors etc. Increasing importance of wire delay and reliability has lead to a communication centric design approach, networks on chip (NoC), for building complex SoCs. Current NoC communication design methodologies are based on conservative design approaches and consider worst case operating conditions for link design, resulting in large latency penalty for data transmission. In order to substantially decrease the link delay and thereby increase system performance an aggressive design approach is needed. In this work we present Terror, timing error tolerant communication system, for aggressively designing the links of NoCs. In our methodology, instead of avoiding timing errors by a worst-case design, we do aggressive design by tolerating timing errors. Simulation results show large latency savings (up to 35%) for the Terror based system compared to traditional design methodology.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466449","","Buildings;Crosstalk;Delay;Design methodology;Network-on-a-chip;System-on-a-chip;Telecommunication network reliability;Timing;Transistors;Wire","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;system-on-chip","Terror;aggressive design approach;communication centric design approach;communication design;coupling noise;crosstalk noise;data transmission;interconnect wire delay;latency penalty;latency savings;networks on chips;reliable link design;soft errors;systems on chips;timing error tolerant communication system;timing errors;worst-case design","","6","1","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While in programmable on-chip interconnection networks such as the routing networks in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), switch boxes are often used for a better tradeoff between routability and area efficiency. Much work has been done on the topology design of switch boxes, e.g. universal switch boxes and hyper-universal switch boxes. However, the layout design of switch boxes tends to be difficult when the topology of switch boxes is less regular. In this paper we revisit the theoretical design aspects of the classic crossbar design schemes and further investigate a new design style, a so called meta-crossbar, which is obtained from a crossbar by adding the least number of switches and direct contacts to achieve the desired optimal routability. We show that a switch box can always be implemented by a meta-crossbar. This means that the layout design of switch boxes can be done almost like crossbars. As a result, we present a hyper-universal meta-crossbar design, and a three level meta-crossbar based interconnection network design, which is capable of routing all group communication requirements.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466487","","Communication networks;Communication standards;Communication switching;Fabrication;Field programmable gate arrays;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Routing;Switches","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network routing;programmable circuits","communication networks;crossbar design schemes;field programmable gate arrays;hyper-universal switch boxes;layout design;meta-crossbar;programmable interconnection networks;routing algorithm;routing networks;switch matrix;switching modules;topology design;universal switch boxes","","0","","14","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As technology scales, with ever shrinking geometries and higher density circuits, the issue of soft errors and reliability in a complex chip design is becoming a challenging design criterion. Soft errors are caused by radiation, which directly or indirectly induces a localized ionization capable of upsetting internal circuit states. While these errors can result in an upset event, the circuit itself is most often not damaged. Addressing soft error issues is important for a broad range of companies either because they incorporate many semiconductor devices that are prone to soft errors in their system or because they design embedded memories, FPGAs and microprocessors.

As a case study, a speed-up of 94% over architectural simulation is reported for the MPEG application.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466498","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Delay effects;Discrete event simulation;Intelligent networks;Network-on-a-chip;Process design;Space exploration;Switches","data compression;system-on-chip","MPEG application;SoC design;SoCExplore;architectural simulation;communication evaluation;communication-centric design;cycle-accurate interconnect simulation;error analysis;flexible framework;interconnect design space exploration;network-based interconnects","","1","","14","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The refinement process inserts automatically control structures to treat delays induced by the use of RTL IPs. It also inserts a control structure to coordinate the execution of parallel clocked IP. The delays may be managed by registers or by counters included in the control structure.

Leakage power, especially subthreshold leakage and gate leakage, and soft error are challenging the design of SRAM. While these important issues have been separately addressed in previous SRAM designs, there exists no design that simultaneously cuts down leakage power and enhances the resistance to soft error. In this work, we have built the first such SRAM cell, by hybrid of high-κ gate dielectric and dynamic threshold voltage which is realized in the form of jointly biased gate and substrate transistor. The HSRAM not only makes the gate leakage negligible, but lessens the severe increase of subthreshold leakage caused by Fringing/Field Induced Barrier Lowering (FIBL) effect accompanied with the introduction of high-κ gate dielectric, and in the same time reduces the susceptibility to soft error by increasing the node capacitance. Experiments were performed in both transistor level and circuit level for this novel HSRAM using ISE8.0 and HSPICE. They indicate that up to 93% reduction in total leakage is possible by using HSRAM cell, with an up to 23% increase in reliability degree and an up to 73% reduction in bitline delay, compared to standard 6T SRAM.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466222","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Dielectric substrates;Energy consumption;Gate leakage;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Robustness;Subthreshold current;Tunneling","CMOS memory circuits;SRAM chips;integrated circuit design;leakage currents","HSPICE;ISE8.0;dynamic threshold voltage;fringing/field induced barrier lowering effect;gate leakage;high-κ gate dielectric;hybrid SRAM cell;leakage power;node capacitance;robust SRAM cell design;soft error;sub-100nm technologies;subthreshold leakage","","2","","36","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in nanotechnologies, manufacture time defect levels and operational time fault rates are expected to be quite high. Straightforward triple modular redundancy (TMR) based fault tolerance is inappropriate for QCA nanotechnology since wire delays dominate the logic delays and faults in wires dominate the faults in a QCA based design. Furthermore, long wires are necessary in TMR based designs. In this paper we show that fault-tolerance can be obtained by using TMR with shifted operands (TMRSO). TMRSO uses shorter wires of QCA cells and exploits the self-latching property of clocked QCA arrays to provide the same level of fault tolerance capability as straightforward TMR while being significantly faster and smaller. This technique can be applied to a variety of operations; we have validated TMRSO on adders. Implementation results obtained using QCA designer show that an 8-bit adder using TMRSO has more than 50% area reduction and more than 100% throughput improvement when compared to a TMR implementation.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466555","","Delay;Energy consumption;Fault tolerance;Logic design;Manufacturing;Nanotechnology;Quantum cellular automata;Quantum dots;Redundancy;Wires","adders;delays;fault tolerance;logic design;logic gates;low-power electronics;nanotechnology;quantum dots;redundancy","8 bit;TMRSO;clocked QCA arrays;fault tolerance;fault tolerant;logic delays;low power consumption;nanotechnology;operational time fault rates;quantum cellular array design;quantum-dot cellular automata technology;self-latching property;shifted operands;time defect levels;triple modular redundancy;wire delays;wire faults","","6","1","12","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sleep transistor sizing is the key issue when MTCMOS circuit is designed. If the sleep transistor size is too large, the circuit performance can be maintained but the dynamic power consumption of the sleep transistor will increase. On the other hand, if the sleep transistor size is too small, there will be significant performance degradation because of the increased resistance to ground. Previous approach (Kao et al., 1998; Anis et al., 2002) designed the sleep transistor size based on mutual exclusive discharge patterns. However, these approaches considered only topology of a circuit. We observed that two possible simultaneous switching gates may not discharge at the same time in terms of functionality. Thus, we propose an algorithm to determine how to cluster cells to share sleep transistors taking both topology and functionality into consideration. The results show that the proposed method can achieve on the average 18% reduction ratio in terms of the number of sleep transistors as compared to the method without considering functionality.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466477","","Circuit topology;Computer industry;Computer science;Degradation;Energy consumption;Leakage current;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Sleep;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;network topology","MTCMOS circuit;cell clustering;circuit topology;functionality directed clustering;low power MTCMOS design;multi-threshold CMOS circuit;sleep transistor;switching gates","","1","1","7","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we deal with the module placement with symmetry constraints for analog design using the transitive closure graph-sequence (TCG-S) representation. Since the geometric relationships of modules are transparent to TCG-S and its induced operations, TCG-S has better flexibility than previous works in dealing with symmetry constraints. We first propose the necessary and sufficient conditions of TCG-S for symmetry modules. Then, we propose a polynomial-time packing algorithm for a TCG-S with symmetry constraints. Experimental results show that the TCG-S based algorithm results in the best area utilization.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466541","","Analog circuits;Analog computers;Computer industry;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Industrial relations;Information management;Information science;Polynomials;Sufficient conditions","analogue circuits;graph theory","TCG-S;analog layout design;area utilization;device matching;module placement;polynomial-time packing algorithm;symmetry constraints;symmetry modules;transitive closure graph-sequence","","18","1","14","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the ASP-DAC 2005. Asia and South Pacific","20050718","2005","1","","405","411 Vol. 1","In this paper, we present a floorplanning algorithm for 3D ICs. The problem can be formulated as that of packing a given set of 3D rectangular blocks while minimizing a suitable cost function. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of the classical 2D slicing floorplans to 3D slicing floorplans. A new encoding scheme of slicing floorplans (2D/3D) and its associated set of moves form the basis of the new simulated annealing based algorithm. The best-known algorithm for packing 3D rectangular blocks is based on simulated annealing using sequence-triple floorplan representation. Experimental results show that our algorithm produces packing results on average 3% better than the sequence-triple-based algorithm under the same annealing parameters, and our algorithm runs much faster (17 times for problems containing 100 blocks) than the sequence-triple. Moreover, our algorithm can be extended to consider various types of placement constraints and thermal distribution while the existing sequence-triple-based algorithm does not have such capabilities. Finally, when specializing to 2D problems, our algorithm is a new 2D slicing floorplanning algorithm. We are excited to report the surprising results that our new 2D floorplanner has produced slicing floorplans for the two largest MCNC benchmarks ami33 and ami49 which have the smallest areas (among all slicing/nonslicing floorplanning algorithms) ever reported in the literature.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466197","","CMOS technology;Computer science;Cost function;Encoding;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Simulated annealing;Testing;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Very large scale integration","VLSI;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","2D slicing floorplans;3D VLSI design;3D rectangular blocks;3D slicing floorplans;annealing based algorithm;encoding scheme;placement constraints;sequence-triple floorplan representation;simulated annealing;thermal distribution","","16","1","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Leakage power: trends, analysis and avoidance","Blaauw, D.; Devgan, A.; Najm, F.","Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Design Automation Conference, 2005. Proceedings of the ASP-DAC 2005. Asia and South Pacific","20050718","2005","1","","T","2 Vol. 1","Leakage power is emerging as a key challenge in IC design. Leakage is increasingly exponentially with each technology generation and is expected to become the dominant part of total power. Device threshold voltage scaling, shrinking device dimensions, and larger circuit sizes are causing this dramatic increase in leakage. As leakage varies exponentially with process parameters, yield of the chip is often directly influenced by leakage. Increasing amount of leakage is also critical for power constraint ICs. Traditionally, leakage has been considered as an important design variable in handheld devices and in standby circuit operation. However, this significant increase of leakage now warrants that it be considered as the key design variable in all IC designs. This tutorial presents a comprehensive review of leakage power issues in IC design. The tutorial is organized in four major parts. The first part provides an overview of technology and scaling trends which are causing the significant increase in leakage current. The device physics that leads to subthreshold and gate leakage were described, along with their dependence on circuit design variables. This part of the tutorial also covered basic transistor and circuit techniques to minimize leakage, such as the stack effect. The second part of the tutorial focused on circuit level leakage estimation and avoidance. Use of multiple threshold voltages has been very successful in controlling the leakage of the circuit. Comprehensive description of multiple-Vt techniques for leakage avoidance will be presented along with associated leakage estimation techniques. Multiple-threshold design (MTCMOS) will be described along with its leakage benefits and performance trade-offs. Multiple oxide technology options and associated impact on gate leakage will also be discussed. Third part of the tutorial focuses on chip level effects on leakage. Leakage is heavily dependent on local and global process variations and can vary by an order of magnitude over the technology spread. Leakage estimation techniques which consider both inter and intra die process variations were covered. This part of the tutorial also focuses on chip-level leakage minimization techniques. Leakage minimization techniques such as adaptive body bias (ABB) a- nd power supply control were presented. The last part of the tutorial covers system and circuit architectures for leakage avoidance. In standby mode, the leakage of the circuit can be lowered by putting it a low-leakage state. Caches and memory circuits occupy large percentage of area in model chips. The leakage of caches and memories need to be carefully controlled. This section of the tutorial covered topics including state assignment for leakage minimization, leakage-driven memory and cache circuits and architectures. The tutorial is intended for designers and CAD engineers interested in next generation design techniques and methodologies and emerging power challenges. Basic background of VLSI and CAD is useful though not needed.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466116","","Circuits;Design automation;Gate leakage;Handheld computers;Leakage current;Minimization;Physics;Power generation;Threshold voltage;Tutorial","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;cache storage;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated memory circuits;leakage currents","CAD engineers;VLSI;adaptive body bias;cache circuit leakage;chip level effects;circuit architectures;circuit level leakage avoidance;circuit level leakage estimation;device physics;device threshold voltage scaling;gate leakage;handheld devices;integrated circuit design;interdie process;intradie process;leakage current;leakage minimization;leakage power;memory circuit leakage;multiple oxide technology;multiple threshold voltage;multiple-threshold design;power supply control;shrinking device dimensions;stack effect;standby circuit operation;subthreshold leakage;transistor techniques","","0","","","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They allow analyzing essential characteristics of a system design in an early design stage and supporting therewith the choice of important design decisions. While analytical methods for system level performance analysis lead to hard bounded analysis results, the obtained results are often overly pessimistic due to a lack of details such analytical methods can incorporate in their system analysis. To overcome this problem, we present new abstract models for event streams and system components of embedded systems, and show how these models can be combined to modules for modular performance analysis. With the presented models, we can capture complex functional properties of systems, as for example caches, variable resource demand of events in an event stream, or arbitrary up- and down-sampling of event streams in a system component. The applicability of our models and their advantages over traditional models for performance analysis are shown in a case study of a system component with LRU (least recently used) cache.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466429","","Analytical models;Automata;Computer networks;Electronic mail;Laboratories;Performance analysis;Process design;Real time systems;System analysis and design;Tail","cache storage;circuit simulation;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","abstract models;complex embedded systems;complex functional properties;design decisions;design process;event streams;hard real-time systems;least recently used cache;modular performance analysis;system components;system design;system level performance analysis;variable resource demand","","2","","15","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important design decision in building a GALS FPGA architecture is to determine the appropriate GALS island size. A large GALS island will reduce the asynchronous communication overhead but the interconnect delay inside an island is increased. On the other hand, asynchronous communication overhead could be a major concern for a small GALS island size. In this paper, we propose a design flow to investigate this tradeoff. The input circuit is first divided into partitions according to the specified GALS island size and each partition is then implemented with commercially available CAD tools. The overall system performance is estimated by a performance evaluator. Experimental results validate our design flow and show a performance improvement of around 20% by adopting a GALS architecture.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466572","","Asynchronous communication;Buildings;Circuit optimization;Delay;Design automation;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Registers;System performance;Wire","asynchronous circuits;circuit CAD;delays;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;synchronisation","CAD tools;GALS FPGA architecture;GALS architecture;GALS island size;asynchronous communication;globally asynchronous locally synchronous design;interconnect delay;long wire delay;technology scaling","","3","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces Model Algebra, a formalism built on top of system level design languages, that can be used for implementing functionality preserving transformations on system level models. Such transformations enable us to implement high level design decisions without having to write new models for each design decision. Moreover, since these transformations preserve functionality, the transformed models do not need to be reverified. We present the definition of Model Algebra and show how system level models can be represented as expressions in this formalism. The laws of Model Algebra are use to define correct model transformations. We show a system level design scenario, where design decisions gradually refine the functional model of the system to an architectural model with components and communication structure. The refinement can be performed using the correct model transformations in our formalism.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466146","","Algebra;Boolean functions;Carbon capture and storage;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Hardware;Hierarchical systems;High level synthesis;Petri nets;System-level design","formal verification;high level synthesis;specification languages","abstraction level;architectural model;functionality preserving transformations;high level design decision;model algebra;model transformations;system level design languages;system level models;system level transformations","","3","","9","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent advances of micro-architecture model enabled the use of stacked based controller, allowing complex algorithms with multiple procedures to be implemented directly in hardware. Nevertheless, design optimizations across procedure boundaries have not been fully explored. In this paper, we address the problem of interprocedural register allocation in the context of high level synthesis. In contrast to a recently proposed interprocedural register allocation algorithm, which processes an expensive, global, graph representation of the conflict relation of all values to achieve near optimally, we introduce a new method, called color palette propagation (CPP). The key idea behind our method, is to propagate the use of colors, whose number is significantly smaller than the size of the conflict relation, across different procedures. With a complexity comparable to intraprocedural register allocation, we show that our method can scale to very large C programs. For those benchmarks that can be handled by conventional global methods, our method produced nearly the same number of registers, while providing an average speedup factor of 90.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466217","","Application software;Color;Computer industry;Costs;Design methodology;Design optimization;Hardware;High level synthesis;Job shop scheduling;Registers","circuit optimisation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;storage allocation","C programs;color palette propagation;design optimizations;high level synthesis;intraprocedural register allocation;microarchitecture model;register transfer level design;scalable interprocedural register allocation;stacked based controller","","1","","22","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since a clock routing is carried out based on register locations, register placement actually has fundamental influence to a clock network size. In this paper, we propose a new clock network design methodology that incorporates register placement optimization. Given a cell placement result, incremental modifications are performed according to clock skew specifications. The incremental placement change moves registers toward preferred locations that may enable a small clock network size. At the same time, the side-effect to logic cell placement and wire connections is controlled.

The method is a combination of several computational techniques including the Green function method, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), and the table look-up technique. The high accuracy of the algorithm comes from the fully analytical nature of the Green function method, and the high efficiency is due to the application of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique to compute the DCT and later obtaining the temperature field for any power source distribution using the pre-calculated look-up table. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method has a relative error of below 1% compared with commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) softwares for thermal analysis, while the efficiency of our method is orders of magnitude higher than the direct application of the Green function method.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466136","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Circuits;Computational fluid dynamics;Design automation;Discrete cosine transforms;Distributed computing;Green function;Temperature distribution;Very large scale integration","Green's function methods;VLSI;discrete cosine transforms;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit reliability;table lookup;temperature distribution","Green function method;VLSI chips;VLSI circuits;circuit layout;computational fluid dynamic softwares;design automation tools;discrete cosine transform;fast Fourier transform;on-chip temperature distribution;power source distribution;table look-up;temperature-related effects;thermal analysis","","27","1","17","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assuming fixed architectural templates, information given in the ADL is directly mapped to a hardware description on register transfer level (RTL). Gate-level synthesis tools are not able to perform potential optimizations, as the computational complexity grows exponential with the size of the architecture. Information such as exclusiveness, parallelism or Boolean relations are spread over multiple modules and therefore hard to determine. In this paper, we present an ASIP synthesis approach from architecture description languages, based on an intermediate representation (IR).

A placement algorithm that is ""stable"" consistently drives towards similar solutions, even with changes in the input netlist and placement parameters. Indeed, the stability of the algorithm is arguably as important a characteristic as the wirelength it achieves. However, currently there is no way to actually quantify the stability of a placement algorithm. This work seeks to address the issue by proposing metrics that measure the stability of a placement algorithm. Our experimental results examine the stability of three different placement algorithms with our proposed metrics and convincingly illustrate that some algorithms are quantifiably more stable than others.

It is also an attractive platform for system-on-chip or system-in-package solutions. A critical issue in 3D circuit design is heat dissipation. In this paper we propose an efficient 3D multilevel routing approach that includes a novel through-the-silicon via (TS-via) planning algorithm. The proposed approach features an adaptive lumped resistive thermal model and a two-step multilevel TS-via planning scheme. Experimental results show that with multilevel TS-via planning, the thermal-driven approach can reduce the maximum temperature to the required temperature with reasonable wirelength increase. Compared to a post processing approach for dummy TS-via insertion, to achieve the same required temperature, our approach uses 80% fewer TS-vias. To our knowledge, this proposed approach is the first thermal-driven 3D routing algorithm.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466143","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Finite difference methods;Integrated circuit packaging;Routing;System-on-a-chip;Temperature;Thermal conductivity;Thermal resistance;Three-dimensional integrated circuits","integrated circuit design;network routing","3D circuit design;3D integrated circuit;3D multilevel routing;TS-via insertion;adaptive thermal model;heat dissipation;lumped resistive thermal model;multilevel TS-via planning scheme;system-in-package;system-on-chip;thermal-driven multilevel routing;through-the-silicon via planning algorithm;two-step TS-via planning scheme","","47","","24","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications are also consisting of multiple (sub) tasks that are presented as different source code which can be partly executed concurrently. However, the subtask-level parallelism inside a single task is often too limited to fully utilize all the parallel processors and results in many slacks on processors. To better use the processors, subtasks of multiple tasks will have to be executed in an interleaving fashion. This paper proposes design-time algorithms to interleave subtasks based on the separated schedules of tasks. This interleaver can be considered as part of a hierarchical scheduler to steer the code generation of very complex applications with many tasks. The scheduling experiments show that the execution time can be shortened by 20%-30% when interleaving two tasks against the sequential execution without subtask interleaving. Moreover, the differences between the solutions given by our scheduling algorithm and the optimal solutions are less than 6% for up to 20 subtasks.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466497","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific processors;Clustering algorithms;Digital signal processing chips;Interleaved codes;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Switches;System-on-a-chip;Time to market","computational complexity;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling;program compilers;system-on-chip","code generation;design-time algorithms;heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms;hierarchical task scheduler;parallel processors;scheduling algorithm;system-on-a-chip","","0","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particularly, multiple cores that need to access the off-chip memory system may contend with each other for the same buses/pins to get there. While it is possible to structure on-chip memory space as shared memory or private memory, each of these has its own drawbacks. In an attempt to achieve lower power consumption than these conventional memory architectures, this paper proposes and evaluates an application-specific hybrid memory architecture that has both shared and private components. The approach is built upon the idea of capturing the amount of privately-accessed and shared data across processors through a polyhedral tool, and using this information to guide memory space partitioning across two dimensions, namely, across parallel processors and across shared and private memory components. We evaluate the resulting memory configurations using a set of benchmarks and compare them to pure private and pure shared architectures. When running the same set of applications with the same code optimizations, our results indicate that the proposed hybrid memory design methodology leads to much less power consumption than the conventional architectures.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466448","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Concrete;Costs;Data engineering;Delay;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Energy consumption;Memory architecture","memory architecture;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power consumption","application-specific hybrid memory;code optimizations;customized on-chip memories;data accesses;embedded chip multiprocessors;hybrid memory design;memory architectures;memory space partitioning;off-chip memory;parallel processors;polyhedral tool;power consumption;private memory;shared memory","","4","","16","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Setting the parameters so as to optimize certain metrics requires the use of efficient design space exploration (DSE) strategies and also simulation tools (retargetable compilers and simulators) and accurate estimation models operating at a high level of abstraction.

Although these sparsification techniques work well in practice, the stability of these approximations has not been established, i.e., the sparsified reluctance and inductance matrices are not guaranteed to be positive-definite. In this work, we propose a band matching method that enjoys two advantages: First, we exploit the elegant structure of the inverse of banded matrices so as to construct an approximate inductance matrix L<sup>~</sup> whose band entries match the band entries of original L, and whose inverse is a banded matrix. This approach yields a compact representation of both inductance and reluctance matrices. Second, we establish that the compact approximant L<sup>~</sup> is guaranteed to be positive-definite.

Process variations cause device performance parameters, such as current or output resistance, to acquire a probability distribution. Estimation of these distributions has been accomplished using Monte Carlo techniques so far. The large number of samples needed by Monte Carlo methods adversely affects the possibility of integrating probabilistic device performance at the circuit level due to run-time inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called forward discrete probability propagation (FDPP). This method discretizes the probability distributions and effectively propagates these probabilities across a device formula hierarchy, such as the one present in the SPICE3v3 model. Consequently, probability distributions for process parameters are propagated to the device level. It is shown in the paper that with far fewer number of samples, comparable accuracy to a Monte Carlo method is achieved.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466162","","Character generation;Circuits;Computational modeling;Computer science;Design engineering;Gaussian distribution;Monte Carlo methods;Probability distribution;Random number generation;Runtime","Monte Carlo methods;SPICE;semiconductor device models;statistical distributions","Monte Carlo methods;SPICE3v3 model;device formula hierarchy;device performance characterization;forward discrete probability propagation;probabilistic device performance;probability distribution;process variations;runtime inefficiency","","4","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Encoding the unobservability of logic blocks accelerated the SAT-solving of Boolean formulas from formal verification of complex microprocessors, while allowing us to use a conventional CNF-based SAT-solver. On unsatisfiable CNF formulas, best was the strategy of merging logic blocks with adjacent gates on the only path from the block output to the primary output, with a resulting speedup of up to 16x for CNF formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables, millions of clauses, and tens of millions of literals. Furthermore, the speedup is relative to an already very efficient Boolean-to-CNF translation. On satisfiable CNF formulas, best was the strategy of merging logic blocks with leaf gates and with adjacent gates on the only path to the primary output, as well as exploiting the polarity of gates and logic blocks to reduce the number of their clauses.

The gridless routing is much more difficult than the grid-based one because the solution space of gridless routing is significantly larger than that of grid-based one. In this paper, we present the first multilevel, full-chip gridless detailed router. The router integrates global routing, detailed routing, and congestion estimation together at each level of the multilevel routing. It can handle non-uniform wire widths and consider routability and optical proximity correction (OPC). Experimental results show that our approach obtains significantly better routing solutions than previous works. For example, for a set of 11 commonly used benchmark circuits, our approach achieves 100% routing completion for all circuits while the famous state-of-the-art three-level routing and multilevel routing (multilevel global routing + flat detailed routing) cannot complete routing for any of the circuits. Besides, experimental results show that our multilevel gridless router can handle non-uniform wire widths efficiently and effectively (still maintain 100% routing completion for all circuits). In particular, our OPC-aware multilevel gridless router archives an average reduction of 11.3% pattern features and still maintains 100% routability for the 11 benchmark circuits.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466547","","Circuit simulation;Costs;Design engineering;Large-scale systems;Routing;Scalability;Simulated annealing;Tiles;Very large scale integration;Wire","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing","benchmark circuits;congestion estimation;detailed routing;global routing;multilevel full-chip gridless routing;nanometer effects;optical proximity correction;variable wire widths;wire spacings","","9","","33","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proposed scheme employs CBLSA, equalizer transistor and 1T1MTJ array structure. This method has very excellent bit-line clamping characteristic and overall memory can be designed a simple architecture using current mode sensing. As a result, proposed memory structure can clamp a bit-line voltage under 0.15V and it uses very small power and area. This lower bit-line voltage promises more stable data accessing in MRAM.

SAGA minimizes both the energy consumption and area of the design by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a detailed analysis of the quality of the results and the solution times of the proposed technique by extensive experimentation with realistic benchmarks and comparisons with optimal MILP solutions. SAGA is able to generate solutions that are as good as the optimal solutions produced by the MILP formulation. Whereas the MILP formulation run time rises exponentially for even moderately sized graphs, SAGA generates solutions for large graphs in reasonable time.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466212","","Design optimization;Energy consumption;Genetic algorithms;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network synthesis;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","circuit simulation;genetic algorithms;network synthesis;system-on-chip","MILP formulation;SAGA;communication trace graph;custom NoC topology;energy consumption;genetic algorithm;guaranteed throughput NoC architectures;guaranteed throughput traffic;interconnection network architecture elements;multi-objective optimization problem;network synthesis;network-on-chip;optimal MILP solutions","","4","","9","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implemented the approach in hardware, which we call PBA unit (PBAU), using Verilog HDL and verified the runtime complexity. PBAU is an intellectual property (IP) block that provides a mechanism of very fast, automatic deadlock avoidance for a multiprocessor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC, which we predict will be the mainstream of future high performance computing environments). Moreover, our PBA supports multiple-instance multiple resource systems. We demonstrate that PBAU not only avoids deadlock in a few clock cycles (1600× faster than the banker's algorithm in software) but also achieves in a particular example a 19% speedup of application execution time over avoiding deadlock in software. Lastly, the MPSoC area overhead due to PBAU is small, under 0.05% in our candidate MPSoC example.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466583","","Application software;Clocks;Hardware design languages;High performance computing;Intellectual property;Multiprocessing systems;Runtime;Software algorithms;System recovery;System-on-a-chip","computational complexity;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers);parallel algorithms;system-on-chip","MPSoC;PBA unit;PBAU;automatic deadlock avoidance;best-case run-time;intellectual property block;multiple-instance multiple resource systems;multiprocessor system-on-a-chip;parallel banker algorithm;run-time complexity","","1","","17","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BFL algorithm is the most effective counterexample minimization algorithm compared to all other approaches, but its run time overhead is very large due to one call to SAT solver per candidate variable to be eliminated. So we propose a faster counterexample minimization algorithm based on refutation analysis and incremental SAT. First, for every UNSAT instance of BFL, we perform refutation analysis to extract the set of variables that lead to UNSAT, all variables not belong to this set can be eliminated simultaneously. In this way, we can eliminate many variables with only one call to SAT solver. At the same time, we employ incremental SAT approach to share learned clauses between similar instances of BFL, to prevent overlapped state space from being searched repeatedly. Theoretic analysis and experiment result shows that, our approach can be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than BFL, and still retain the minimization ability of BFL (Ravi and Somenzi, 2004).","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466205","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Data mining;Hardware;Minimization methods;Performance analysis;Production systems;Software systems;Space technology;State-space methods","computability;minimisation of switching nets","BFL algorithm;SAT solver;UNSAT;bounded model checking;brute force lifting;counterexample minimization;incremental SAT;refutation analysis","","3","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since macrocells, IP blocks, and prerouted nets are often regarded as obstacles in the routing phase, obstacle-avoiding RSMT (OARSMT) algorithms are useful for practical routing applications. This paper focuses on the OARSMT problem and presents an algorithm, named An-OARSMan, based on ant colony optimization. A greedy obstacle penalty distance (OP-distance) local heuristic is used in the algorithm and performed on the track graph. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on different kinds of obstacles. Experimental results show that An-OARSMan can handle complex obstacle cases including both convex and concave polygon obstacles with good length performance. It can always achieve the optimal solution in the cases with no more than 7 terminals.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466120","","Ant colony optimization;Computer science;Delay estimation;Large scale integration;Mathematics;Polynomials;Routing;Steiner trees;Testing;Wire","ULSI;VLSI;integrated circuit design;network routing;trees (mathematics)","An-OARSMan;IP blocks;ULSI physical design;VLSI physical design;ant colony optimization;concave polygon obstacles;convex polygon obstacles;greedy obstacle penalty distance;obstacle avoiding routing tree construction;obstacle-avoiding RSMT algorithms;rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction","","12","","16","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One algorithm called MiLa targets at minimizing the latency, and the other algorithm called GiLa aims to find a feasible solution subject to given latency constraints imposed on sinks. However, they both do not consider the case where buffer/flip-flop blockages are present. In this paper, we enhance the MiLa algorithm and GiLa algorithm to consider blockage avoidance by finding alternative registered-buffered paths between each internal node inside a blockage and its parent node. The experimental results show that in comparison to the MiLa algorithm, our approach is able to find a solution with the same latency (for about half of the test cases) or even better latency (for the remaining test cases) and the same wirelength, while the buffer/flip-flop usage and CPU time are comparable or acceptable. In comparison to the GiLa algorithm, our approach is able to find a feasible solution for each test case while the Gila algorithm fails to do so for several test cases.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466122","","Binary trees;Capacitance;Clocks;Delay effects;Flip-flops;Libraries;Pins;Routing;Testing","buffer circuits;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;network routing;trees (mathematics)","GiLa algorithm;MiLa algorithm;adaptive blockage avoidance;buffer blockages;buffer insertion;concurrent flip-flop;flip-flop blockages;latency constraints;multipin net;registered-buffered paths;routing tree;van Ginneken algorithm","","0","","6","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed fault tolerant processor architecture not only guarantees the correctness of computation but also is flexible in that it dynamically trades-off computation resources and performance. The core of the architecture is a decentralized instruction control unit called the voter that achieves both fault tolerance and the maximum parallel execution of instructions by exploiting the abundant computational resources provided by nanotechnologies. Although the result of each instruction needs to be confirmed by executing it on multiple computation units, multiple unconfirmed instructions can proceed as speculative branches. The voter implements a hardware-frugal computation unit allocation algorithm to organize the redundant computations and to dynamically control the growth of speculative branches.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466180","","CMOS technology;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;High performance computing;Nanoscale devices;Redundancy;System performance","fault tolerant computing;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;redundancy","fault tolerant processor architecture;fault-tolerant computation model;hardware-frugal computation unit allocation;nanoelectronic processor architecture;parallel instruction execution;redundant computations;speculative branches;time varying fault rates","","3","2","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first observe that the state probabilities of nodes in a circuit tend to be skewed, meaning that they have either a high or a low value. We then propose a method that exploits these skewed state probabilities by setting only those transistors to high-K, (thick-oxide) that have a high likelihood of being off (on) and hence contributing significantly to the total runtime leakage. Accordingly, we also propose a library specifically tailored for the proposed approach, where V<sub>t</sub> and T<sub>ox</sub> assignment with favorably trade-offs under skewed input probabilities are provided.

The paper describes two different configurable logic block (CLB) architectures that could he used to implement the proposed SEU detection technique. Of the two, the first architecture can perform at-speed testing of the LUTs without interrupting the normal functioning of the FPGA. The second one works by switching the CLBs from normal-mode to testing-mode and vice-versa. The LUTs are tested in the testing-mode. The switching frequency can be externally programmed and hence varied depending on the rate of SEU occurrences. Both the proposed architectures were compared with the Xilinx Virtex and Virtex Pro architecture. The proposed architectures require only 2 (when compared with Virtex) and 4 (when compared with Virtex Pro) additional SRAM configuration bits per LUT.

We start with any traditional FSM synthesis and optimization procedure; then reconstruct a functionally equivalent but topologically different FSM based on the optimization objective; and conclude with another round of FSM synthesis and optimization (can be the same procedure) on the newly constructed FSM. This allows us to explore a larger solution space that includes synthesis solutions to the functionally equivalent FSMs instead of only the original FSM, making it possible to obtain solutions better than the optimal ones for the original FSM. Guided by the result of the first round FSM synthesis, the solution space exploration process can be rapid and cost-efficient. To demonstrate this framework, we develop a genetic algorithm and a fast heuristic to reengineer a low power state encoding procedure POW3 (Benini and Micheli, 1995). On average, POW3 can reduce the switching activity by 12% over nonpower-driven state encoding schemes on the MCNC FSM benchmarks. We then reengineer these benchmarks by the proposed genetic algorithm and heuristic respectively. When we apply POW3 to the reengineered FSMs, we observe an additional 8.9% and 6.0% switching activity reduction. This translates to an average of 7.9% energy reduction with little area increase. Finally, we obtain the optimal low power coding for benchmarks of small size from an integer linear programming formulation. We find that the POW3-encoded original FSMs are 27.0% worse than the optimal, but this number drops to 6.7% when we apply POW3 to the reengineered FSMs.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466169","","Automata;Educational institutions;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Logic testing;Minimization;Power dissipation;Space exploration;Switching circuits","encoding;finite state machines;genetic algorithms;integer programming;linear programming;logic design;low-power electronics","FSM synthesis;energy reduction;finite state machine reengineering;genetic algorithm;integer linear programming;low power state encoding;nonpower-driven state encoding;optimization procedure;performance enhancement framework;switching activity reduction","","3","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bus architecture displays several advantages such as, high bandwidth, low latency, and low performance penalty from arbitration delay, all of which make it more scalable than traditional buses. However, its scalability may be limited by the bus access logic delay. As a module is connected to the bus through its interface unit, which is connected in series on the bus, the bus logic delay increases linearly as the bus size increases. In this paper, we propose to increase the scalability of SAMBA buses through two methods: control signal lookahead and module clustering. The control signal lookahead technique can determine the bus access control signal in advance, thereby reducing the effective delay of each interface unit. Module clustering, on the other hand, can reduce the number of interface units attached to a bus. Experimental results show that combining these two methods can effectively reduce the bus logic delay, and thus increase the scalability of SAMBA buses.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466548","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466548","","Access control;Bandwidth;Circuit testing;Delay effects;Delay lines;Displays;Logic;Multiplexing;Scalability;System-on-a-chip","delays;integrated circuit design;system buses;system-on-chip","SAMBA bus;bus access control signal;bus access logic delay;bus architecture;bus scalability;bus size;control signal lookahead;module clustering;multiple transactions;single-winner bus arbitration","","3","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, hybrid structures of H-tree and mesh were proposed to distribute the clock signal with a balanced H-tree and lock the skew using the shunt effect of the mesh. However, in multi-giga hertz regime, the RC model (Orshansky et al., 2002) of the mesh is no longer valid. The inductance effect of the mesh can even make the skew worse. In this paper, we investigate the use of a novel architecture which incorporates multiple level transmission line shunts to distribute global clock signal. We derive the analytical expression of the skew reduction contributed by the shunt of a transmission line with the length of an integral multiple of clock wavelength. Based on the analytical skew expression, we adopt convex programming techniques to optimize the wire widths of the multi-level transmission line network. Simulation results show that the multilevel network achieves below 4ps skew for 10GHz clock rate.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466139","","Clocks;Computer science;Fluctuations;Frequency synchronization;Inductance;Oscillators;Power transmission lines;Spirals;Transmission lines;Wire","clocks;convex programming;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;transmission lines","H-tree;RC model;analytical skew expression;clock rate;clock signal;clock skew;clock wavelength;convex programming;hybrid structures;mesh inductance effect;mesh shunt effect;multigiga hertz clock distribution;multilevel transmission line network;multiple level transmission line shunts;skew reduction;wire width optimization","","0","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The decomposition of a function is desirable for several reasons. First, it's a method to obtain a multiple-level implementation of a function. It leads to a partition in simpler blocks that easily results in smaller areas and fewer interconnects. Moreover, it exposes a parallelism in the computation of the function that can be exploited by hardware as well as during simulation. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, STACCATO, that generates a DSD decomposition starting from the BDD of a function. STACCATO is novel because: 1) it provides a complete description of each decomposition, that is, it computes the ""kernel"" function K relating the elements of each decomposition; and 2) it has better performance than previously known algorithms.

Fault detection can only be accurately determined by exploring the set of all control flow paths, which may be traversed as a result of a fault. We present a coverage metric that determines the propagation of fault effects along all possible faulty control flow paths. The complexity of exploring multiple control flow paths is greatly alleviated by heuristically pruning infeasible control flow paths using the algorithm that we present.

Resource sharing addresses this challenge. In this paper, we propose resource sharing techniques that can be incorporated into an automated synthesis flow to generate pipelined designs. Given a synthesized pipelined design, we create a direct relationship between available time slack on modules and the multiplexing overhead due to sharing. This flexibility is maximally exploited without violating any throughput constraints. We propose different techniques to address resource sharing problems of varying restrictions. Specifically, we propose an optimal algorithm for constant-slack resource sharing and a heuristic for the general intrapipeline stage resource sharing. On an average the demand on arithmetic functional units can be reduced by 39.5% for a set of benchmarks from the multimedia domain using our resource sharing technique.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466464","","Arithmetic;Cost function;Delay effects;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Heuristic algorithms;Pipeline processing;Resource management;Throughput","algorithm theory;data flow graphs;field programmable gate arrays;pipeline arithmetic","FPGA;arithmetic functional units;constant-slack resource sharing;intrapipeline stage resource sharing;multimedia domain;optimal algorithm;pipelined CDFG synthesis;synthesized pipelined design","","0","","11","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As PLL malfunction is one of the most important factors in re-fabs of SoCs, fast simulation of PLLs to capture non-ideal behavior accurately is an immediate, pressing need in the semiconductor design industry. In this paper, we present a nonlinear macro model based PLL simulation technique that is considerably more accurate than prior linear PLL simulation techniques. Our method is able to accurately capture transient behavior and faithfully estimate timing jitter in noisy PLLs. We demonstrate the proposed technique on ring and LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based PLLs, and compare results against linear PLL macromodels and full SPICE-level simulation. We show that, unlike prior linear macromodel based approaches, the proposed nonlinear technique captures the dynamics of complex phenomena such as locking, cycle slipping and power supply noise induced PLL jitter, replicating qualitative features from full SPICE simulations accurately while providing speedups of over two orders of magnitude.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466207","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Filters;Frequency;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Predictive models;SPICE;Semiconductor device noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","SPICE;circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise;phase locked loops;timing jitter;voltage-controlled oscillators","LC voltage-controlled oscillator;PLL simulation;SPICE-level simulation;cycle slipping;loop nonidealities;nonlinear VCO macromodels;nonlinear macro model;phase-locked loops;power supply noise;semiconductor design industry;timing jitter;transient behavior","","9","","16","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many real-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce energy consumption in hard real-time embedded systems that use dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) capable processors. This paper explores an algorithm that seeks to reduce energy consumption by considering tasks in tandem, with the intuition that what may be a good frequency for one task, may be much worse for another. In particular, our algorithm considers pairs of tasks, and optimizes them simultaneously so that their total energy consumption is minimized while all deadlines are met. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to effectively improve on the results of look-ahead EDF, one of the best energy-aware schedulers, especially for task sets with moderate utilization, and ""harmonious"" task periodicity.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466473","","Batteries;Dynamic voltage scaling;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Frequency;Heuristic algorithms;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Voltage control","optimisation;processor scheduling;real-time systems","dynamic voltage scaling algorithm;energy consumption reduction;energy reduction;energy-aware schedulers;hard real-time systems;task optimization;total energy consumption minimization","","1","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we study functional unit binding (or module assignment) given a scheduled data flow graph under a dual-V<sub>dd</sub> framework. We assume that each functional unit can be driven by a low V<sub>dd</sub> or a high V<sub>dd</sub> dynamically during run time to save dynamic power. We develop a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for assigning low V<sub>dd</sub> to as many operations as possible under the resource and time constraint, and in the same time minimizing total switching activity through functional unit binding. Our algorithm shows consistent improvement over a design flow that separates voltage assignment from functional unit binding. We also change the initial scheduling to examine power-latency tradeoff scenarios. Experimental results show that we can achieve a 21% power reduction when latency bound is tight. When latency is relaxed by 10 to 100%, the power reduction is 31 to 73% compared to the synthesis results for the case of single high V<sub>dd</sub> without latency relaxation. We also show comparison data of energy consumption under the same experimental setting.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466475","","Circuits;Computer science;Delay;Energy consumption;Flow graphs;High level synthesis;Partial response channels;Polynomials;Processor scheduling;Voltage","circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;data flow graphs;high level synthesis;low-power electronics;polynomials","dual-V<sub>dd</sub> framework;functional unit binding;high-level synthesis;latency relaxation;optimal module assignment;optimal voltage assignment;polynomial-time optimal algorithm;power consumption reduction;power-latency tradeoff;scheduled data flow graph;total switching activity minimization","","2","","26","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new quality of the partitioning solution, crowdedness, is defined as a virtual complexity metric where the physical size and the local connectivity of a partitioned block are considered simultaneously in the form of a weighted sum. The partitioning solutions driven by overall cut quality minimization tend to have wide variances of local interconnections for different blocks. The difference of block sizes, combining with the variance of the interconnections, potentially leads to the significant imbalance of the crowdedness (equivalently. resource utilization), even though the feasibility imposed by a block-size constraint is satisfied. Using the crowdedness metric, we explore the new partitioning solution space where the local interconnections are adaptively adjusted according to the block sizes, still under the same objective of overall interconnections minimization. By the carefully designed prioritized cell move policy, the proposed crowdedness-based partitioning achieves near-optimal solutions in terms of resource utilization distribution, while the overall interconnection quality also is improved but the feasibility is barely violated. The proposed approach is practically beneficial to multi-FPGA applications, in which excessive interconnections for a FPGA generate additional logics inside of the FPGA.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466199","","Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Joining processes;Logic;Mice;Minimization;Resource management;Routing","circuit optimisation;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;logic partitioning","block-size constraint;crowdedness balanced multilevel partitioning;cut quality minimization;interconnections minimization;local connectivity;logic occupation;multi-FPGA applications;partitioned block;resource utilization distribution;uniform resource utilization;virtual complexity metric","","0","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work develops a bitwidth-aware synthesis flow, including bitwidth analysis, scheduling and binding, and register allocation and binding, to exploit the multi-bitwidth nature of operations and variables for area-efficient designs. We also develop lower bound estimation to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed solutions for register allocation and binding.

In this paper, we are going to prove that mutual partial reluctance effect between a completely shielded short conductor segment and a conductor segment outside the shield is zero, which implies that the partial reluctance effect is local. Also, an iterative cutting algorithm is proposed to guarantee the strong diagonal dominance of the partial reluctance matrix, which is a sufficient condition for the partial reluctance matrix to be positive definite.

Practically, we propose a hierarchical multi-point reduction scheme for high-fidelity, wideband modeling of general passive or active linear circuits.

This paper presents a pseudo-functional test methodology that attempts to minimize the over-testing problem of the scan-based circuits for the delay faults. The first pattern of a two-pattern test is still delivered by scan in the test mode but the pattern is generated in such a way that it does not violate the functional constraints extracted from the functional logic. In this paper, we use a SAT solver to extract a set of functional constraints which consists of illegal states and internal signal correlation. Along with the functional justification (also called broad-side) test application scheme, the functional constraints are imposed to a commercial delay-fault ATPG tool to generate pseudo-functional delay tests. The experimental results indicate that the percentage of untestable delay faults is non-trivial for many circuits which support the hypothesis of the over-testing problem in delay testing.

Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) traditional logic synthesis applies literal count as the primary quality metric during the technology independent optimization phase. This simplistic metric often leads to poor circuit structures as it cannot foresee the impact of early choices on the final area, delay, power consumption, etc. (2) Although powerful, global Boolean optimization is not robust and corresponding algorithms cannot be used in practice without artificially restricting the application window. Other techniques, such as algebraic methods scale well but provide weaker optimization power. To address both problems, we use randomized search that is based on a simple circuit graph representation and a complete set of local transformations that include algebraic and Boolean optimization steps. The objective of the search process can be tuned to complex cost functions, combining area, timing, mutability, and power. Our experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate the significant potential of the presented approach.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466508","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Cost function;Delay;Energy consumption;Logic;Optimization methods;Robustness;Simulated annealing;Timing","Boolean functions;logic programming;simulated annealing","Boolean optimization;algebraic methods;algebraic optimization;circuit graph representation;circuit structures;cost functions;local transformations;logic optimization;logic synthesis approach;optimization power;power consumption;primary quality metric;rule-based randomized search;simulated annealing;technology independent optimization phase","","0","","12","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is also frequently a need to express a preference for certain solutions. Extending SAT-solving to Boolean optimization allows the use of objective functions to describe a desirable solution. Although recent work in 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) offers extensions that can optimize a linear objective function, this is often achieved by solving a series of SAT or ILP decision problems. Our work articulates some pitfalls of this approach. An objective function may complicate the use of any symmetry that might be present in the given constraints, even when the constraints are unsatisfiable and the objective function is irrelevant. We propose several new techniques that treat objective functions differently from CNF/PB constraints and accelerate Boolean optimization in many practical cases. We also develop an adaptive flow that analyzes a given Boolean optimization problem and picks the symmetry-breaking technique that is best suited to the problem characteristics. Empirically, we show that for non-trivial objective functions that destroy constraint symmetries, the benefit of static symmetry-breaking is lost but dynamic symmetry-breaking accelerates problem-solving in many cases. We also introduce a new objective function, localized bit selection (LBS), that can be used to specify a preference for bit values in formal verification applications.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466204","","Acceleration;Automatic test pattern generation;Constraint optimization;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Formal verification;Lead;Microprocessors;Problem-solving;Routing","Boolean functions;computability;formal verification;integer programming;linear programming","0-1 integer linear programming;Boolean optimization;Boolean satisfiability solving;CNF/PB constraints;SAT solving;decision problems;dynamic symmetry breaking;formal verification;linear objective function;localized bit selection;pseudo-Boolean constraints","","0","","14","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is different from the standard look-up table (LUT) based CLB architectures available in commercial FPGAs. The new function generation architecture is based on the fact that a small set of k-input Boolean functions can generate all the 2<sup>2k</sup>, k-input Boolean functions using a simple mapping technique. The area required by the new function generation architecture is 58.6% lesser than the area required by a standard 16×1 LUT used in commercial FPGAs. In addition, the proposed architecture consumes 40.8% lesser power than the standard 16×1 LUT. The routing architecture for the proposed reconfigurable system is the same as those present in current-day FPGAs. Hence, the algorithms presently used for technology mapping, packing, placement and routing on FPGAs can be used for the proposed reconfigurable system without much modification. The new architecture requires a 10% increase in the SRAM configuration memory. This is an insignificant penalty in comparison to the reduction in the area of the FPGA and power consumption, achieved by the proposed CLB architecture.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466486","","Boolean functions;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic arrays;Logic functions;Multiplexing;Random access memory;Routing;Table lookup","Boolean functions;field programmable gate arrays;function generators;reconfigurable architectures;table lookup","Boolean functions;CLB architecture;FPGA;SRAM configuration memory;function generation architecture;mapping technique;power consumption;reconfigurable system;routing architecture;standard look-up table;technology mapping","","0","","11","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In MTCMOS circuits, during the switchings between the active and standby modes, sudden surges in current happens due to floating voltages at the nodes. These surges might violate the reliability of the circuit. In this paper we address the above problem by developing wake-up strategies to control these current surges as the circuit is getting turned on. Through gradually turning on a circuit a smaller current will be drawn from the power-grid network. A novel partitioning technique is proposed for MTCMOS circuits under a given constraint of maximum drawn-current from the power-grid network. Two approaches are proposed in this paper; the optimal ILP-based formulation and a polynomial-time heuristic. Experimental results show that up to 90.7% improvement in peak drawn-current is obtained with a maximum of 4 clock cycles time to turn on the circuit. Also result show the effectiveness of the heuristic in terms of the quality of solution and a run-time of up to 6600 times faster than the ILP approach for larger circuits.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466478","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Clocks;Educational institutions;Polynomials;Power grids;Power supplies;Protocols;Surges;Turning","CMOS digital integrated circuits;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit noise;logic CAD;logic partitioning;polynomials;switched mode power supplies","MTCMOS circuits;MTCMOS-based technology;current surge control;maximum drawn-current;optimal ILP-based formulation;partitioning technique;polynomial-time heuristic;power-grid network;sudden current surges;switching modes;wake-up noise;wake-up protocols","","3","1","7","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to strike a balance between two extremes - pure compiler-based scheme (i.e., user-transparent approach) and pure user-based scheme (i.e., assembly programming). In particular, we defend a strategy where a few programmer-inserted hints can enable the compiler to do much better job than the pure compiler approach without requiring the programmer to encode low-level optimizations.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466149","","Application software;Assembly;Computer science;Embedded software;Embedded system;Failure analysis;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Programming profession;Runtime","embedded systems;optimisation;optimising compilers;program assemblers","application code;assembly programming;compiler analysis;embedded applications optimization;low-level optimizations;optimizing compiler;programmer-inserted hints;pure compiler-based scheme;pure user-based scheme","","1","","6","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a systematic analysis method can be very useful to designers as they will be able to determine how the deskewing network behaves, thus, avoiding repeated simulations.

This results in large slack times wasted in those cycles with faster operations. To reduce the wasted times multi-cycle and chaining techniques have been employed. The scheduling algorithm presented in this paper goes one step further. It breaks up some of the specification operations and schedule several data-dependent operation fragments in the same cycle. In consequence, some of the specification operations are executed during several cycles (non-necessarily consecutive ones), and in every execution cycle some result bits are calculated. Thus the execution of one operation may start even if its predecessors have not finished yet. In the experimental results carried out, the proposed algorithm improves circuit performance above 70% on average, with slight increments in the datapath area.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466513","","Circuit optimization;Clocks;Costs;Delay;Flow graphs;High level synthesis;Pipeline processing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;System performance","processor scheduling","arrival time aware scheduling;chaining techniques;circuit performance;clock cycle duration;clock cycle length minimization;data-dependent operation;execution cycle;execution time;multicycle techniques;scheduling algorithms;specification operations","","0","","11","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first obtain the acyclic implementation of the given set of Boolean functions. Then using a branch-and-bound heuristic, we generate cyclic circuits that are to be checked for combinationality. Unlike earlier complex methods for combinationality check, our approach is to check whether this cyclic circuit is functionally equivalent to the acyclic circuit obtained earlier.

The method employs two techniques: scan polarity adjustment and pinpoint test relaxation. Given a test set for a full-scan circuit, scan polarity adjustment selectively flips the values of some scan cells in test patterns. It can be realized by changing connections between two scan cells so that the inverted output of a scan cell, Q, is connected to the next scan cell. Pinpoint test relaxation flips some specified 1s in the test patterns to 0s without any fault coverage loss. Both techniques are applied by referring to a gain-penalty table to determine scan cells or bits to be flipped. Experimental results on ISCAS' 89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method could reduce test data volume by 36%. Switching activities, i.e. test power during scan testing, were also reduced.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466130","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Electronic equipment testing;Electronic mail;Encoding;Hardware;Logic testing;System testing;System-on-a-chip","encoding;integrated circuit testing;logic testing","fault coverage loss;full-scan circuit;gain-penalty table;pinpoint test relaxation;run-length based encoding;scan cells;scan circuits;scan polarity adjustment;scan testing;switching activities;test compression;test patterns;test power","","1","","23","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Delay penalties from both coupling capacitance and wire detour are considered in a unified graph model. The core problem is formulated and solved as a sequential ordering problem (SOP).

If this model is not accurate enough on the validation data, the grid is split into equal sized smaller grids. On each of these grids, a local model is built using samples on this grid and its neighboring and validated similarly. A grid will not be further refined only if the corresponding local model is accurate on its validation data set.

The reduction in power dissipation can be achieved through reducing the bus switching activity. Not only is the switching activity in individual lines reduced but so is the coupling activity across the adjacent lines, the major contributor to the overall power dissipation in deep submicron technology. Detailed analysis of crosstalk noise and delay shows that eliminating certain patterns of transitions and reducing the infeasible ones in terms of crosstalk noise and power dissipation is a feasible strategy for alleviating these problems. We propose an encoding technique consisting of the use of predefined patterns of transitions, one for each possible combination of input data, to generate the codewords. The restriction to the predefined patterns of transitions enables fast encoding and low hardware overhead. This work presents an extensive analysis of the consequent reduction in crosstalk and power. SPICE derived experimental results show a reduction in worst case crosstalk delay and noise, ranging up to 24% and 10% respectively. Extensive experimental results for various applications show significant reduction in power dissipation ranging up to 44% for switching activity on the bus lines and up to 25% for coupling activity. The results also show a drastic reduction ranging up to 98% in the number of patterns that are most likely to produce crosstalk errors.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466445","","Capacitors;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Embedded system;Encoding;Fault detection;Hardware;Noise reduction;Pattern analysis;Power dissipation","SPICE;crosstalk;delays;encoding;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit noise;microprocessor chips","SPICE;bus lines;bus switching activity;codewords;coupling activity;crosstalk delay;crosstalk errors;crosstalk noise;deep submicron technology;encoding technique;fault vulnerability;general-purpose applications;power dissipation;predefined patterns;processor buses;unified transformational approach","","6","","17","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper defines a relation termed as split-equivalence between logical functions. Using this relation, a single look-up table (LUT) storing the truth table of a function F may be used to generate other functions that are split-equivalent to F resulting in an overall reduction in the logic area used to map the circuit on the FPGA. This paper proposes a new configurable logic block (CLB) architecture containing a single LUT that stores the truth table of a Boolean function F and is capable of generating three split-equivalent functions of F. Given a set of Boolean functions to be mapped onto LUTs, the technique proposed identifies sets of four functions such that any three of them are split-equivalent to the fourth. These sets are mapped on to the proposed CLB architecture. The proposed CLB architecture was compared with the standard CLBs available on Xilinx Virtex architecture and it was found that the former occupies 26% lesser area than the latter with a small increase in the SRAM configuration bits required to configure a CLB.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466462","","Boolean functions;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic circuits;Random access memory;Reconfigurable logic;Table lookup","Boolean functions;SRAM chips;algorithm theory;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;table lookup","Boolean function F;SRAM-based FPGAs;Xilinx Virtex architecture;circuit packing algorithm;configurable logic block architecture;logic-area reduction;look-up table;split-equivalent functions;truth table","","2","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the compaction obtains an optimal area it may not be good to meet other objectives such as minimizing total wire length which is the first-order objective. It is not known in the literature how to place blocks to obtain an optimal wire length. In this paper, we first show that the problem can be formulated as linear programming. Thereafter, instead of using the general but slow linear programming, we propose an efficient min-cost flow based approach to solve it. Our approach guarantees to obtain the minimum of total wire length in polynomial time and meanwhile keep the minimum area by distributing white space smarter for a given floorplan topology. We also show that the approach can be easily extended to handle constraints such as fixed-frame (fixed area), IO pins, pre-placed blocks, boundary blocks, range placement, alignment and abutment, rectilinear blocks, soft blocks, one-dimensional cluster placement, and bounded net delay, without loss of optimality. Practically, the algorithm is so efficient in that it finishes in less than 0.4 seconds for all MCNC benchmarks of block placement. It is also very effective. Experimental results show we can improve 4.2% of wire length even on very compact floorplans.

Our approach is motivated by maximization of task mobilities in that the increase of mobilities may raise the possibility of assigning tasks to low-voltage components. The mobility means the ability to schedule the starting time of a task. It is defined as the distance between its as-late-as-possible (ALAP) schedule time and its as-soon-as-possible (ASAP) schedule time. To earn task mobilities, we use loop shrinking, retiming and unfolding techniques. The loop shrinking can first reduce the iteration period bound (IPB) and, then, the others are employed for shortening the minimum achieved sample period (MASP) as much as possible. The minimization of MASP results in high task mobilities. Thereafter, we can assign tasks with high mobilities to low-voltage components and minimize energy dissipation under resource and latency constraints. With considering the overhead of level conversion, our approach can achieve significant power reduction. For instance, as the experimental results, we can save the power consumption up to 54.77% for the case of the third-order IIR filter.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466479","","Capacitance;Control engineering;Delay;Digital signal processing;Energy consumption;Energy dissipation;High level synthesis;Low voltage;Minimization;Processor scheduling","circuit complexity;circuit optimisation;high level synthesis;low-power electronics;processor scheduling","ALAP schedule time;ASAP schedule time;algorithmic transformation techniques;as-late-as-possible schedule time;as-soon-as-possible schedule time;iteration period bound reduction;loop shrinking techniques;low power DSP applications;low power circuit;low-voltage components;minimum achieved sample period;multiple voltage scheduling;multiple-voltage high-level synthesis methodology;power reduction;retiming techniques;task mobilities;task scheduling;unfolding techniques","","2","","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DAC '07. 44th ACM/IEEE","20070625","2007","","","459","464","Design for low power has become a key requirement in today's SoC design, especially for mobile applications. Multi-Vdd is an effective method to reduce both leakage and dynamic power. In a multi-Vdd design, cells of different supply voltages are often grouped into a small number of voltage islands, in order to avoid complex power supply system and excessive amount of level shifters. Recently, Wu et al. (2005) proposed an elegant algorithm for voltage island grouping based on the physical proximity of the critical cells in a post- placement voltage assignment, and Wu et al. (2006) proposed an efficient algorithm for voltage assignment which not only meets timing but also forms good proximity of the critical cells. However, due to insufficient slack, a few isolated critical cells (called outliers) may still exist in the resulting voltage assignment, causing disproportionately expensive penalty to the final voltage island grouping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the voltage assignment by automatic outlier detection followed by incremental placement. The outlier detection is based on a modified algorithm for the facility location problem. The incremental placement is guided by setting proper constraints on the paths containing the detected outliers, such that the outliers can be eliminated later. Our experiments on industry designs show that our algorithm leads to 12% - 54% improvement in the final voltage island grouping, with quick turn around time.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261228","Algorithms;Design;Low power;Outlier;Placement;Voltage assignment","Algorithm design and analysis;Contracts;Costs;Delay;Design optimization;Low voltage;Power supplies;Routing;Timing","logic design;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","SoC design;facility location;incremental placement;low power design;mobile application;multiVdd design;outlier detection;supply voltage;voltage assignment;voltage island grouping","","2","","10","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, it only requires a simpler, pure quadratic objective function in the spirit of [8,10,23]. Experimental results show that RQL outperforms all available academic placers on the ISPD-2005 placement contest benchmarks. In particular, RQL obtains an average wire- length improvement of 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.4%, 8.5%, and 14.6% versus mPL6 [5], NTUPlaceS [7], Kraflwerk [20], APlace2.0 [11], and Capo10.2 [18], respectively.

A procedure is introduced to reduce the diagnosis and structural test time from quadratic to linear using the proposed DFT hardware. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed technique, principal component analysis is used to create virtual process variations to simulate in lieu of semiconductor fabrication data. An architecture specific soft fault model is suggested for the diagnosis problem. Random errors according to the fault model are introduced in the virtual test environment on top of the process variations and it is shown that diagnosis of a fault is possible with high accuracy with the proposed method. The same technique employing principal component analysis is furthermore used to provide process variation-aware reference test comparison values for a structural test of the DAC. The structural test provides a mechanism to test for even unmodeled manufacturing faults. The process variation-aware test values help detect defects even under process variations. The proposed DFT hardware and method are low cost and quite suitable for a built-in self diagnosis and test implementation.","","1-59593-058-2","","10.1109/DAC.2005.193934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510454","","Analytical models;Controllability;Design for testability;Digital-analog conversion;Fabrication;Fault diagnosis;Hardware;Manufacturing;Principal component analysis;Testing","automatic test pattern generation;built-in self test;design for testability;digital-analogue conversion;fault simulation;integrated circuit testing;principal component analysis","built-in self diagnosis;design for test hardware;design for testability;digital to analog converter;fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;process variation-aware structural test;process variation-aware test values;semiconductor fabrication data;soft fault model;structural test time;test implementation;thermometer coded current steering DAC;virtual process variations;virtual test environment","","1","","","","","13-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are many opportunities for greater efficiency through integrated design and management of data center components. To that end, we propose a sustainable data center that replaces conventional resource delivery models with a framework centered around the supply and demand side management of all data center resources including IT, power and cooling. We have identified five elements for achieving this vision: data center scale lifecycle design, flexible and configurable building blocks, pervasive cross-layer sensing, knowledge discovery and visualization, and autonomous control.

We propose a global minimum clock network augmentation algorithm, which inserts links simultaneously between all nearest sink pairs, apply rule-based link removal, and perform link consolidation by Steiner minimum tree construction for wire-length reduction with guaranteed clock skew yield. Our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves dominant clock network augmentation solutions, e.g., an average of 16% clock skew yield improvement, 9% maximum skew reduction, and 25% reduction of clock skew variation standard deviation with identical wirelength compared with previous best clock network link insertion methods (Venkataraman et al., 2005).","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195991","","Capacitance;Clocks;Costs;Delay;Electronic mail;Energy consumption;Robustness;Routing;System performance;Very large scale integration","circuit CAD;clocks;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit yield;knowledge based systems;optimisation;trees (mathematics)","Steiner minimum tree construction;clock distribution network design;global minimum clock distribution network augmentation algorithm;guaranteed clock skew yield;link consolidation;link insertion;rule-based link removal;skew reduction;wire-length reduction with","","3","","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous node-merging techniques focus on replacing one node with an existing node in a circuit, but fail to replace a node that has no substitute node. To enhance the node-merging techniques on logic restructuring and optimization, we propose an NAR approach in this work. We first present two sufficient conditions that state the requirements of added nodes for safely replacing a target node. Then, an NAR approach is proposed to fast detect the added nodes by performing logic implications based on these conditions. We also apply the NAR approach to circuit minimization together with two techniques: redundancy removal and mandatory assignment reuse. We conduct experiments on a set of IWLS 2005 benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can enhance the state-of-the-art ATPG-based node-merging approach.
