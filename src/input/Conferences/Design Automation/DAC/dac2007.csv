Richard was also a strong supporter of the Design Automation Conference (DAC); he was the Chair of the conference in 1991, and gave a keynote address in 1995. He participated and chaired a half-dozen panels, and authored over 25 technical papers. His first paper appeared in the 1982 proceedings, and his research will continue to be used as a reference for many years to come. However, Richard's impact on DAC can not be so simply quantified. He was a leader and inspiration to everyone who participated in the conference for many years. And, he was instrumental in establishing and growing the essential relationship between the academic and industrial participants that make DAC a unique conference. As a community we are recognizing Richard's contributions and legacy in different ways. The Electronic Design Automation Consortium with friends and colleagues of Richard's have set up and funded an endowed professor chair at the Univ. of California, Berkeley. IEEE-CEDA together with ACM SIGDA have plans to award the A. Richard Newton Technical Impact Award in Electronic Design Automation to honor a person or persons for an outstanding technical contribution within the scope of electronic design automation. The DAC Executive Committee has also chosen to name our existing DAC Graduate Scholarships after Richard Newton. We feel that supporting young faculty and graduate research is an appropriate way to honor his vision and carry out some of his goals. For those young researchers who did not have the pleasure of knowing Richard personally, and are curious to learn about his work, they need look no further than the proceedings of the conference he helped shape to be inspired by the depth and breadth of his contributions to our field.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261116","","Newton, A.

As a result, the iterative interface design has been a time-consuming process. This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to designating pin-out for flip-chip BGA package when designing chipsets. The proposed approach can not only automate the assignment of more than 200 I/O pins on package, but also precisely evaluate package size which accommodates all pins with almost no void pin positions, as good as the one from manual design. Furthermore, the practical experience and techniques in designing such interface has been accounted for, including signal integrity, power delivery and routability. This efficient pin-out designation and package size estimation by pin-block design and floorplanning provides much faster turn around time, thus enormous improvement in meeting design schedule. The results on two real cases show that our methodology is effective in achieving almost the same dimensions in package size, compared with manual design in weeks, while simultaneously considering critical issues in package-board codesign. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in solving flip-chip pin-out placement problem in package-board codesign.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196134","","Costs;Design engineering;Electronics packaging;Geometry;Lead;Pins;Printed circuits;Process design;Signal design;Time to market","ball grid arrays;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit packaging","chipsets design;deep submicron effects;flip-chip BGA package;flip-chip pin-out designation respin;floorplanning;iterative interface design;package-board codesign;pin-block design","","5","","12","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Model-based function design and simulation are widely accepted and used by the Automotive EE community of today, to face some of the challenges. Emerging new standards - like AUTOSAR - bring standardized interfaces to low-level software, reducing cost and most importantly introducing a new level of abstraction to function implementers. Ease of software component reuse is another novel benefit brought by AUTOSAR. However, there is little guidance on how to translate the results of model-based function design into robust and efficient system implementations in a highly distributed environment. This paper outlines a proposed system level design methodology, supported by a set of point-tools, to bridge the Implementation Abyss. The flow covers: model transformation, architecture design, scheduling of networks and tasks distributed across multiple ECUs, harness design - followed by metrics and criteria-based evaluation of the resulting architecture.

TTL models are applied at all three abstraction levels of the design flow: functional, architecture and implementation level. The TTL model at the functional level serves as the functional reference.

It consists of complementary metal- oxide semiconductor (CMOS) reconfigurable logic and interconnect fabric, and carbon nanotube-based non-volatile on- chip configuration memory. Compared to existing CMOS- based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), NATURE increases logic density by more than an order of magnitude and offers cycle-by-cycle run-time reconfiguration capability. As opposed to some other recently proposed hybrid nano/CMOS designs, which mostly rely on the not-yet-mature self-assembly fabrication process, NATURE is compatible with mainstream photolithography fabrication techniques. Thus, NATURE offers a commercially feasible technology with high performance, superior integration density, and excellent run-time flexibility. In this paper, we present an integrated design and optimization platform for NATURE, called NanoMap. Given an input design specified in register-transfer level (RTL) and/or gate-level VHDL, NanoMap optimizes and implements the design on NATURE through logic mapping, temporal clustering, placement, and routing. NATURE offers a highly- efficient computation model, called temporal logic folding. A logic circuit can be arbitrarily folded into a sequence of logic stages, which temporally share and execute on the same hardware resource using fine-grain run-time reconfiguration. To effectively leverage this feature, we propose and develop novel mapping techniques which can automatically explore and identify the best temporal logic folding configuration, targeting area, delay or area-delay product. It uses a force- directed scheduling technique to optimize and balance resource usage across different folding cycles. It provides significant design flexibility in performing area-delay tradeoffs under various user-specified constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that NanoMap can judiciously trade off area and delay, and effectively exploit the different features - of NATURE.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261195","Algorithms;NATURE;NRAM;design;dynamic reconfiguration;logic folding;logic mapping","Delay effects;Design optimization;Fabrication;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic arrays;Logic circuits;Reconfigurable architectures;Reconfigurable logic;Runtime","CMOS logic circuits;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;logic design;semiconductor nanotubes","NATURE;NanoMap;carbon nanotube-based;complementary metal-oxide semiconductor reconfigurable logic;cycle-by-cycle run-time reconfiguration capability;field-programmable gate arrays;gate-level VHDL;hybrid nanotube-CMOS dynamically reconfigurable architecture;integrated design optimization flow;interconnect fabric;nonvolatile on-chip configuration memory;register-transfer level","","0","","20","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we introduce a heterogeneous multi-processor system using ASIPs as processing entities in a pipeline configuration. A streaming application is taken and manually broken into a series of algorithmic stages (each of which make up a stage in a pipeline). We formulate the problem of mapping each algorithmic stage in the system to an ASIP configuration, and propose a heuristic to efficiently search the design space for a pipeline-based multi ASIP system. We have implemented the proposed heterogeneous multiprocessor methodology using a commercial extensible processor (Xtensa LX from Tensilica Inc.). We have evaluated our system by creating two benchmarks (MP3 and JPEG encoders) which are mapped to our proposed design platform. Our multiprocessor design provided a performance improvement of at least 4.1 IX (JPEG) and 3.36X (MP3) compared to the single processor design.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to design rotary based circuit by proposing a unified clock and circuit design methodology. Given a sequential circuit and a clock frequency, our scheme derives a rotary clock network and a functionally equivalent circuit so that they can be integrated to operate reliably at the target frequency. We have applied our scheme to design several rotary clock based DSP modules. Simulation results show that all designs operate correctly with no timing violation.

We will show that control voltage (V<sub>cnt</sub>) of voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) in PLL can dynamically capture performance variations in circuit. By utilizing the V<sub>cnt</sub> signal of PLL, we propose variation resilient circuit design using adaptive body bias (VR-ABB). V<sub>cnt</sub> is used to generate an optimal body bias for various circuit blocks in order to avoid possible timing failures. Correspondingly, circuits can be designed with a significantly relaxed timing constraint compared to the conventional approaches, where a large amount of design resources can be wasted to take care of the worst case situations.

Estimation of software performance is essential in current software-dominated embedded systems. This work proposes an integrated methodology for system design and performance analysis. An analytic approach based on neural networks is used for high-level software performance estimation. At the functional level, this analytic tool enables a fast evaluation of the performance to be obtained with selected processors, which is an essential task for the definition of a ""golden"" architecture. From this architectural definition, a tool that refines hardware and software interfaces produces a bus-functional model. A virtual prototype is then generated from the bus-functional model, providing a global, cycle-accurate simulation model and offering several features for design validation and detailed performance analysis. Our work thus combines an analytic approach at functional level and a simulation-based approach at bus functional level. This provides an adequate trade-off between estimation time and precision. A multiprocessor platform implementing an MPEG4 encoder is used as case study, and the analytic estimation results in errors only up to 17% when compared to the virtual platform simulation. On the other hand, the analytic estimation takes only 17 seconds, against 10 minutes using the cycle-accurate simulation model.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195993","","Analytical models;Computer architecture;Embedded system;Hardware;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Refining;Software performance;Space exploration;System analysis and design","circuit CAD;coprocessors;formal verification;image coding;integrated software;multiprocessing systems;neural nets;software performance evaluation;system-on-chip","MPEG4 encoder;MPSoC design;bus-functional model;cycle-accurate simulation model;design space exploration;design validation;integrated methodology;multiprocessor platform;neural networks;performance analysis;software performance estimation;software-dominated embedded systems","","4","3","16","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our algorithm is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and guarantees to find an optimal solution for the addressed problem. It adopts a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, it first uses two reduction techniques to prune redundant solutions and create a global-routing path for each net. Without loss of the solution optimality, our reduction techniques can further prune the ILP variables (constraints) by 85.5% (98.0%) on average over a recent reduction technique. The detailed routing applies X-based grid- less routing to complete the routing. Experimental results based on five real industry designs show that our router can achieve 100% routability and the optimal global-routing wirelength and satisfy all signal-skew constraints, under reasonable CPU times, while recent related work results in much inferior solution quality.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261254","Algorithms;Design;Detailed Routing;Global Routing;Physical Design","Algorithm design and analysis;Central Processing Unit;Design engineering;Electronics packaging;Integer linear programming;Integrated circuit layout;Joining processes;Routing;Signal design;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit optimisation;flip-chip devices;integer programming;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging;linear programming;network routing","VLSI design;flip-chip design;integer linear programming;reduction technique;routing algorithm","","9","","7","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we focus on abstraction of computation and describe our abstract modeling of embedded processors. We combine the computation modeling with task scheduling support and accurate interrupt handling into a versatile, multi-faceted processor model with varying levels of features. Incorporating the abstract processor model into a communication model, we achieve fast co-simulation of a complete custom target architecture for a system level design exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an industrial strength telecommunication example executing on a Motorola DSP architecture. Our results indicate the tremendous value of abstract processor modeling.

While optimizing tabular data, significant fitting efforts are required to fit the data into convex form. Fitting the tables into analytically convex forms like posynomials, suffers from excessive fitting errors, as the fitting problem may be non-convex. In recent literature optimal numerically convex tables have been proposed. Since these tables are numerical, it is extremely important to make the table data smooth, and yet preserve its convexity. The smoothness ensures that the convex optimizer behaves predictably and converges quickly to the global optimal point. The existing smoothing techniques either cannot preserve convexity, or require very high execution time. In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm to smoothen a given numerically convex data and at the same time preserve convexity. Our proposed algorithm SmartSmooth can smoothen the data in linear time without introducing any additional error on the numerically convex data. We present our SmartSmooth results on industrial cell libraries. SmartSmooth when applied on convex tables produced by ConvexFit shows a 30times reduction in fitting square error over a posynomial fitting algorithm.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196091","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Design optimization;Fitting;Libraries;Numerical models;Shape;Smoothing methods;Table lookup;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit optimisation;convex programming;integrated circuit design;polynomials","ConvexFit;SmartSmooth;VLSI design;convex optimization;convex tables;fitting square error;global optimal point;linear time algorithm;linear time convexity;numerically convex data;posynomial fitting algorithm;smoothing algorithm","","1","","16","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Systems built from those will most probably impact our lives and society in a profound way. Outcomes will influence the ways we build mechanical structures, do computing, make drugs, generate energy and take care of our environment. Yet, while the basic components are dramatically different from our silicon devices, the basic strategy for building very complex systems from them remains unchanged. The art of design, as was developed in the silicon era, is just as applicable to these nano- or bio-constructions. Design methodology is a legacy that will live long after Moore's law has come to a halt.

For those designs, a strategy of optimizing a circuit for the worst-case conditions could lead to inefficient resource use. It is possible to improve the throughput of such circuits by introducing variable latency. One of the existing realizations of variable-latency design style is based on telescopic units. The design of the hold logic in telescopic units influences the circuit's throughput. In this paper, we show that the traditionally-designed hold logic in telescopic units may be inaccurate. We make use of the short path activation conditions to obtain more accurate hold logic than that commonly applied in the telescopic units. On average, our approach achieves a performance gain of 25.79% compared to 14.04%, which was reported in the previous works.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261326","Design;Logic synthesis;Performance;throughput optimization;timing analysis","Adders;Clocks;Delay;Logic circuits;Logic design;Optical design;Optimization;Permission;Throughput;Timing","logic design","hold logic design;performance optimization;telescopic units;variable-latency designs","","1","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first present a case study of a SOC design and show detailed IR-drop analysis, measurement and its effects on design performance during at-speed test. We then propose a novel method to measure the average power of at-speed test patterns, referred to as switching cycle average power (SCAP).

However, measured performance based on fabricated circuits is much worse than simulated performance based on the layout. It is suspected that the via resistance variation is the cause. In this paper, our extensive simulation confirm this. A new redundant via insertion technique is proposed to reduce via variation and signal distortion. In addition, a new buffer insertion technique is proposed to synchronize the transmitted signals, thus further improving the effectiveness of the twisted differential line. Experimental results demonstrate that the new approaches are highly effective. Under a realistic setup, a 6 GHz signal can be transmitted with high fidelity using the new approaches. In contrast, only a 100 MHz signal can be reliably transmitted using a single-end model with power/ground shielding. In addition, compared to conventional twisted differential line structure, our new techniques can reduce the magnitude of noise by 45%. Furthermore, compared to unbuffered twisted differential line structure, the maximum signal phase difference is reduced from 37ps to 7ps by the new buffer insertion technique.

In spite of this shift, the problem of discrete gate sizing has received significantly less attention than its continuous counterpart. On the other hand, cell sizes of many realistic libraries are sparse, for example, geometrically spaced, which makes the nearest rounding approach inapplicable as large timing violations may be introduced. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design an effective algorithm to handle this discrete gate sizing problem. Such an algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is a continuous solution guided dynamic programming approach. A set of novel techniques, such as locality sensitive hashing based solution selection and stage pruning, are also proposed to accelerate the algorithm and improve the solution quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) nearest rounding approach often leads to large timing violations and (2) compared to the well-known Coudert's approach, the new algorithm saves 9% - 31% in area cost while still satisfying the timing constraint.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261301","Algorithms;Design;Dynamic Programming;Gate Sizing;Performance","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Design automation;Design methodology;Dynamic programming;Libraries;Permission;Time to market;Timing","cryptography;digital libraries;dynamic programming;time to market","cell library-based designs;discrete gate sizing;dynamic programming gate approach;gate sizing;library-based methodologies;locality sensitive hashing based solution selection;rounding approach;stage pruning;time-to-market pressure","","9","","8","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PEVT is responsible to generate the verification cases, consisting of both the hardware and software modules, which are then used to trigger the expected behaviors. A monitor is also generated from the EXPDL description to verify these cases. PEVT has been applied to the verification of an academic implementation of ARM7 microprocessor core, which has had a SoC test chip and software porting including MP3 decoder and uC-OSII. PEVT successfully identified several sophisticated remaining bugs with only less than 88,000 cycles of RTL simulation with execution time of 424 seconds in a SUN Blade2000 workstation. The experiment shows that PEVT could generate highly focused verification cases, less than 21 cycles per case on the average, which identify potential bugs with much less simulation cycles, compared with traditional regression tests which consume huge amount of simulation cycles.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261310","ADL;Design;Languages;Microprocessor external interrupt verification;Verification;simulation-based","Architecture description languages;Computer bugs;Decoding;Design automation;Digital audio players;Hardware;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Software testing;Sun","interrupts;logic CAD;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;program verification;system-on-chip","ARM7 microprocessor core;CAD tool;EXPDL;MP3 decoder;PEVT;RTL simulation;SUN Blade2000 workstation;SoC test chip;architecture description language extension;microprocessor design;microprocessors external interrupt behaviors;regression tests;software porting;uC-OSII","","0","","18","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was shown in previous works that operating at the V<sub>min</sub> supply voltage results in optimal energy operation, where V<sub>min</sub> typically falls below the threshold voltage. However, all previous subthreshold analyses ignore the leakage current in standby mode. Hence, for applications where operation at V<sub>min</sub> results in completion of the task well ahead of the required deadline, the energy consumption can be significantly under-estimated In this paper, we investigate the effect of the non-zero standby energy on the optimal energy consumption in subthreshold operation. We first analyze energy consumption both with and without a cutoff technique in standby mode. Two parameters are proposed to capture the cutoff structure's effect on the energy consumption. Second, a methodology to minimize the total energy consumption is addressed The selection of the cutoff structure is examined by comparing three different structures. Then, a co-optimization method to optimize the size of the cutoff structure concurrently with the supply voltage, is proposed.

The refinement of communication between these different IP's, known as hardware/software interfaces, is widely seen as the design bottleneck due to their complexity. In order to perform early design validation and architecture exploration, flexible executable models of these interfaces are needed at different abstraction levels. In this paper, we define a unified methodology to implement executable models of the hardware/software interface based on SystemC.

Existing approaches can not handle large numbers of I/O counts and large numbers of legal decap positions. In this paper, we propose a fast decoupling capacitor allocation method. By applying a spectral clustering, a small amount of principal I/Os can be found. Accordingly, the large power supply network is partitioned into several blocks each with only one principal I/O. This enables a localized macromodeling for each block by a triangular-structured reduction. In addition, to systemically consider a large legal position map in a manageable fashion, the map of legal positions is decomposed into multiple rings, which are further parameterized in each block. The decaps are then allocated according to the sensitivity obtained from the parameterized macro- model for each block. Compared to the PRIMA-based macromodeling, experiments show that our method (TBS2) is 25X faster and has 3.04X smaller error. Moreover, our decap allocation reduces the optimization time by 97X, and reduces decap cost by up to 16% to meet the same power-integrty target.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261256","Algorithms;Model Order Reduction;PG grid simulation;design","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitors;Costs;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit packaging;Law;Legal factors;Noise level;Power supplies;Resonance","capacitors;integrated circuit packaging","chip package co-design;chip-package interface;localized macromodeling;off-chip decoupling capacitor allocation;spectral clustering;triangular-structured reduction","","1","","8","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, co- design of hybrid NEMS-CMOS as low power dynamic OR gates, SRAM cells, and sleep transistors is explored. Simulation results indicate that such hybrid dynamic OR gates can achieve 60-80% lower switching power and almost zero leakage power consumption with minor delay penalty. However, the hybrid gate outperforms its CMOS counterpart both in terms of delay and switching power consumption with increase in fan-in beyond 12. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed hybrid SRAM cell can achieve almost 8times lower standby leakage power consumption with only minor noise margin and latency cost.

In this work, we present a model-driven methodology for generating directed tests that take the SystemC model under validation to specific reachable states. This allows the validation to uncover very specific scenarios which lead to different corner cases. Our formal modeling is done entirely within the Microsoft SpecExplorer tool to describe the specification of the system under validation in the notation of AsmL.

The proposed method does not require any specific clock tree construction, special scan cells, or scan chain reordering. Test cubes generated by any combinational ATPG can be processed by the proposed method to reduce peak and average switching activity without any capture violation. Switching activity during scan shift cycles is reduced by assigning identical values to adjacent scan inputs and switching activity during capture cycles is reduced by limiting the number of scan chains that capture responses. Hardware overhead for the proposed method is negligible. The peak transition is reduced by about 40% and average number of transitions is reduced by about 56-85%.

In particular, energy consumption and distributing a single global clock signal throughout a chip have become major design bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, a globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) design is considered for achieving low power consumption and modular design. Such a design style fits nicely with the concept of voltage-frequency islands (VFIs) which has been recently introduced for achieving fine-grain system-level power management. This paper proposes a design methodology for partitioning an NoC architecture into multiple VFIs and assigning supply and threshold voltage levels to each VFI Simulation results show about 40% savings for a real video application and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the overall system energy consumption.

"Improving Voltage Assignment by Outlier Detection and Incremental Placement","Huaizhi Wu; Wong, M.D.F.","Atoptech Inc., San Diego","Design Automation Conference, 2007. DAC '07. 44th ACM/IEEE","20070625","2007","","","459","464","Design for low power has become a key requirement in today's SoC design, especially for mobile applications. Multi-Vdd is an effective method to reduce both leakage and dynamic power. In a multi-Vdd design, cells of different supply voltages are often grouped into a small number of voltage islands, in order to avoid complex power supply system and excessive amount of level shifters. Recently, Wu et al. (2005) proposed an elegant algorithm for voltage island grouping based on the physical proximity of the critical cells in a post- placement voltage assignment, and Wu et al. (2006) proposed an efficient algorithm for voltage assignment which not only meets timing but also forms good proximity of the critical cells. However, due to insufficient slack, a few isolated critical cells (called outliers) may still exist in the resulting voltage assignment, causing disproportionately expensive penalty to the final voltage island grouping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the voltage assignment by automatic outlier detection followed by incremental placement. The outlier detection is based on a modified algorithm for the facility location problem. The incremental placement is guided by setting proper constraints on the paths containing the detected outliers, such that the outliers can be eliminated later. Our experiments on industry designs show that our algorithm leads to 12% - 54% improvement in the final voltage island grouping, with quick turn around time.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261228","Algorithms;Design;Low power;Outlier;Placement;Voltage assignment","Algorithm design and analysis;Contracts;Costs;Delay;Design optimization;Low voltage;Power supplies;Routing;Timing","logic design;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","SoC design;facility location;incremental placement;low power design;mobile application;multiVdd design;outlier detection;supply voltage;voltage assignment;voltage island grouping","","2","","10","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ultra- low-power designs may even permit embedded systems to operate without batteries, e.g., by scavenging energy from the environment. Moreover, managing power dissipation is now a key factor in integrated circuit packaging and cooling. As a result, embedded system price, size, weight, and reliability are all strongly dependent on power dissipation. Recent developments in nanoscale devices open new alternatives for low-power embedded system design. Among these, single-electron tunneling transistors (SETs) hold the promise of achieving the lowest power consumption. However, SETs impose unique design constraints that strongly influence architectural and circuit-level decisions. Unfortunately, most analysis of SETs has focused on single devices instead of architectures, making it difficult to determine whether they are appropriate for low-power embedded systems. This article presents possible uses of SETs in high-performance and battery-powered embedded system design. The resulting fault-tolerant, hybrid SET/CMOS, reconfigurable architecture can be tailored to specific requirements and allows trade-offs among power consumption, performance, operation temperature, fabrication cost, and reliability. This work is a first step in evaluating the system-level potential of reducing power consumption by using SETs.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261197","Design;Single electron tunneling transistor (SET);low-power;nanoelectronics;performance;reconfigurable architecture;reliability","Batteries;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy management;Integrated circuit packaging;Power dissipation;Power system management;Power system reliability;Single electron transistors;Tunneling","CMOS integrated circuits;embedded systems;fault tolerance;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;nanoelectronics;semiconductor device models;single electron transistors","battery-powered embedded system design;embedded system design;hybrid SET/CMOS;integrated circuit packaging;power dissipation;reconfigurable architecture;single-electron tunneling transistor;ultra-low-power architecture","","2","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key design insights that we obtain are: (1) degradation due to NBTI is most sensitive on the input patterns and the duty cycle; the difference in the delay degradation can be up to 5X for various static and dynamic conditions, (2) during dynamic operation, NBTI-induced degradation is relatively insensitive to supply voltage, but strongly dependent on temperature; (3) NBTI has marginal impact on the clock signal.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261207","Design;Experimentation;NBTI;Performance;Reliability;duty cycle;input pattern;performance degradation;speed;supply voltage;temperature","Circuit optimization;Degradation;Niobium compounds;Performance analysis;Sequential circuits;Signal analysis;Switching circuits;Temperature;Titanium compounds;Voltage","combinational circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;network topology;sequential circuits","circuit performance degradation;circuit topology;combinational circuit;negative-bias-temperature-instability;sequential circuit","","19","4","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applying a corollary of Moore's Law for multicore, we expect to see 1K multicore chips within a decade. 1K multicore systems introduce significant architectural challenges. One of these is the power efficiency challenge. Today's cores consume 10's of watts. Even at about one watt per core, a 1K-core chip would need to dissipate 1K watts! This paper discusses the ""Kill rule for multicore"" for power-efficient multicore design, an approach inspired by the ""Kiss rule for RISC processor design"". Kill stands for Kill if less than linear, and represents a design approach in which any additional area allocated to a resource within a core, such as a cache, is carefully traded off against using the area for additional cores. The Kill rule states that we must increase resource size (for example, cache size) only if for every 1% increase in core area there is at least a 1% increase in core performance.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261283","CMP;Design;Economics;Experimentation;Kill Rule;Measurement;Performance;Theory;computer architecture;core;multicore;parallel computing;power efficiency;stream processing;tiled multicore","Computer applications;Computer architecture;Engines;Moore's Law;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Permission;Process design;Reduced instruction set computing;Resource management","microprocessor chips","KILL rule;multicore chips;power-efficient multicore design","","0","2","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we demonstrate that conventional power management schemes, which are designed without considering the impact of variations, can result in substantial power wastage. We therefore propose two approaches to variation-aware power management, namely, design-specific and chip-specific approaches. In each of these approaches, the goal is to consider the impact of variations while deriving the values of parameters that govern popular power management policies. The policy parameters are derived so as to optimize metrics that are relevant under variations. We motivate and introduce these metrics, and use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to optimize them. We experimentally evaluate the proposed ideas in the context of an ARM processor core, and demonstrate that variation-aware power management can result in improvements of upto 59 % in mu + sigma of the energy distribution, and upto 55 % for the 95 percentile of the energy distribution, with respect to conventional power management schemes that do not consider variations.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261306","Algorithms;Design;Low Power Design;Management;Power Management;Process variations;System-on-Chip","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Design optimization;Energy management;Laboratories;National electric code;Power distribution;Power system management;System-on-a-chip;Very large scale integration","integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","ARM processor core;energy distribution;leakage power variations;nanoscale technologies;process variations;system-on-chip power management;variation-aware power management","","0","","22","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on post-synthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time-consuming, but it also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Moreover, post-synthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; non-routable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a droplet-routing-aware automated synthesis tool for microfluidic biochips. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis flow. The proposed approach allows architectural-level design choices and droplet-routing-aware physical design decisions to be made simultaneously.

Amongst others, this free LUT-internal resource perturbation can also be used to trade for critical LUT-external logic/wire removals for EDA improvements, an extra flexibility ignored before. Using rewiring technique for such logic perturbations, we show that significant cut-downs upon already excellent results from the state-of-the-art DAOmap mappings and the TVPR place-and-route can still be obtained. This logic perturbation operation can further reduce the number of LUTs by up to 33.7% (avg. 10%) without delay penalty and also reduce critical path delay by up to 31.7% (avg. 11%) without disturbing placement or sacrificing area in the final routing. For delay reduction, under proper rewiring strategy, the CPU time used by rewiring is only 5% of the total run time consumed by TVPR's placement and routing. This idea of perturbing logic between the free LUT-internal and critical LUT-external circuit resources is simple and proved to be powerful.

Due to the high complexity of DR algorithms, it is very important to start the routing process with clean solutions, rather than starting with suboptimal routes and trying to fix them in iterative process. In this paper, we propose an escape routing algorithm that can optimize routing of a set of nets around their terminals. For this, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees to find the optimal escape routing solution for a set of nets when the track structures are uniform. Then, we use this algorithm as a baseline, and study the general problem with arbitrary track structures. For this, we propose a novel multi-commodity flow (MCF) model that has a one-to-one correspondence with the escape routing problem. This MCF model is novel in the sense that the inter-dependency and contention between different flow commodities is minimal. Using this model, we propose a Lagrangian-relaxation (LR) based algorithm to solve the escape problem. Our experiments demonstrate that this algorithm improves the overall routability significantly by reducing the number of nets that require rip-up and reroute.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261142","Algorithms;Design;Detailed routing;escape routing;multi-commodity flow","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Design for manufacture;Hardware;Iterative algorithms;Lagrangian functions;Polynomials;Routing;Wire","computational complexity;integrated circuit design;network routing","Lagrangian-relaxation algorithm;circuit densities;dense pin clusters;detailed routing;escape routing;integrated circuit;multicommodity flow;polynomial-time algorithm","","0","1","16","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, placement solution considered to be good by primitive interconnect models may turn out to be poor after routing. In addition, the placement may not even be routable and timing closure may not be achievable. In this paper, we propose to address the inconsistency between the placement and routing objectives by fully integrating global routing into placement. As a first attempt to this novel approach, we focus on routability issue. We call the proposed algorithm for routing congestion minimization IPR (integrated placement and routing). To ensure the algorithm to be computationally efficient, efficient placement and routing algorithms FastPlace, FastDP and FastRoute are integrated, and well-designed methods are proposed to integrate them efficiently and effectively.

This work is the first to parameterize shared resource accesses in the form of access attributes, summarizing the impact of shared resource contention on system performance, analogous to the way RTL parameters summarize more detailed transistor models. The intuition behind access attributes is that much application and architecture dependent contention information is known during detailed cycle-accurate simulations, and would be useful to inform a higher level model. The detailed contention information is sampled from a short cycle-accurate simulation, ""training"" a high-level statistical regression model of contention. This contention model can then be used in simulation to estimate the impact of shared resource accesses at a high level of abstraction, enabling the designers to explore contention-related performance impacts of design decisions.

An important design constraint in such architectures is that the FIFO buffers connecting the processing elements (in a pipelined fashion) should not overflow and the playout buffer should never underflow. To meet these constraints, an usual design practice is to increase the initial playout delay after which the output device starts reading from the playout buffer. Although implementing this technique is straightforward and involves only the the computation of an appropriate playout delay, it suffers from the downside of a large playout buffer being required. In this paper, instead of associating the playout delay solely with the output device, we propose to redistribute this delay among all the processing elements running the various tasks of the multimedia application. We show that this delay redistribution technique can signficantly reduce (up to 70%) the total on-chip memory required.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261280","Design;On-chip memory;Performance;Playout delay;System-level design;Video decoding","Application software;Buffer overflow;Clocks;Computer science;Delay;Joining processes;Multimedia systems;Pipelines;System-on-a-chip;Virtual colonoscopy","multimedia systems;storage management;system-on-chip","data memory footprint;multimedia application;multiple processing element;on-chip memory;playout buffer;playout delay redistribution;system-on-chip architecture","","1","","10","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minimization of leakage power unavoidably enforces the consideration of the key sources of process variations, namely transistor channel length and threshold variations, since both have a significant impact on timing and leakage power. However, the statistical nature of chip performances often requires the use of expensive statistical analysis and optimization techniques in a leakage minimization task, contributing to high computational complexity. Further, the commonly used discrete cell libraries bring specific difficulty for design optimization and render pure continuous sizing and V<sub>T</sub> optimization algorithm suboptimal. In this paper, we present a fast yet effective approach to statistical leakage power reduction via gate sizing and multiple V<sub>T</sub> assignment. The proposed technique achieves the runtime efficiency via the use of the novel concept of equi-slack shells and performs fast leakage power reduction on the basis of shells while maintaining the timing yield.

In comparison with the discrete-register based architecture, DRFM offers a higher degree of opportunity of reducing the cost of global (inter- island) connections by confining as many the computations to the inside of the islands as possible. Consequently, for DRFM architecture, two important problems to be solved effectively in high-level synthesis are: (problem 1) scheduling and resource binding for minimizing inter-island connections, and (problem 2) data transfer (i.e., communication) scheduling through the inter-island connections for minimizing the access conflicts among the data transfers. This work proposes novel solutions to the two problems. Specifically, for problem 1 previous work solves it in two separate steps: (i) scheduling and (ii) then determining the inter-island connections by resource binding to islands. However, in our algorithm called DFRM-int, we place primary importance on the cost of interconnections. Consequently, we minimize the cost of interconnections first to fully exploit the effects of scheduling on interconnect and then to schedule the operations later. For problem 2, previous work tries to solve the access conflicts by forwarding data directly to the destination island. However, in our algorithm called DFRM-com, we devise an efficient technique of exploring an extensive design space of data forwarding indirectly as well as directly to find a near-optimal solution. By applying our proposed synthesis approach DFRM-int+DFRM-com we are able to reduce the inter-island connections by 18.1% more, compared to that by the DRFM approach in [4], even completely eliminating register-file access conflicts, which c- ould never been resolved by [4], without any latency increase.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261286","Algorithms;Design;Synthesis;communication;distributed register file","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Costs;Delay;High level synthesis;Logic design;Microarchitecture;Processor scheduling;Registers;Routing","distributed databases;network operating systems","data transfer;distributed register-file microarchitecture;interconnect-communication synthesis;multiple uniform blocks","","0","","18","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A gate-voltage dependent model of Le is developed which is scalable with design conditions, continuous across weak and strong inversion regions, accurate for both leakage and saturation current, and compatible with standard circuit analysis tools. We systematically verify this approach with 65 nm TCAD simulations. A generic CAD algorithm is further proposed to predict the value of Le under various non-rectangular geometries. The interaction with the narrow-width effect is efficiently convolved in this method. Depending on the gate geometry, the leakage current can vary more than 15X at 65 nm technology node. Our analytical method well captures this effect. Finally, we extrapolate the impact of NRG effect on future technology generations. The proposed model can be easily extracted from TCAD tools or direct silicon data.

Unlike the previous works that can handle only ID symmetry constraints, our ASF-B*-tree is the first in the literature to additionally consider 2D symmetry. We then present hierarchical B*-trees (HB*-trees) which can simultaneously optimize the placement with both symmetry islands and non-symmetry modules. Unlike the previous works, our approach can guarantee the close proximity of symmetry modules and significantly reduce the search space based on the symmetry-island formulation. In particular, the packing time for an ASF-B*- tree or an HB*-tree is the same as that for a plain B*-tree (only amortized linear) and much faster than previous works which need at least loglinear time.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for a-Si:H TFT circuits' reliability simulation. We show that: (1) the threshold voltage (V<sub>TH</sub>) shift of a single TFT can be modeled by analyzing its operating conditions and (2) the circuit lifetime can be predicted accordingly using SPICE. We also propose an algorithm to reduce the simulation time by orders of magnitude with negligible accuracy loss. To validate our analytical model and simulation methodology, we compare the SPICE simulation results with the actual measurements of our integrated a-Si:H TFT scan driver fabricated on the glass substrate and demonstrate very high consistency in the overall results.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261324","Amorphous Hydrogenated Silicon (a-Si:H);Design;Experimentation;Flexible Electronics;Reliability;Scan Driver;Thin-Film Transistor;Threshold Voltage","Analytical models;Circuit simulation;Consumer electronics;Driver circuits;Flexible electronics;Plastic films;SPICE;Substrates;Thin film circuits;Thin film transistors","circuit reliability;flexible electronics;thin film transistors","SPICE simulation;TFT circuit reliability simulation;TFT scan driver;flexible circuit design;flexible electronics;thin-film transistors","","0","","7","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The state migration in the matching procedure incurs intensive memory accesses. Thus, it is critical to minimize the storage of state machines such that they can be fit in on-chip or other fast memory modules to achieve high-speed pattern matching. This paper proposes novel optimization techniques, namely state re-labeling and memory partition, to reduce state machine storage.

The power traces of 8000 encryptions are for instance sufficient to extract the secret key of an unprotected ASIC AES implementation, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the 2128 tests required to brute force the algorithm.

Current system-level power analysis tools are incapable of generating power estimates under real-life workloads within an acceptable amount of time, even for moderately complex SoCs. Our work addresses this problem by borrowing on emulation, which is a widely used technique to accelerate functional verification. Unfortunately, hardware emulation of all the necessary functions for full SoC power analysis is likely to be infeasible for most systems, due to constraints on emulation capacity, and the lack of emulation-ready, synthesizable models for some SoC components early in the design process. This paper describes hybrid power estimation, an approach to accelerating SoC power analysis by emulating the functional and power models of a subset of SoC components on an FPGA platform (even a low-cost, off-the-shelf FGPA board). We describe the hardware and software components of the framework, and propose techniques to overcome the challenges posed by limited host-board communication bandwidth. We have implemented a hybrid power estimation framework using a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro emulation platform and software extensions to an HDL simulator, to conduct power analysis of a video decoder SoC. The results indicate 65-332X gains in analysis efficiency over simulation-based power estimation, with no loss in accuracy. Further, we show that the increase in FPGA resource requirements for hybrid power estimation over pure functional emulation are modest.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261307","Design;Emulation;Experimentation;Performance;Power Estimation;Power analysis;Simulation;System-on-chip","Acceleration;Analytical models;Bandwidth;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Power generation;Power system modeling;Process design;System-on-a-chip","electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;system-on-chip","FPGA platform;HDL simulator;SoC;Xilinx Virtex-II Pro emulation platform;functional verification;hardware emulation;hybrid power estimation;limited host-board communication bandwidth;system-level power analysis tools;system-on-chip power analysis","","0","","15","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our multi-processor system, we apply back-pressure, which means that tasks wait for space in output buffers. Consequently buffer capacities affect the throughput. This requires the derivation of buffer capacities that both result in a satisfaction of the throughput constraint, and also satisfy the constraints on the maximum buffer capacities. Existing exact solutions suffer from the computational complexity that is associated with the required conversion from a cyclo-static dataflow graph to a single-rate dataflow graph. In this paper we present an algorithm, with polynomial computational complexity, that does not require this conversion and that obtains close to minimal buffer capacities. The algorithm is applied to an MP3 play-back application that is mapped on our multi-processor system. For this application, we see that a cyclo-static dataflow model can reduce the buffer capacities by 50% compared to a multi-rate dataflow model.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261266","Algorithms;Buffer Capacity;Dataflow;Design;Performance;System-on-Chip","Computational complexity;Containers;Delay;Permission;Polynomials;Real time systems;Runtime;Streaming media;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","buffer storage;computational complexity;microprocessor chips;real-time systems","buffer capacities;cyclostatic dataflow graphs;cyclostatic realtime systems;multiprocessor system;polynomial computational complexity","","4","","12","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an embedded multi-resolution AMBA trace analyzer that provides the trade-off between the trace granularity and the trace depth. It consists of two major trace approaches: (1) the signal monitor/tracing which provides the levels of abstraction, and (2) the trace reduction. In the first approach, it allows designers to zoom-in/out to preferred level of abstraction to serve different debugging purposes. In the second approach, the trace analyzer compresses the traced data according to signal characteristics and the cost of on-chip storage is reduced. The trace data will be decompressed on the host for further observation and debugging. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can reach a good compression ratio of 96% and the trace depth is more than two thousand cycles at the higher abstraction level.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261231","AMBA;Design;Verification;compression;multi-resolution;tracing","Computer science;Costs;Debugging;Hardware;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Permission;Signal analysis;Signal design;System-on-a-chip","microprocessor chips;system-on-chip","bus tracing;debugging purposes;embedded multiresolution AMBA trace analyzer;microprocessor-based SoC integration;on-chip storage;signal characteristics;signal monitor-tracing;trace granularity;trace reduction","","0","1","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some biological systems exploit such randomness, choosing between different outcomes stochastically - in effect, hedging their bets with a portfolio of responses for different environmental conditions. In this paper, we discuss techniques for synthesizing such stochastic behavior in engineered biochemical systems. We propose a general method for designing a set of biochemical reactions that produces different combinations of molecular types according to a specified probability distribution. The response is precise and robust to perturbations. Furthermore, it is programmable: the probability distribution is a function of the quantities of input types. The method is modular and extensible. We discuss strategies for implementing various functional dependencies: linear, logarithmic, exponential, etc. This work has potential applications in domains such as biochemical sensing, drug production, and disease treatment.

As the probability of failure (POF) computed from critical area analysis and defect size distribution strongly depends on wire ordering, sizing, and spacing, track routing plays a key role in effective wire planning for yield optimization. TROY formulates wire ordering into a preference-aware minimum Hamiltonian path problem. For simultaneous wire sizing and spacing optimization, TROY solves it optimally by formulating the problems into a second order conic programming (SOCP). Experimental results show that TROY can reduce the random-defect yield loss by 18% on average without any overhead in wirelength, compared with the widely used greedy approach.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261143","Algorithms;Design;Manufacturability;Performance;Track Routing;VLSI;Yield","Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed computing;Failure analysis;Hardware;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit manufacture;Integrated circuit yield;Routing;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit yield;network routing","critical area analysis;defect size distribution;failure probability;random defects;second order conic programming;track router;wire ordering;wire sizing;wire spacing;yield optimization;yield-driven wire planning","","1","","26","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, current approaches target the combinational circuits even though sequential elements, such as flip-flops, contribute an appreciable proportion of the total leakage. A skewed flip-flop (SFF) is obtained by slightly increasing the gate length of a subset of the transistors in a conventional flip-flop. The resulting SFF will exhibit very skewed characteristics in terms of leakage and delay, which depend on the transistors that are replaced. We present an algorithm that selectively substitutes SFFs for conventional flip-flops in sequential circuits, such that the timing constraint is still satisfied while the leakage from the flip-flops is reduced.

Real-time processing at this data rate is beyond the scope of today's standard and DSP processors, and ASICs are not economically viable due to the small market volume. As an answer to these challenges, an FPGA-based approach was followed in the FlexFilm project. The multi-board, multi-FPGA hardware/software architecture is based on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs which contain the reconfigurable image stream processing data path, large external SDRAM memories for multiple frame storage, and a PCI Express communication backbone network. Different applications are supported on a single hardware platform by using different FPGA configurations.

In this paper we introduce a novel and efficient hardware-supported approach. Our scheme reduces the size of the generated decoding table by splitting instructions into portions of varying size (called patterns) before Huffman coding compression is applied. It improves the final compression ratio (including all overhead that incurs) by more than 20% compared to known schemes based on Huffman coding. We achieve allover compression ratios as low as 44%. Thereby, our scheme is orthogonal to approaches that take particularities of a certain instruction set architectures into account.

As a result, there has been a lot of recent interest in timing and predictability analysis techniques that are specifically targeted towards FlexRay. In this paper we propose a compositional performance analysis framework for a network of electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate via a FlexRay bus. Given a specification of the tasks running on the different ECUs, the scheduling policy used at each ECU, and a specification of the FlexRay bus (e.g. slot sizes and message priorities), our framework can answer questions related to the maximum end-to-end delay experienced by any message, the amount of buffer required at each communication controller and the utilization of the different ECUs and the bus. In contrast to previous timing analysis techniques which analyze the FlexRay bus in isolation, our framework is fully compositional and allows the modeling of the schedulers at the ECUs and the FlexRay protocol in a seamless manner. As a result, it can be used to analyze large systems and does not involve any computationally expensive step like solving an ILP (which previous approaches require). We illustrate our framework using detailed examples and also present results from a Matlab-based implementation.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261192","Automotive electronics;Bus protocols;Design;FlexRay;Performance","Automotive engineering;Communication system control;Computer languages;Delay;Mathematical model;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Size control;Timing","automotive electronics;protocols","communication controller;compositional performance analysis framework;end-to-end delay;flexray-based electronic control units;invehicle automotive communication systems;performance analysis;predictability analysis techniques;predominant protocol","","10","","18","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an implicitly parallel programming model, programmers maximize algorithm- level parallelism, express their parallel algorithms by asserting high-level properties on top of a traditional sequential programming language, and rely on parallelizing compilers and hardware support to perform parallel execution under the hood. In such a model, compilers and related tools require much more advanced program analysis capabilities and programmer assertions than what are currently available so that a comprehensive understanding of the input program's concurrency can be derived. Such an understanding is then used to drive automatic or interactive parallel code generation tools for a diverse set of parallel hardware organizations. The chip-level architecture and hardware should maintain parallel execution state in such a way that a strictly sequential execution state can always be derived for the purpose of verifying and debugging the program. We argue that implicitly parallel programming models are critical for addressing the software development crises and software scalability challenges for many-core microprocessors.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261284","Design;Human Factors;Languages;Parallel Programming","Computer architecture;Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Debugging;Hardware;Microprocessors;Parallel algorithms;Parallel programming;Program processors;Programming profession","concurrency control;microprocessor chips;parallel algorithms;parallel programming;parallelising compilers;program debugging;program diagnostics;program verification","chip-level architecture;many-core microprocessors;parallel algorithms;parallel code generation;parallel execution;parallel programming;parallelizing compilers;program analysis;program concurrency;program debugging;program verification;programmer assertion;sequential programming language;software development;software scalability;thousand-core microprocessors","","1","","24","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In most of the arithmetic circuits the outcome of the synthesis tools depends on the input description of the circuit. In other words, logic synthesis optimisations hardly change the architecture of the given circuit. However, once the input description belongs to the right architecture, logic synthesis does an excellent job in optimising the circuit locally. This is the reason why designers still rely on well studied architectures. The main difficulty in finding the suitable architecture for an arithmetic circuit is the high fan-in dependencies between inputs and outputs (i.e., each output bit depends on a large portion of input bits). Hence, imposing hierarchy and structure is the key to find the best architecture. Although factorisation is one potential solution for this problem, the computational complexity of Boolean factorisation and poor performance of algebraic factorisation make this solution impractical in most cases of interest. In this paper we present a novel approach which progressively decomposes the input circuits into building blocks and constructs hierarchy among these blocks. We show that our approach optimises the critical path delay by 15-30% at the cost of marginal or no area penalty. In some cases, it even improves the area. Qualitatively we observed that our approach found the best known architecture for some circuits without any a priori knowledge about the functionality of the circuit.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261216","Algorithms;Boolean Ring;Design;Factorisation;Performance;Progressive Decomposition","Circuit synthesis;Computational complexity;Computer architecture;Cost function;Delay;Detectors;Digital arithmetic;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Manuals","Boolean algebra","Boolean ring;algebraic factorisation;progressive decomposition;structure arithmetic circuits","","0","","13","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the urban challenge competition will be focused on, in which fully- autonomous passenger vehicles will conduct navigation missions in urban environments. The goal of the urban challenge is to develop vehicles that can safely drive themselves in realistic urban settings. To succeed, the vehicles must obey traffic laws while safely merging into moving traffic, driving through traffic circles and busy intersections, and parking in parking lots. This represents a significant leap in autonomous vehicle technology and has required advances in sensing, autonomous reasoning, and semiconductor technology.

Countermeasures proposed to overcome Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA), are data masking, table masking, current flattening, circuitry level solutions, dummy instruction insertions and balancing bit-flips. All these techniques are either susceptible to multi-order side channel attacks, not sufficiently generic to cover all encryption algorithms, or burden the system with high area cost, run-time or energy consumption. A HW/SW based randomized instruction injection technique is proposed in this paper to overcome the pitfalls of previous countermeasures. Our technique injects random instructions at random places during the execution of an application which protects the system from both SPA and DPA. Further, we devise a systematic method to measure the security level of a power sequence and use it to measure the number of random instructions needed, to suitably confuse the adversary.

Programming errors in one application can easily corrupt the state of the operating system and other applications on the microcontroller. In this paper we propose a system that provides memory protection in tiny embedded processors. . Our system consists of a software run-time working with minimal low-cost architectural extensions to the processor core that prevents corruption of state by buggy applications. We restrict memory accesses and control flow of applications to protection domains within the address space. The software run-time consists of a Memory map: a flexible and efficient data structure that records ownership and layout information of the entire address space. Memory map checks are done for store instructions by hardware accelerators that significantly improve the performance of our system. We preserve control flow integrity by maintaining a Safe stack that stores return addresses in a protected memory region. Cross domain function calls are redirected through a software based jump table. Enhancements to the microcontroller call and return instructions use the jump table to track the current active domain. We have implemented our scheme on a VHDL model of ATMEGA103 microcontroller.

While conventional DPM minimizes the energy consumption of the embedded system, it does not utilize the properties of the power source. Alternative power sources such as fuel cells (FCs) have substantially different power and efficiency characteristics that have to be taken into account while developing policies that maximize their operational lifetime. In this paper, we present a new DPM policy for embedded systems powered by FC based hybrid source.

It can enhance circuit timing without detrimental effects on route length and congestion. When applied to IWLS'05 benchmarks, SafeResynth improves circuit delay by 11% on average after routing, while increasing route length and via count by less than 0.2%. Our resynthesis can also be used in an unsafe mode, akin to more traditional physical synthesis algorithms popular in commercial tools.

In contrast with existing stand-alone tools that offer poor interfaces to the design flow and cannot handle a full range of modern VLSI layouts, our ECO-system reliably handles fixed objects and movable macros in instances with widely varying amounts of whitespace.

Researchers in the CAD community have proposed fast and efficient techniques for comprehensive design space exploration to expedite this critical design step. Although these advances have been helpful in reducing the design time significantly, the overall design time of the system is still a bottleneck. All these techniques assume the availability of an initial SoC input model with explicit communication, whose quality significantly impacts the effectiveness of the communication exploration techniques. Today, these initial models need to be manually written by engineers, which is tedious, error-prone and time consuming. In fact, our studies on industrial-size examples have shown that about 50% of the communication exploration time is spent on coding and re-coding of the initial specification model. In this paper, we propose an efficient interactive approach to explicit communication creation by automating some of the common coding tasks in specification models for communication exploration.

A remarkable exception is computer arithmetic and datapath design, where designers still rely mostly on well studied architectures; on datapaths, in most cases, logic synthesis plays at most a minor role in the optimisation of netlists. A case in point is multiple additions performed in carry-save form, such as those fundamentally constituting parallel multipliers: column compressors are usually built exploiting the regularity of the circuit and, due to the very large number of XOR operations, are hardly optimised further by logic synthesisers. In fact, due to the shortcomings of algebraic factoring, XOR operations are usually left untouched by logic synthesisers. In this paper we show a general technique to optimise XOR dominated circuits and we demonstrate its effectiveness on multiplier-like circuits. We show that it optimises significantly the best parallel multipliers by exploiting complex dependencies between the addenda which escape known manual optimisations. Netlists corresponding to top arithmetic architectures can either be synthesised directly or preprocessed through our technique before standard logic synthesis: our preprocessing stage makes it possible to achieve some 20% speed improvement. To our best knowledge, optimisations of the type we show for multiplier-like structures have never been reported - neither manually derived, in computer arithmetic literature, nor automatically derived, in design automation literature.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196098","","Circuit synthesis;Compressors;Computer architecture;Design optimization;Digital arithmetic;Logic circuits;Logic design;Logic functions;Manuals;Synthesizers","digital arithmetic;high level synthesis;logic circuits;logic design;multiplying circuits;optimisation","XOR operations;XOR-dominated circuits;algebraic factoring;carry-save form;column compressors;computer arithmetic;datapath design;digital design;logic synthesis;logic synthesizers;multiplier-like circuits;netlist optimization;parallel multipliers","","6","","19","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These parameters represent numerous local and global variations, and pose a heavy burden in today's chip verification and design. This paper proposes a new way of reducing the statistical variations (which include both process parameters and design variables) according to their impacts on the overall circuit performance. The new approach creates an effective reduction subspace (ERS) and provides a transformation matrix by using the mean and variance of the response surface. With the generated transformation matrix, the proposed method maps the original statistical variations to a smaller set of variables with which we process variability analysis. Thus, the computational cost due to the number of variations is greatly reduced.

However, in order to correctly identify the critical parts of a circuit for optimization, the circuit has to be electrically clean - i.e., slews on each pin have to be within certain limits, a gate cannot drive more than a certain amount of capacitance, etc. Thus far, this requirement has largely been ignored in the literature. Instead, existing methods which optimize delay are used to fix electrical violations. This leads to solutions that are unnecessarily expensive, and still leave violations that remain unfixed. There is therefore a need for an area-efficient strategy that targets the electrical state of a circuit and fixes all violations quickly. This paper explicitly defines ""electrical violations"" and presents a flexible approach (called EVE, the electrical violation eliminator) for fixing these.

Stringent power constraints have led microprocessor designers to incorporate aggressive power saving techniques such as clock-gating, that place a significant burden on the power delivery network. While the application of extensive clock-gating can effectively reduce power consumption, unfortunately, it can also induce large inductive noise (di/dt), resulting in signal integrity and reliability issues. To combat these problems, processors are usually designed for the worst-case current consumption scenario using adequate supply voltage and decoupling capacitances. To tackle high-frequency inductive noise and potential IR drops, we propose a novel design methodology that integrates microarchitectural profiling feedback into the floorplanning process. We present two microarchitectural metrics to quantify the noise susceptibility of a module:self weighting and correlation weighting. By using these metrics in a force-directed floorplanning algorithm to assign power pin affinity to modules, we can quickly converge to a design for average-case current consumption. By designing for the average-case and employing dynamic di/dt control for the worst-case, we can ensure that a chip is noise-tolerant without exceeding decap budget constraints. Our observations showed that certain functional modules in a processor exhibit consistent and highly correlated switching activity, that can be used to guide module placement distance from power pins. The experimental results demonstrate that the force-directed floorplanning technique can effectively suppress supply noise experienced by modules, reduce the total number of supply-noise margin violations, and achieve a floor-plan with considerably lower IR drop, as compared to a wire-length driven floorplan.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196131","","Clocks;Design methodology;Energy consumption;Feedback;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Noise reduction;Power supplies;Process design;Voltage","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise;microprocessor chips;power supply circuits","aggressive power saving techniques;clock-gating;correlation weighting;current consumption;decoupling capacitances;di/dt control;force-directed floorplanning algorithm;inductive noise;microarchitecture profiling;microprocessor designers;noise-direct;power constraints;power consumption reduction;power delivery network;power pin affinity;power supply noise aware floorplanning;self weighting;supply-noise margin violations;wire-length driven floorplan","","7","2","25","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One attractive alternative is to use robust asynchronous circuits which gracefully accommodate timing discrepancies. However, these asynchronous circuits typically suffer from high area and latency overhead. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is presented which reduces the area and delay of these circuits by relaxing their overly-restrictive style. The algorithm was implemented and experiments performed on a subset of MCNC circuits. On average, 49.2% of the gates could be implemented in a relaxed manner, 34.9% area improvement was achieved, and 16.1% delay improvement was achieved using a simple heuristic for targeting the critical path in the circuit.

We show empirically that, for large gate count, the set of all chip designs that share the same high level characteristics have approximately the same leakage, with very small error. Therefore, our model can be used as either an early or a late estimator of leakage, with high accuracy.

Consideration of process variations becomes critical to ensure high parametric timing yield. During the design stage, fast estimation of the achievable buffered delay can navigate more accurate and efficient wire planning and timing analysis in floorplanning or global routing. In this paper, we derive approximated first-order canonical forms for buffered delay estimation which considers the effect of process variations and the presence of buffer blockages. We empirically show that an existing deterministic delay estimation method is over-pessimistic and thus result in unnecessary design rollback. The experimental results also show that our method can estimate buffered delay with 4% average error but achieve up to 149 times speedup when compared to a state-of-the-art statistical buffer insertion method.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196115","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer science;Delay estimation;Distributed computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;State estimation;Timing","delay estimation;integrated circuit design;statistical analysis","buffer blockages;buffered delay estimation;deterministic delay estimation method;first-order canonical forms;process variations;statistical buffer insertion method","","0","","21","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, those changes usually lead to wirelength increases; thus another pass of optimizations to further improve wirelength, timing and routing congestion characteristics is required. Simple wirelength-driven detailed placement techniques could be useful in this scenario. While such techniques can help to reduce wirelength, ones without careful timing constraint considerations might degrade the timing characteristics (worst negative slack, total negative slack, etc) and/or introduce more electrical violations (exceeding maximum output load constraints and maximum input slew constraints). In this paper, we propose a new detailed placement paradigm, which use a set of pin-based timing and electrical constraints in detailed placement to prevent it from degrading timing or violating electrical constraints while reducing wire-length, thus dubbed as Hippocrates: FIRST-DO-NO-HARM optimizations. Our experimental results show great promises. By honoring these constraints, our detailed placement technique not only reduces total wirelength (TWL), but also significantly improves timing, achieving 37% better total negative slack (TNS).","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196022","","Constraint optimization;Degradation;Delay;Design engineering;Design optimization;Interleaved codes;Iterative methods;Routing;Simulated annealing;Timing","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit design;optimisation","Hippocrates;electrical constraints;first-do-no-harm detailed placement;pin-based timing constraint;reduced wire-length;synthesis optimizations","","4","1","24","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we introduce accurate hardware models for addition and subtraction operations in terms of gate-level metrics, under both signed and unsigned representations.

Abstraction-guided simulation has long been a promising framework for leveraging the power of formal techniques to help simulation reach difficult target states (assertion violations or coverage targets): model checking a smaller, abstracted version of the design avoids complexity blow-up, yet computes approximate distances from any state of the actual design to the target; these approximate distances are used during random simulation to guide the simulator. Unfortunately, the performance of previous work has been unreliable-sometimes great, sometimes poor. The problem is the guidance strategy. Because the abstract distances are approximate, a greedy strategy will get stuck in local optima. Previous works expanded the search horizon to try to avoid dead-ends. We explore such heuristics and find that they tend to perform poorly, adding too much search overhead for limited ability to escape dead-ends. Based on these experiments, we propose a new guidance strategy, which pursues a more global search and is better able to avoid getting stuck. Experiments show that our new guidance strategy is highly effective in most cases that are hard for random simulation and beyond the capacity of formal verification.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261145","Algorithms;RTL;Verification;abstraction;model checking;simulation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer science;Computer simulation;Concrete;Formal verification;Logic design;Performance analysis;Permission;State-space methods","circuit simulation;formal verification;logic design","abstraction-guided simulation;formal verification;guidance strategy;model checking;random simulation","","1","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel methodology to solve the problem of run-time power optimization by designing a processor that estimates its own power/energy consumption. Estimation is performed by the addition of small counters that tally events which consume power. This methodology has been applied to an existing processor resulting in an average power error of 2% and energy estimation error of 1.5%. The system adds little impact to the design, with only a 4.9% increase in chip area and a 3% increase in average power consumption.

Knowing the correspondence between ESL arrays and RTL memories can significantly reduce the complexity of a formal equivalence check between the ESL model and the RTL. In practice, however, handling memory mappings in ESL-RTL equivalence checking is non-trivial for the following reasons: first, because of a lack of bit-accurate data-types in the system-level language, the information stored in an array location may be stored in a compressed form in the RTL. Second, a single array in the ESL model may be implemented by multiple memories in the RTL and/or corresponding data items may be stored in different locations. And last but not least, due to timing differences between the ESL model and the RTL, the correspondence between arrays and memories may not hold in every clock cycle. In this paper, we propose an approach to ESL-RTL equivalence checking which can deal with all of these difficulties.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261172","Algorithms;ESL;Equivalence checking;Memory;Verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Design automation;Design engineering;Embedded system;Hardware;Permission;Read-write memory;Registers;Timing","formal specification;memory architecture","formal equivalence checking;memory modeling;register transfer level memory;register transfer level model;single array;system-level language;system-level model;system-level specification","","0","","9","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To help fill this gap, we study a patented placement method for the X architecture; to our knowledge, there have been no prior published results for the method. Surprisingly, we find that the patented method in fact performs worse than traditional Manhattan methods - for both Manhattan and X routing metrics. We also present a theoretic formulation which explains why solution quality is degraded. Many groups in industry are evaluating the merits of non-Manhattan routing architectures.

This provides significant advantages in synthesis by reducing circuit size and provides additional flexibility in technology mapping, which could be crucial in post-synthesis optimizations. Furthermore, it is also critical in verification because it can reduce the complexity of the netlist to be analyzed in equivalence checking. Most algorithms available so far for this goal do not exploit observability don't cares (ODCs) for node merging since nodes equivalent up to ODCs do not form an equivalence relation. Although a few recently proposed solutions can exploit ODCs by overcoming this limitation, they constrain their analysis to just a few levels of surrounding logic to avoid prohibitive runtime. We develop an ODC-based node merging algorithm that performs efficient global ODC analysis (considering the entire netlist) through simulation and SAT. Our contributions which enable global ODC-based optimizations are: (1) a fast ODC-aware simulator and (2) an incremental verification strategy that limits computational complexity. In addition, our technique operates on arbitrarily mapped netlists, allowing for powerful post-synthesis optimizations. We show that global ODC analysis discovers on average 25% more (and up to 60%) node-merging opportunities than current state-of-the-art solutions based on local ODC analysis.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196067","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Computational modeling;Corporate acquisitions;Flexible printed circuits;Logic;Merging;Observability;Performance analysis;Runtime","equivalent circuits;logic design","ODC;SAT sweeping;computational complexity;incremental verification;node mergers;post synthesis optimizations","","16","1","17","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under the context of timing analysis, the need for combating process variations has sparkled a growing body of statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) techniques. While first-order SSTA techniques enjoy good runtime efficiency desired for tackling large industrial designs, more accurate second-order SSTA techniques have been proposed to improve the analysis accuracy, but at the cost of high computational complexity. Although many sources of variations may impact the circuit performance, considering a large number of inter-die and intra-die variations in the traditional SSTA analysis is very challenging. In this paper, we address the analysis complexity brought by high parameter dimensionality in static timing analysis and propose an accurate yet fast second-order SSTA algorithm based upon novel parameter dimension reduction. By developing reduced-rank regression based parameter reduction algorithms within block-based SSTA flow, we demonstrate that accurate second order SSTA analysis can be extended to a much higher parameter dimensionality than what is possible before. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed parameter reduction can achieve up to 10X parameter dimension reduction and lead to significantly improved second-order SSTA analysis under a large set of process variations.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261180","Algorithms;Statistical timing;parameter dimension reduction;performance;process variation;verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit analysis;Circuit optimization;Computational efficiency;Context modeling;Performance analysis;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Runtime;Timing","VLSI;computational complexity;network analysis;regression analysis","computational complexity;fast second-order statistical static timing analysis;nanometer VLSI design;parameter dimension reduction;parameter dimensionality;reduced-rank regression","","2","3","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cell-wise OPC is an attractive technique to reduce the mask data size as well as the prohibitive runtime of full-chip OPC. As feature dimensions have gotten smaller, the radius of influence for edge features has extended further into neighboring cells such that it is no longer sufficient to perform cellwise OPC independent of neighboring cells, especially for the critical layers. The methodology described in this work accounts for features in neighboring cells and allows a cellwise approach to be applied to cells with a printed gate length of 45nm with the projection that it can also be applied to future technology nodes. OPC-ready cells are generated at library creation (independent of placement) using a boundary-based technique. Each cell has a tractable number of OPC-ready versions due to an intelligent characterization of standard cell layout features. Total number of cells with boundaries in the OPC-ready library only increases linearly with the number of cells in the original library. Results are very promising: the average edge placement error (EPE) for all metal1 features in 100 layouts is 0.731nm which is less than 1 % of metal1 width, creating similar levels of lithographic accuracy while obviating any of the drawbacks inherent in layout specific full-chip model-based OPC.

In this paper, we analyze and model the impact of the metal dummy on the signal capacitance with various parameters including their electrical characteristic, signal dimensions, and dummy shape and dimensions. Fill has differing impact on interconnects depending on whether the signal of interest is in the same layer as the fill or not. In particular intra-layer dummy has its greatest impact on coupling capacitance while inter-layer dummy has more impact on the ground capacitance component. Based on an analysis of fill impact on capacitance, we propose simple capacitance increment models (Cc for intra-layer dummy and Cg for inter-layer dummy). To consider the realistic case with both signals and metal fill in adjacent layers, we apply a weighting function approach in the ground capacitance model. We verify this model using simple test patterns and benchmark circuits and find that the models match well with field solver results (1.2% average error with much faster runtime than commercial extraction tools, the runtime overhead reduced by ~75% for all benchmark circuits).","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196074","","Benchmark testing;Capacitance;Circuit testing;Dielectrics;Integrated circuit interconnections;Process design;Runtime;Semiconductor device modeling;Shape;Signal analysis","filler metals;integrated circuit interconnections","benchmark circuits;capacitance increment;dummy dimensions;dummy shape;electrical characteristic;inter level dielectric thickness planarity;metal dummy;metal fill insertion;signal capacitance;signal dimensions;simple test patterns;weighting function","","11","","22","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sizes of these files makes the use of proofs of un- satisfiability impractical for industrial tools. Although only a small part of the resolve trace is eventually used, until now it was not known how to filter out unnecessary information. We propose a simple algorithm for on-the-fly resolve trace minimization in which we identify clauses that are guaranteed not to take part in the proof of unsatisfiability, and delete all of their associated information. This algorithm dramatically decreases the size of the resolve trace, to the point where it can be stored in the main memory.

The objective of the targeting problem is to minimize the average flow time of a set of jobs under a given energy constraint, where the flow time of a job is defined as the interval length between the arrival and the completion of the job. We consider two types of processors, which have a continuous spectrum of the available speeds or have only a finite number of discrete speeds. Two algorithms are given: (1) An algorithm is proposed to derive optimal solutions for processors with a continuous spectrum of the available speeds. (2) A greedy algorithm is designed for the derivation of optimal solutions for processors with a finite number of discrete speeds.

The goal is to compute the timing slack distribution for the nodes in the timing graph and identify the statistically critical paths under retiming, which are the paths with a high probability of becoming timing-critical after retiming. SRTA enables the designers to perform circuit optimization on these paths to reduce the probability of them becoming timing bottleneck if the circuit is retimed as a post-process. We provide a comparison among static timing analysis (=STA), statistical timing analysis (=SSTA), retiming-based timing analysis (=RTA), and our statistical retiming-based timing analysis (SRTA).

To achieve minimum energy operation, the netlist topology of the ESB bus should however be optimized accordingly. In this paper we present a strategy for the definition of an energy optimal netlist for the ESB bus. An initial floorplanning stage provides information about the eventual lengths of the interconnect wires and a subsequent exploration step defines the optimal topology for the communication architecture.

Regular structures like arrays and rows are defined on a single-sequence that is a kind of standard representation of a sequence-pair. We extract regular structures from a single-sequence in 0(n), and then evaluate the structures by quantifying the regularity as an objective function. Besides, we propose a new simulated annealing (SA) framework, called dual SA, where we convey a constructive feature to an SA framework, so that it attains a placement balancing the size of regular structures against the area efficiency. In experiments, we apply our structured placement to analog block designs, and reveal the definite advantage that our placements contain many regular structures such as rows and arrays without increasing the chip area and the wire length, compared to the existing placement.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196034","","Circuit optimization;Degradation;Humans;Signal design;Simulated annealing;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Temperature;Topology;Wire","analogue circuits;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","analog block designs;block placement;floorplanning;placement balancing;simulated annealing;structured placement;topological regularity evaluation","","2","1","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We develop efficient algorithms to perform all statistical atomic operations (such as max and add) efficiently via either closed- form formulas or one-dimensional lookup tables. The resulting timing quantity provably preserves the correlation with variation sources to the third-order.

If the CEC engine formulates the problem as a single SAT instance (call this naive), one can use the resolution proof of unsatisfiability as a proof of equivalence. However, a modern CEC engine does not directly invoke a SAT solver for the whole miter, but instead uses a variety of techniques such as structural hashing, detection of intermediate functional equivalences, and circuit re-writing to first simplify the problem. We show that in spite of using these simplification techniques, a CEC engine can be modified to generate a single (extended) resolution proof for the whole miter just as in the naive case. The benefit of having a single proof is that the proof verification program remains extremely simple, and its correctness is much easier to establish than that of the CEC engine.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261253","Algorithms;Theory;Verification;equivalence checking;resolution proofs;transformation-based verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Engines;Logic design;Permission","computability;equivalence classes;program verification;rewriting systems;theorem proving","SAT solver;circuit re-writing;combinational equivalence checking engines;intermediate functional equivalences;proof verification program;resolution proofs;unsatisfiability","","1","","17","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, all recent works on wire pipelining assume pre-pipelined components and consider only inserting pipeline stages on point-to-point wire or bus connections. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first that considers block pipelining and interconnect pipelining simultaneously. We optimize multiple critical paths or loops in the micro-architecture and insert the pipelines stages optimally in the blocks and wires of these loops to meet the clock frequency requirement. We propose two approaches to this problem. The first approach is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) which is theoretically guaranteed to produce the optimal solution, and the second one is an efficient graph-based algorithm that produces near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that simultaneous block and interconnect pipelining leads to more than 20% improvement over wire-pipelining alone on the overall processor performance. Moreover, the graph-based approach gives solutions very close to the MILP results ( 2% more than MILP results on average) but in a much shorter runtime.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196153","","Clocks;Computer science;Delay;Design optimization;Flip-flops;Frequency;Pipeline processing;Table lookup;Throughput;Wire","circuit optimisation;graph theory;integer programming;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;linear programming;pipeline processing","block pipelining;graph-based algorithm;graph-based approach;interconnect pipelining;microarchitecture pipelining optimization;mixed integer linear programming;throughput-aware floorplanning;wire pipelining","","4","","24","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to the existing approaches, SSCA has several considerable merits. Firstly, compared with the moment-matching parameterized model order reduction (PMOR), which equally treats the circuit response on process variables and frequency parameter by Taylor approximation, SSCA employs homogeneous chaos to capture the impact of process variations with exponential convergence rate and adopts Fourier series or wavelet bases to model the steady-state behavior in time domain. Secondly, contrary to stochastic Galerkin algorithm (SGA), which is efficient for stochastic linear system analysis, the complexity of SSCA is much smaller than that of SGA for nonlinear case. Thirdly, different from efficient collocation method, the heuristic approach which may results in ""rank deficient problem"" and ""Runge phenomenon"", sparse grid technique is developed to select the collocation points in SSCA in order to reduce the complexity while guaranteing the approximation accuracy. Furthermore, though SSCA is proposed for the stochastic nonlinear steady-state analysis, it can be applied for any other kinds of nonlinear system simulation with process variations, such as transient analysis, etc.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196077","","Algorithm design and analysis;Chaos;Circuits;Convergence;Fourier series;Frequency;Nonlinear systems;Steady-state;Stochastic systems;Wavelet domain","approximation theory;nonlinear network analysis;stochastic processes","PMOR;SSCA;Taylor approximation;homogeneous chaos;moment matching;nonlinear system;parameterized model order reduction;periodic steady state analysis;process variations;stochastic collocation algorithm;stochastic sparse grid collocation algorithm","","8","","16","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its increasing acceptance is driven by the increasing complexity of designs, pushing designers to higher and higher levels of abstractions. While a major goal of SystemC is to enable verification at higher level of abstraction, enabling early exploration of system-level designs, the focus so far has been on traditional dynamic validation techniques. It is fair to see that the development of formal-verification techniques for SystemC models is at its infancy. In spite of intensive recent activity in the development of formal-verification techniques for software, extending such techniques to SystemC is a formidable challenge. The difficulty stems from both the object-oriented nature of SystemC, which is fundamental to its modeling philosophy, and its sophisticated event-driven simulation semantics. In this position paper we discuss what is needed to develop formal techniques for SystemC verification, augmenting dynamic validation techniques. By formal techniques we refer here to a range of techniques, including assertion-based dynamic validation, symbolic simulation, formal test generation, explicit-state model checking, and symbolic model checking.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261169","Formal Verification;High-Level Model;Verification","Computational modeling;Computer bugs;Design engineering;Discrete event simulation;Distributed computing;Hardware;Object oriented modeling;Permission;System-level design;Testing","C language;formal verification","SystemC verification;assertion-based dynamic validation;explicit-state model checking;formal test generation;formal-verification techniques;symbolic model checking;symbolic simulation;system-level designs","","0","1","36","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike many traditional approaches that assume Normal performance distributions, the proposed approach is especially developed to handle multiple correlated non-Normal performance distributions, thereby providing better accuracy than other traditional techniques. Starting from a set of quadratic performance models, the proposed parametric yield extraction conceptually maps multiple correlated performance constraints to a single auxiliary constraint using a MAX(ldr) operator. As such, the parametric yield is uniquely determined by the probability distribution of the auxiliary constraint and, therefore, can be easily computed. In addition, a novel second-order statistical Taylor expansion is proposed for an analytical MAX(ldr) approximation, facilitating fast yield estimation. Our numerical examples in a commercial BiCMOS process demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides 2~3times error reduction compared with a Normal- distribution-based method, while achieving orders of magnitude more efficiency than the Monte Carlo analysis with 10<sup>4</sup> samples.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261316","Algorithms;Analog/RF Circuits;Parametric Yield","Algorithm design and analysis;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Costs;Large-scale systems;Linear approximation;Monte Carlo methods;Permission;Radio frequency;Response surface methodology;Yield estimation","Monte Carlo methods;analogue integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;correlation methods;numerical analysis;radiofrequency integrated circuits;statistical distributions","MAX(ldr) operator;Monte Carlo analysis;analog-RF circuits;multiple correlated nonnormal performance distributions;parametric yield extraction;probability distribution;second-order statistical Taylor expansion","","0","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, high-quality and fast global routers are in great demand. In this paper, we propose two major techniques to improve the extremely fast global router, FastRoute (Pan and Chu, 2006) in terms of solution quality : (1) monotonic routing, (2) multi-source multi-sink maze routing. The new router is called FastRoute 2.0. Experimental results show that FastRoute 2.0 can generate high-quality routing solutions with fast runtime compared with three state-of-the-art academic global routers FastRoute, Labyrinth (Kastner et al., 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (Hadsell and Madden, 2003). On the set of benchmarks used in Pan and Chu, 2006 and Hadsell and Madden (2003), the total overflow of FastRoute 2.0 is 98, compared to 1012 (FastRoute), 2846 (Labyrinth) and 1271 (Chi Dispersion Router). The runtime of FastRoute 2.0 is 73% slower than FastRoute, but 78times and 37times faster than Labyrinth and Chi Dispersion router. The promising results make it possible to integrate global routing into early design stages. This could dramatically improve the design solution quality.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196040","","Clocks;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Runtime;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces;Wire","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","FastRoute 2.0;advanced IC technology;design solution quality;extremely fast global router;high-quality routing solutions;monotonic routing;multisource multisink maze routing","","38","1","19","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, 3D IC technology can be used to realize heterogeneous system-on-chip design, by integrating different modules together with less interference with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel thermal-aware 3D cell placement approach, named T3Place, based on transforming a 2D placement with good wirelength to a 3D placement, with the objectives of half-perimeter wirelength, through-the-silicon (TS) via number and temperature. T3Place is composed of two steps, transformation from a 2D placement to a 3D placement and the refinement of the resulting 3D placement. We proposed and compared several different transformation techniques, including local stacking transformation (LST), folding-2, folding-4 and window-based stacking/folding transformation, and concluded that (i) LST can generate 3D placements with the least wirelength, (ii) the folding-based transformations result in 3D placements with the fewest TS vias, and (iii) the window-based stacking/folding transformations provide good TS via number and wirelength tradeoffs. For example, with four device layers, LST can reduce the wirelength by over 2times compared to the initial 2D placement, while window-based stacking/folding can provide over 10times variation in terms of the TS via number, thus adaptive to different manufacturing ability for TS via density. Moreover, we proposed a novel relaxed conflict-net (RCN) graph-based layer assignment method to further refine the 3D placements. Compared to LST results, thermal-aware RCN graph-based layer assignment algorithm (r = 10%) can further reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 37%, with only 6% TS via number increase and 8% wirelength increase.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196130","","Energy consumption;Fabrication;Integrated circuit interconnections;Packaging;Radio frequency;Stacking;System-on-a-chip;Temperature;Thermal conductivity;Three-dimensional integrated circuits","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;power consumption;system-on-chip","2D placement;T3Place;folding-2;folding-4;local stacking transformation;power consumption;relaxed conflict-net graph-based layer assignment method;system-on-chip design;thermal-aware 3D IC placement;window-based stacking/folding transformation;wirelength reduction","","48","","21","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a flow-through-queue (FTQ) based power management method, which allows some of the tasks involved in processing the frame data to be offloaded. This in turn enables utilization of multiple clock rates and multiple voltages for different cores inside the Ethernet controller. A modeling approach based on semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and queuing models is employed, which allow one to apply mathematical programming formulations for energy optimization under performance constraints.

Static WCET analysis requires program path analysis and microarchitecture modeling. Despite almost two decades of research, WCET analysis has not enjoyed wide acceptance in industry. This is in part due to the difficulty in microarchitecture modeling of modern processors. Given the large number of embedded processors available in the market, retargetability of the WCET analysis framework is a serious issue. In this paper, we address it using architecture description language (ADL). Starting with the ADL of a target processor, the proposed framework automatically generates graph-based execution models to capture timing effects of instructions in the pipeline.

In this paper, we propose efficient modeling techniques for analyzing power distribution in deep sub micron (DSM) ASIC designs.

A basic prerequisite for the new approach are CMOS standard libraries that are pre-characterized with respect to the corresponding modeling requirements. This paper also presents an approach for this characterization step. The proposed techniques can efficiently handle multiple-input-switching (MIS), including single-input-switching events (SIS) and provide good analysis results compared to the reference with two orders of magnitude speedup, although the cell library pre-characterization is based on SPICE simulations. Our model is independent of the power network context, which implies that different power distribution networks may be analyzed based on the same model and the same cell characterizations.

The proposed power management techniques in the literature for implementing distributed power managers in multi-processor systems are very costly in terms of hardware and software modifications. For example, extra software code for power management must be integrated into each component of the system. Furthermore, in order to turn on a component at a specific time/event, extra hardware timers and interrupt controllers must be added to each component along with proper software/device driver modifications. In this paper, we propose a new centralized power management technique that reduces the power consumption of distributed realtime systems at very low implementation cost. Our power manager does not need software and hardware modifications of each individual component. Instead, it uses the model of the system/application to compute the schedule of turning on/off commands by dynamically simulating the system for a given application scenario. The dynamic simulation can be conservative to reflect the jitter in arrival time of events and/or variation in execution delay of tasks. We applied our power management technique to a distributed software-defined radio system and achieved significant energy savings (60% to 87%) at the cost of 1% energy consumed by the power manager itself, as verified by actual hardware measurements. Furthermore, our power manager reacts to the changes in application scenario (referred to as mission) within milliseconds.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196145","","Application software;Computational modeling;Costs;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy management;Hardware;Power system management;Radio spectrum management;Real time systems","integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;real-time systems","distributed real-time systems;distributed software-defined radio system;hardware measurements;hardware modifications;hardware timers;interrupt controllers;low-power embedded systems;multiprocessor systems;power constraints;power management;power manager;software modifications;software/device driver","","0","","17","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The short circuit current is highly dependent on the input and output voltage values. Therefore the actual shape of the voltage signal waveforms at the input and output of the cell should be considered in order to precisely calculate the short circuit energy dissipation. Previous approaches such as the approximation of the crosstalk induced noisy waveforms with saturated ramps can lead to short circuit energy estimation errors as high as an order of magnitude for a minimum sized inverter. To resolve this shortcoming, a current-based logic cell model is utilized, which constructs the output voltage waveform for a given noisy input waveform. The input and output voltage waveforms are then used to calculate the short circuit current, and hence, short circuit energy dissipation. A characterization process is executed for each logic cell in the standard cell library to model the relevant electrical parameters e.g., the parasitic capacitances and nonlinear current sources. Additionally, our model is capable of calculating the short circuit energy dissipation caused by glitches in VLSI circuits, which in some cases can be a key contributor to the total circuit energy dissipation. Experimental results show an average error of about 1% and a maximum error of 3% compared to SPICE for different types of logic cells under noisy input waveforms including glitches while the runtime speedup is up to a factor of 16,000.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196129","","Circuit noise;Crosstalk;Energy dissipation;Estimation error;Inverters;Logic circuits;Noise shaping;Shape;Short circuit currents;Voltage","SPICE;VLSI;logic circuits;logic design","SPICE;VLSI circuits;crosstalk induced noisy waveforms;current-based logic cell model;current-based method;inverter;logic cells;noisy input waveforms;short circuit current;short circuit energy dissipation;short circuit power calculation","","5","3","18","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, devices are increasingly required to store confidential information. This includes data such as cryptographic keys, personal information, and the intellectual property (IP) in the device's design. Furthermore, computing systems in critical applications must work as specified. Therefore it is important that hardware be designed and fabricated to be trustworthy. Many potential attacks can be used to exploit a computing device. Physical attacks, that monitor power, timing, electromagnetic radiation, etc. can be used to steal confidential information from the system. A ""malicious"" foundry can perform a number of devious activities including stealing the mask, reverse engineering IP, subverting the hardware through back doors and time bombs, and overproducing counterfeit chips. Design tools can be subverted to insert malicious circuitry, and chip packagers can modify selected devices with their own that provide similar functionality, in addition to underhanded behavior, e.g. stealing information or malfunctioning at critical junctures. The notions of trust and trustworthiness are presented.

One is called launch off capture and the other is called launch off shift. Launch off shift test method has the advantage that it provides higher fault coverage at reduced test generation time and test pattern counts. However a concern expressed often in the literature is the potential over testing or yield loss caused by the fact that launch off shift operates the circuit under test in non-functional manner. In this paper we present data, for the first time, which points to another potential problem with launch off shift tests. The data presented for ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits shows that a considerable numbers of functionally detectable transition delay faults are not detected by the normally used launch off shift tests that use a single fault activation cycle. Functionally detectable faults that escape tests could cause circuit malfunction in normal operation. Thus launch off shift tests when used in manufacturing test may result in test escapes. We also present data that shows that if launch off shift tests with multiple fault activation cycles are used essentially all functionally detectable faults can be detected.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196136","","Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Cities and towns;Delay;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Lab-on-a-chip;Manufacturing;Test pattern generators","automatic test pattern generation;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing","ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits;circuit under test;detect delay faults test;fault coverage;launch off capture test;launch off shift test;scan designs;single fault activation cycle;test generation time;test pattern counts;transition delay faults","","2","","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, in this paper we propose a novel system level leakage aware floorplanner (LEAF) which optimizes floorplans for temperature-aware leakage power along with the traditional metrics of area and wire length. Our floorplanner takes a SoC netlist and the dynamic power profile of functional blocks to determine a placement while optimizing for temperature dependent leakage power, area, and wire length. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LEAF, we implemented our methodology on ten industrial SoC designs from Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and evaluated the trade-off between leakage power and area.

The widely used RET called off-axis illumination (OAI) introduces forbidden pitches which lead to very complex design rules. It has been observed that imposing uniformity on layout designs can substantially improve printability under OAI. For metal layers, uniformity can be achieved simply by inserting dummy metal wire segments at all free spaces. Simulation results indeed show significant improvement in printability with such a dummy metal insertion approach. To minimize mask cost, it is advantageous to use dummy metal segments that are of the same size as regular metal wires due to their simple geometry. But these dummy wires are printable and hence increase coupling capacitances and potentially affect yield. The alternative is to use a set of parallel sub-resolution thin wires (which is not printed) to replace a printable dummy wire segment. These invisible dummy metal segments do not increase coupling capacitances but bring a higher lithography cost, which includes mask cost and RET/process expense. This paper presents a strategy for dummy metal insertion that can optimally trade off lithography cost and coupling capacitance. In particular, we present an optimal algorithm that can minimize lithography cost subject to any given coupling capacitance bound. Moreover, this dummy metal insertion achieves a highly uniform density because of the locality of coupling capacitance, which automatically ameliorates chemical mechanical polish (CMP) problem.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195989","","Capacitance;Chip scale packaging;Cost function;Coupling circuits;Geometry;Integrated circuit manufacture;Integrated circuit technology;Lighting;Lithography;Wires","costing;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit metallisation;nanolithography","chemical mechanical polish;coupling-aware dummy metal insertion;forbidden pitches;integrated circuits manufacturing technology;invisible dummy metal segments;lithography cost minimization;off-axis illumination;optimal algorithm;printability improvement;resolution enhancement techniques","","4","1","15","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It appears that existing SIMD functional units are designed in an area optimal, but not energy optimal way.

The fabrication and integration cost of these devices, however, have been prohibitive and/or the devices do not allow smooth transition from the conventional design paradigm. To address some of these limitations, we have developed a new family of devices called ""complementary nano electro-mechanical switches"" (CNEMS) using carbon nanotubes as active switching/latching elements. The basic structure of these devices consists of three coplanar carbon nanotubes arranged so that the central nanotube can touch the two side carbon nanotubes upon application of a voltage pulse between them. Owing to the unique properties of carbon nanotubes, these devices have very low leakage current, low operation voltages, and have built-in energy storage to reduce computation power, resulting in very low overall power dissipation. CNEMS have stable on-off state and latching mechanism for non-volatile memory-mode operation. Besides, the devices can be readily integrated in the same substrate as CMOS transistors with high integration densities - thus, allowing easy manufacturability and hybridization with conventional CMOS devices. In this paper, we present the properties of these devices and based on our analysis, we propose a reconfigurable computation framework using these devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that these devices are promising in dynamically reconfigurable instant-on system development with about 25times lower power dissipation.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196001","","Carbon nanotubes;Chemical elements;Costs;Fabrication;Geometry;Nanoscale devices;Power dissipation;Scalability;Switches;Voltage","carbon nanotubes;field programmable gate arrays;low-power electronics;microswitches;random-access storage;reconfigurable architectures","CMOS transistors;CNEMS;built-in energy storage;complementary nanoelectromechanical carbon nanotube switches;coplanar carbon nanotubes;latching mechanism;leakage current;low operation voltages;nonvolatile memory-mode operation;reconfigurable instant-on system;stable on-off state;system development;ultralow-power reconfigurable computing","","3","1","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, it is desired that statistical circuit analysis and optimization can be conducted based upon imprecise statistical variation models. In this paper, we present an efficient importance sampling based optimization framework that can translate the uncertainty in the process models to the uncertainty in parametric yield, thus offering the very much desired statistical best/worst-case circuit analysis capability accounting for unavoidable complexity in process characterization. Unlike the previously proposed statistical learning and probabilistic interval based techniques, our new technique efficiently computes tight bounds of the parametric circuit yields based upon bounds of statistical process model parameters while fully capturing correlation between various process variations. Furthermore, our new technique provides valuable guidance to process characterization.

Building software for such large complex memories with many of the software components as individually optimized software IPs is a big challenge. In order to obtain good performance and a reduction in memory stalls, the data buffers of the application need to be placed carefully in different types of memory.

We show the feasibility and advantages of this shunt resistor scheme by a real design case of single-ended microstrip line in 0.10mum technology.

"Timing-Aware Decoupling Capacitance Allocation in Power Distribution Networks","Pant, S.; Blaauw, D.","Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI","Design Automation Conference, 2007. ASP-DAC '07. Asia and South Pacific","20070507","2007","","","757","762","Power supply noise increases the circuit delay, which may lead to performance failure of a design. Decoupling capacitance (decap) addition is effective in reducing the power supply noise, thus making the supply network more robust in presence of large switching currents. Traditionally, decaps have been allocated in order to minimize the worst-case voltage drop occurring in the power grid. In this paper, we propose an approach for timing-aware decap allocation which uses global time slacks to drive the decap optimization. Non-critical gates with larger timing slacks can tolerate a relatively higher supply voltage drop as compared to the gates on the critical paths. The decap allocation is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem using Lagrangian relaxation, and modified adjoint method is used to efficiently obtain the sensitivities of objective function to decap sizes. A fast path-based heuristic is also implemented and compared with the global optimization formulation. The two approaches have been implemented and tested on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits and with grids of different sizes. Compared to uniformly allocated decaps, the proposed approach utilizes 35.5% less total decap to meet the same delay target. For the same total decap budget, the proposed approach is shown to improve the circuit delay by 10.1% on an average.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196126","","Capacitance;Circuit noise;Circuit testing;Delay;Noise reduction;Noise robustness;Power grids;Power supplies;Power systems;Voltage","circuit noise;distribution networks;optimisation;power grids;power supply circuits","ISCAS85 benchmark circuits;Lagrangian relaxation;adjoint method;circuit delay;global optimization;noncritical gates;nonlinear optimization;power distribution networks;power supply noise;switching currents;timing slacks;timing-aware decoupling capacitance allocation","","6","2","16","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DAC '07. 44th ACM/IEEE","20070625","2007","","","xii","xii","The semiconductor industry currently faces serious challenges and changes on both the business and technology fronts. The business environment is becoming more difficult. The huge investment required for new fabrication facilities is forcing many IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers) to change their business model to either fablite or fabless. The significant costs to develop the next generation process technologies are necessitating joint development between various companies. Furthermore, due to severe competition in the mobile and digital consumer markets, low chip prices and short time-to-market are both essential for survival. To satisfy these market requirements, heavy R&D expenses and resources are needed. However, its return on investment is becoming marginal and even uncertain. To overcome this difficult situation, the industry is experiencing consolidation of once proudly independent companies. On the technical side, controlling chip yield, power consumption and design complexity have become extremely difficult in the nano-technology era. This talk will present a perspective on how the semiconductor industry must respond to these challenges by developing new markets, new products, and new technologies. The solutions will come from (i) collaborations with key customers for new markets and products, as well as, with key partners for new technologies, and (ii) technology breakthroughs with innovative ideas, such as 3-D package, fusion technologies (OneDRAM, OneNAND), variation-tolerant designs, and low leakage devices. These approaches can lead to lower chip costs and relieve physical uncertainty problems.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261125","","","","","","0","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples of such designs abound in DSP for audio, video and multimedia computations where the input and output bit-vector sizes are dictated by the desired precision. A bit-vector of size m represents integer values reduced modulo 2m(%2m). Therefore, finite word-length bit-vector arithmetic can be modeled as algebra over finite integer rings, where the bit-vector size dictates the ring cardinality. This paper demonstrates how the number-theoretic properties of finite integer rings can be exploited for optimization of bit-vector arithmetic. Along with an analytical model to estimate the implementation cost at RTL, two algorithms are presented to optimize bit-vector arithmetic. Experimental results, conducted within practical CAD settings, demonstrate significant area savings due to our approach.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196083","","Algebra;Circuit synthesis;Computational modeling;Costs;Digital arithmetic;Digital signal processing;Mathematical model;Polynomials;Power system modeling;Signal processing algorithms","CAD;digital arithmetic;polynomial approximation;vectors","CAD;area optimization;arithmetic datapaths;bit vectors;finite integer rings;finite word length;operands;polynomial computations","","0","","23","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is shown that using splitting on interconnect can reduce the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) induced dishing effect and can result in decrease at an average of 5% in mean interconnect delay in addition to its variation.

The main factor preventing the covering problem's migration to other logic transformations, such as elimination and resynthesis region identification found in SIS and FBDD, is the exponential number of alternative cuts that have to be evaluated. Traditional methods of cut generation do not scale beyond a cut size of 6. In this paper, a symbolic method that can enumerate all cuts is proposed without any pruning, up to a cut size of 10. We show that it can outperform traditional methods by an order of magnitude and, as a result, scales to 100K gate benchmarks. As a practical driver, the covering problem applied to elimination is shown where it can not only produce competitive area, but also provide more than 6times average runtime reduction of the total runtime in FBDD, a BDD based logic synthesis tool with a reported order of magnitude faster runtime than SIS and commercial tools with negligible impact on area.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196066","","Application software;Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Data structures;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Logic;Runtime;Table lookup","logic CAD","BddCut;FBDD;covering algorithm;logic synthesis;logic transformations;resynthesis region identification;scalable method;symbolic cut enumeration","","0","3","17","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our algorithm keeps the solution lists short, and always achieves higher yield than the deterministic buffering.

The key enabler for efficient optimization is a fast localized node-based iterative method to compute the voltages after each movement of pads. Experimental results show that our algorithm demonstrates good runtime characteristics for power grids with large numbers of pad candidates in multi-million-size circuits.

The analysis results are used to make our approach low-cost both from a software performance penalty and a hardware area point-of-view.

It is found that a significant portion of this power is wasted during wrong path execution and non power optimal allocation of power hungry resources. Dynamic reconfiguration of micro-architectural resources can be exploited to bring down this waste at runtime. Lack of architectural method to capture the behavior of a program at runtime makes dynamic reconfiguration a challenge. In this paper we propose a method to characterize program behavior at runtime using conflict miss pattern of a data cache, which in turn identifies different program phases in terms of cache utilization. We use this phase information to enable/disable cache ways dynamically depending on the conflict miss pattern of a program. Using a hardware tracking mechanism we ensure that the program performance (throughput in terms of IPC) does not degrade beyond a tolerable limit. Through simulation we establish that an average improvement of 32% (best case 38%) in cache power saving is achieved at the expense of less than 2% degradation in performance for SPEC-CPU and MEDIA benchmarks. The additional hardware that detects and captures the phase information is outside the critical path of the processor and does not contribute to the overall delay.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196147","","Degradation;Electronic mail;Hardware;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Phase detection;Power engineering and energy;Resource management;Runtime;Sun","cache storage;power consumption;reconfigurable architectures","conflict miss pattern;data cache;dynamic cache way reconfiguration;hardware tracking mechanism;phase information;power efficiency","","2","1","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the complexity of these systems increases, reduced order modeling becomes critical. In this paper, we develop a new method for the model order reduction of interconnect using frequency restrictive selection of interpolation points based on the spectral-zeros of the RLC interconnect model's transfer function. The methodology uses the imaginary part of spectral zeros for frequency selective projection and provides stable as well as passive reduced order models for interconnect in VLSI systems. For large order interconnect models with realistic RLC parameters, the results indicate that our method provides more accurate approximations than techniques based on balanced truncation and moment matching with excellent agreement with the original system's transfer function.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196061","","Frequency;High speed integrated circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Interpolation;Iterative methods;Large-scale systems;Stability;Transfer functions;Very large scale integration","RLC circuits;VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;interpolation;reduced order systems;transfer functions","RLC interconnect model;VLSI system performance;balanced truncation;frequency restrictive selection;frequency selective model order reduction;interpolation points;moment matching;passive reduced order models;process technology;spectral zero projection;transfer function","","2","","21","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to previous approaches that address either test data compression or abort-on-fail testing, we propose an architecture for combined test data compression and abort-on-fail testing. The architecture improves throughput through multi-site testing as the ATE memory requirement is constant and independent of the degree of multi-site testing. For flexibility in modifying the test data at any time, we make use of a test program for decompression; only test independent evaluation logic is added to the IC. Major advantages compared to MISR (multiple-input signature register) based schemes are that our scheme (1) allows abort-on-fail testing at clock-cycle granularity, (2) does not impact diagnostic capabilities, and (3) needs no special care for the handling of unknowns (X).","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196119","","Application specific integrated circuits;Automatic test equipment;Automatic testing;Circuit testing;Clocks;Integrated circuit testing;Logic testing;Registers;Test data compression;Throughput","automatic test equipment;data compression;integrated circuit testing;logic testing","ATE memory requirement;abort-on-fail test;automatic test equipment;clock-cycle granularity;integrated circuit testing;multi-site testing;multiple-input signature register;test data compression;test independent evaluation logic","","3","","8","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such leaky transistors may even change position with changes in the operating voltage and temperature, and hence, redundancy at circuit-level is not sufficient to tolerate such threats to yield. We show that in SRAM cells this leakage depends on the cell value and propose a first software-based runtime technique that suppresses such abnormal leakages by storing safe values in the corresponding cache lines before going to standby mode. Analysis shows the performance penalty is, in the worst case, linearly dependent to the number of so-cured cache lines while the energy saving linearly increases by the time spent in standby mode. Analysis and experimental results on commercial processors confirm that the technique is viable if the standby duration is more than a small fraction of a second.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196146","","Circuits;Degradation;Large scale integration;Manufacturing;Performance analysis;Random access memory;Redundancy;Runtime;Temperature;Threshold voltage","SRAM chips;cache storage;integrated circuit yield;microprocessor chips","cache lines;process variation;processor chips;software technique;software-based runtime technique;ultra-leaky SRAM cells","","0","4","20","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel metal filling algorithm that seeks to minimize the thickness range of the chip surface during the copper damascene process. The proposed solution considers the physical mechanisms in the damascene process, namely ECP (which is the process used to deposit Cu in the trenches) and CMP (which is the process used to polish Cu after ECP), that affect thickness range. Key predictors for the final thickness range, which is the thickness range after ECP and CMP, that can be computed efficiently are identified and used to drive the metal filling process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first metal filling algorithm that uses an ECP model among other things to guide metal filling. Experimental results are very promising and indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the thickness range after metal filling. This is in sharp contrast with the density-driven approaches which often increase the thickness range after metal filling, thereby potentially adversely impacting yield. In addition, the proposed method inserts significantly smaller amount of fill when compared to the density-driven approaches. This is desirable as it limits the impact of metal filling on timing.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195987","","Copper;Dielectric materials;Fabrication;Filling;Inorganic materials;Planarization;Surface resistance;Surface topography;Timing;Wires","chemical mechanical polishing;copper;electroplating;integrated circuit yield;manufacturing processes;planarisation;surface topography","CMP process;Cu;ECP model;copper damascene process;improved chip surface uniformity;metal filling algorithm;model based layout pattern;physical mechanisms","","10","","11","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing passive truncated balanced realization (TBR) methods where numerically expensive Lur'e or algebraic Riccati (ARE's) equations are solved, the new method performs balanced truncation on linear system in descriptor form by solving generalized Lyapunov equations. Passivity preservation is achieved by congruence transformation instead of simple truncations. For the first time, passive model order reduction is achieved by combining Lyapunov equation based TBR method with congruence transformation. Compared with existing passive TBR, the new technique has the same accuracy and is numerically reliable, less expensive. In addition to passivity-preserving, it can be easily extended to preserve structure information inherent to RLC circuits, like block structure, reciprocity and sparsity. PriTBR can be applied as a second MOR stage combined with Krylov-subspace methods to generate a nearly optimal reduced model from a large scale interconnect circuit while passivity, structure, and reciprocity are preserved at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show PriTBR and its structure-preserving version, SP-PriTBR, are superior to existing passive TBR and Krylov-subspace based moment-matching methods.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196057","descriptor form;model order reduction;passivity;structure;truncated balanced realization (TBR)","Differential algebraic equations;Engineering profession;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Large-scale systems;Linear systems;Matrix converters;RLC circuits;Riccati equations;Very large scale integration","Lyapunov matrix equations;RLC circuits;Riccati equations;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;linear network analysis","Krylov-subspace methods;Lur'e equation;algebraic Riccati equations;balanced truncation;block structure;congruence transformation;descriptor form;generalized Lyapunov equations;large RLC interconnect circuits;large scale interconnect circuit;linear systems;moment-matching methods;passive interconnect macromodeling;passive model order reduction;passivity preservation;projection-based truncated balanced realization method;structure information","","2","","14","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel probability-based algorithm and technique that can rapidly find an MLV. Unlike most traditional techniques that ignore the leakage current overhead of the newborn MLV controller, our technique can take this overhead into account. Ignoring this overhead during solution exploration may bring a side effect that is misrecognizing a non-optimum solution as an optimum one.

Some masters in such systems are required to complete their work for given timing constraints, resulting in the satisfaction of system-level timing constraints. The computation time of each master is predictable, but it is not easy to predict its data transfer time since the communication architecture is mostly shared by several masters. Previous works solved this issue by minimizing the latencies of several latency-critical masters, but the side effect of these methods is that it can increase the latencies of other masters, hence they may violate the given timing constraints. Unlike previous works, our method uses the concept of ""slack"" in order to make the latency as close as its given constraint, resulting in the reduction of the side effect. The proposed arbitration scheme consists of bandwidth-conscious arbiter and scheduler. The arbiter can be any existing bandwidth-conscious arbiter and the scheduler implements the latency-awareness proposed in this paper. The scheduler is involved in the arbitration only when it observes a request whose slack is not sufficient for the given timing constraint. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the conventional round-robin arbiter by more than 100% in the best case in terms of the longest violated cycles.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196025","","Bandwidth;Decoding;Delay;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Real time systems;Throughput;Time division multiple access;Time to market;Timing","embedded systems;system buses;system-on-chip","bandwidth-conscious arbiter;bandwidth-conscious scheduler;data transfer time;latency-critical masters;slack-based bus arbitration scheme;soft real-time constrained embedded systems;timing constraints","","6","","13","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such cases, code is generated to bypass the evaluation of the conditional expression. In instances when the bypass code is faster to evaluate than the conditional expression, a net performance gain is obtained. Our experiments with the Mediabench applications show that the short-circuit transformation yields a an average of 35.1% improvement in execution time for SPARC and an average of 36.3% improvement in execution time for ARM.

While suitable for the reduction of large-scale circuits, those approaches cannot generate reduced models as compact as desired. To achieve smaller models with better error control, a novel technique, SBPOR (Second-order Balanced truncation for Passive Order Reduction), is proposed in this paper, which is the first second-order balanced truncation method proposed for passive reduction of RLC circuits. SBPOR is superior to the pioneering work in the control community because second-order systems can be balanced via congruency transformation without any accuracy loss. In addition, compared with the first-order balanced truncation approaches, SBPOR is a better choice for RLC reduction. SBPOR preserves not only passivity but also the structure information inherent to RLC circuits, which is a special need for RLC reduction. In addition, SBPOR is computationally more efficient as it only needs to solve one linear matrix equation instead of two quadratic matrix equations.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261163","Algorithms;Model order reduction;second-order balanced truncation","Circuit simulation;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Control systems;Equations;Error correction;Large-scale systems;Permission;RLC circuits;Symmetric matrices","RLC circuits","RLC circuits;model order reduction;moment-matching concept;passive order reduction;second-order balanced truncation","","0","","11","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These architectures consist of multiple electronic control units (ECUs) connected with standardized buses. The most common configuration features periodic activation of tasks and messages coupled with run-time priority-based scheduling. The correct deployment of applications on such architectures requires end-to- end latency deadlines to be met. This is challenging since deadlines must be enforced across a set of ECUs and buses, each of which supports multiple functionality. The need for accommodating legacy tasks and messages further complicates the scenario. In this work, we automatically assign task and message periods for distributed automotive systems. This is accomplished by leveraging schedulability analysis within a convex optimization framework to simultaneously assign periods and satisfy end-to-end latency constraints. Our approach is applied to an industrial case study as well as an example taken from the literature and is shown to be both effective and efficient.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261191","Algorithms;Performance;activation period;automotive systems;end-to-end latency","Actuators;Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Delay;Job shop scheduling;Permission;Real time systems;Runtime;Timing","automotive electronics;distributed processing;real-time systems","active-safety automotive applications;convex optimization;distributed architectures;hard real-time distributed automotive systems;multiple electronic control units;period optimization;run-time priority-based scheduling","","7","1","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a unified and complete algorithm for computing test responses in the presence of timing exceptions with both setup and hold violations, and Boolean timing constraints. The new algorithm analyzes all possible effects of glitches in the circuit. It resolves pessimism in the case of multiple interacting timing exception paths. The new method significantly reduces the number of unknowns in the test responses, resulting in improved test coverage and test compression.

We exploit bandwidth very effectively by selecting a suitable clock frequency for each task and maximize performance with partial RTR by exploiting data-parallelism property of common image-processing tasks. Our theoretical principles are integrated in our scheduling strategy, SCHEDRTR. We present detailed application case studies on a cycle-accurate simulation platform that addresses microarchitectural concerns and includes detailed resource considerations of the Virtex XC2V3000 device.

A remarkable difference with general multiprocessor task scheduling is that NPs are often programmed into a hybrid parallel and pipeline topology. In this paper, we introduce a multilevel balancing and refining algorithm for NP program mapping. We use a divide- and-conquer approach to recursively bipartition the task graph into disjoint subdomains. At each level of bipartition, the processing resources will be co-allocated so that an estimation of throughput can be derived. The bipartition continues until the code of the tasks can be fit into the instruction memory of processing elements. Then the algorithm iteratively refines the solution by migrating tasks from the bottleneck stage to other stages. The performance of our scheme is evaluated with a suite of NP benchmarks using SUIF/Machine SUIF compiler and Intel IXA Architecture Tool. The throughput improvement is significant: average throughput is increased by 20%, and the maximum is 108%.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261294","Algorithms;Network Processors;Performance;Program Mapping","Delay;Iterative algorithms;Logic;Network topology;Permission;Pipelines;Processor scheduling;Routing;Throughput;Transcoding","computational complexity;divide and conquer methods;optimisation;pipeline processing;processor scheduling","Intel IXA Architecture Tool;SUIF/Machine SUIF compiler;divide- and-conquer approach;load balanced pipeline;multilevel balancing;network processors;program mapping;recursive bipartitioning;refining algorithm","","0","","16","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems use multiprocessor systems-on-chip of which it must be guaranteed that enough resources are available for each application to meet its throughput constraints. This requires a task binding and scheduling mechanism that provides timing guarantees for each application independent of other applications while taking into account the available processor space, memory and communication bandwidth. Synchronous dataflow graphs (SDFGs) are used to model time-constrained multimedia applications. They allow modeling of cyclic, multi- rate dependencies between tasks. However, existing resource allocation techniques can only deal with acyclic and/or single-rate dependencies. Dependencies in an SDFG can be expressed in single-rate form, but then the problem size may increase exponentially making resource allocation infeasible. This paper presents a new resource allocation strategy which works directly on SDFGs, building on an efficient technique to calculate throughput of a bound and scheduled SDFG. Experimental results show that the strategy is effective in terms of run-time and allocated resources.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261288","Algorithms;Experimentation;Synchronous Data ow;Theory;mapping;multi-processor;throughput","Bandwidth;Decoding;Multimedia systems;Multiprocessing systems;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Runtime;Streaming media;Throughput;Timing","data flow graphs;embedded systems;multimedia systems;resource allocation;system-on-chip","embedded multimedia system;multiple time-constrained application;multiprocessor resource allocation;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;synchronous dataflow graph","","13","","","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach reduces the overall traffic produced to collect the current state of the system (monitoring-traffic), needed for runtime mapping, compared to a centralized mapping scheme. In our experiment, we obtain 10.7 times lower monitoring traffic compared to the centralized mapping scheme proposed in [8] for a 64 times 64 NoC.

We present a new SAT solver that operates on the negation normal form (NNF) of the given Boolean formulas/circuits. The NNF of a formula is usually more succinct than the CNF of the formula in terms of the number of variables. Our algorithm applies the DPLL algorithm to the graph-based representations of NNF formulas.

First an appropriate SMC is designed to have continuous control output and then experimental results for position tracking using DSP and analog application are presented for comparison.","","978-1-4244-1282-2","978-1-4244-1282-2","10.1109/MED.2007.4433872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433872","","Aerospace materials;Atomic force microscopy;Bandwidth;Capacitive sensors;Digital signal processing;Frequency;Hysteresis;Open loop systems;Piezoelectric actuators;Sliding mode control","analogue circuits;piezoelectric actuators;position control;variable structure systems","DSP application;analog sliding mode controller;piezoelectric actuator;position tracking","","0","","16","","","27-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we discuss electro- hydraulic controlling systems of injection molding machine by using a simple Micro controller based embedded system that provides an effective and easy way to control the sequence of the hydraulic actuators movement and the states of hydraulic system. The project of a specific controller for Injection Molding Machine application join the study of automation design and the control processing of Hydraulic systems with the electronic design based on micro controllers to implement the resources of the controller. The micro controller based embedded system and its associated interfacing peripherals with the machine are described. The software including the control and interactive program is written in BASIC language for the sequence control of the machine and the closed-loop control of the injection speed process.","","978-1-4244-1552-6","978-1-4244-1553-3","10.1109/INMIC.2007.4557703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557703","Analog to digital converter (ADC);Basic-X Microcontroller;Close loop system;Digital to analog converter DAC;Embedded system;Hydraulic system;Injection Molding Machine (IMM);Liquid Crystal display (LCD);Solenoid valves","Application software;Automatic control;Control systems;Design automation;Electrical equipment industry;Embedded system;Hydraulic actuators;Hydraulic systems;Injection molding;Relays","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;electrohydraulic control equipment;embedded systems;hydraulic actuators;injection moulding;microcontrollers;peripheral interfaces;relay control","basic language;closed-loop control;electro-hydraulic controlling system;embedded system design;industrial automation application;injection molding machine;interactive software program;micro controller based control system;peripheral interface;relay control panel","","0","","6","","","28-30 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The heterogeneous, decentralized and distributed nature of Grid environment places special requirement for Grid applications management. With a large number of scientists eager to use the Grid, the need of the hour is to provide a means through which the user can exploit the Grid without getting bogged by its complexities for developing, building, executing and debugging their Grid applications. In other words, there arises a need for a common application development interface to compile, build, execute, debug and profile applications on heterogeneous environment like GARUDA Grid. The authors working at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) have developed a Grid application development environment called G-IDE, which abstracts the grid technology diversity. G-IDE helps application developers to compile, build, execute, debug, and profile grid applications on remote resources efficiently. G-IDE helps in rapid development of grid applications by the scientific programming community. In this paper, the authors described details of its features, the design, architecture, and implementation of G-IDE.","","978-0-7695-3064-2","","10.1109/E-SCIENCE.2007.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4426924","","Application software;Automation;Availability;Debugging;Distributed computing;Environmental management;Grid computing;Middleware;Monitoring;Sun","grid computing;natural sciences computing;program compilers;program debugging;programming environments;resource allocation","GARUDA Grid;application building;application compilation;application debugging;application development interface;application execution;geographically distributed resources;grid application management;grid environment;grid technology diversity;heterogeneous environment;integrated development environment;remote resources;scientific programming","","1","","19","","","10-13 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
