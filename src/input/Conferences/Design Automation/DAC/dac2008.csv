SystemCoDesigner offers a fast design space exploration and rapid prototyping of behavioral SystemC models. Together with Forte Design Systems, a fully automated approach was developed by integrating behavioral synthesis into the design flow. Starting from a behavioral SystemC model, hardware accelerators can be generated automatically using Forte Cynthesizer and can be added to the design space. The resulting design space is explored automatically by optimizing several objectives simultaneously using state of the art multi-objective optimization algorithms. As a result, SystemCoDesigner presents optimized hardware/software solutions to the designer who can select any of them for rapid prototyping on an FPGA basis. Thus, SystemCoDesigner bridges the gap from ESL to RTL and increases the confidence in early design decisions.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555883","Design Space Exploration;ESL Design;Rapid Prototyping","Algorithm design and analysis;Bridges;Design automation;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Space exploration","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic design;optimisation","ESL tool;FPGA basis;Forte Cynthesizer;Forte Design Systems;SystemCoDesigner;automatic design space exploration;behavioral SystemC models;behavioral synthesis;design flow;hardware accelerators;multiobjective optimization algorithms;optimized hardware/software solutions;rapid prototyping","","3","1","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New materials and innovative device structures are needed to extend CMOS scaling and integrate disruptive ""More than Moore"" functionality, but these can have adverse impact on manufacturing cost and risk. Hence, tradeoff analysis spanning process, device, circuit, memory, package, architecture, software, and business disciplines is required during the advanced technology development cycle to explore and co-optimize technology and design choices. Such methodology, in conjunction with judicious use of test chips, also provides for a bridge from innovative technology solutions to mainstream product adoption. Several approaches are currently in use for ad-hoc exploration of advanced technology and design - typically based on spreadsheet analysis, guru consultation, and/or full trial designs. With the exploding complexity of the optimization space, subject matter knowledge and expert experience needs to be complemented with a structured methodology and tools. A ""Holistic Pathfinding"" methodology is proposed for addressing technology and design tradeoffs early in the development cycle to allow co-optimization all the way up to the system architecture level. A virtual design flow that allows rapid estimation of performance, power and cost attributes of a potential product, as a function of a given set of process or design assumptions is described as shown. Key target features of such a virtual flow and a summary of the attributes of several candidate point tools is presented. Requirements for the tools and methodologies to be used for Pathfinding across the span of disciplines are outlined, hi order to enable system cost and performance/power analyses, the requirements for predictive models that desc- - ribe variability, leakage, devices, interconnect, and DFM attributes are identified. Examples of Pathfinding application for co-optimization of memory technology and architecture, reduced parametric variability using restricted physical design rules, and exploration of 3D chip stacking are presented to highlight the requirements and gaps in the existing EDA tool solutions. The vision is for a design exploration platform that outputs performance, active and standby power, and cost estimates in reasonable response time, and with physical and variation awareness at the architectural level.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555886","","CMOS technology;Chip scale packaging;Circuits;Computer architecture;Cost function;Manufacturing;Memory architecture;Signal design;Software packages;Space technology","CMOS integrated circuits;electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;system-in-package;system-on-chip;virtual instrumentation","3D chip stacking;CMOS scaling;CMOS technology;EDA tool solutions;Holistic Pathfinding;SOC;SiP;ad-hoc exploration;full trial designs;guru consultation;innovative technology;mainstream product adoption;memory technology;parametric variability;signal integrity;spreadsheet analysis;tradeoff analysis spanning process;virtual design flow;virtual wireless chip design","","0","","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The flexibility provided by the N-variants enables a number of important tasks, including IP protection, IP metering, security, design optimization, self-adaptation and fault-tolerance. The method is based on extending the finite state machine (FSM) of the design to include multiple variants of the same design specification. The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the N-variant method for content protection in portable media players, e.g., iPod.

Lifetime management is typically supervised by the system via battery-aware task scheduling, while safety is managed on the battery side via features deployed into smart batteries. This research proposes IntellBatt; an intelligent battery cell array based novel design of a multi-cell battery that offloads battery lifetime management onto the battery. By deploying a battery cell array management unit, IntellBatt exploits various battery related characteristics such as charge recovery effect, to enhance battery lifetime and ensure safe operation. This is achieved by using real-time cell status information to selects cells to deliver the required load current, without the involvement of a complex task scheduler on the host system. The proposed design was evaluated via simulation using accurate cell models and real experimental traces from a portable DVD player. The use of a multi-cell design enhanced battery lifetime by 22% in terms of battery discharge time.

Nevertheless, we observe that whitespace allocation might worsen the routability of a placement. To remedy this deficiency, we propose in this paper a new direction/technique, called net overlapping removal, to optimize the routability during placement. Unlike most previous works that allocate whitespace among blocks, our approach moves nets apart from congested regions to improve the chip routability. To apply the net overlapping removal technique, we generalize a net bounding-box based congestion evaluation model to handle practical routing constraints and speed up the routability optimization during placement. We further propose a Gaussian smoothing technique to handle the challenging macro porosity issue, arising in modern mixed-size designs with large macros that require to preserve routing resources for inner routing of the macros.

Assigning cores to the different supply voltages and floorplanning to create contiguous voltage islands are the two important steps in the design process. We propose a new application-driven, floorplan-aware approach to voltage partitioning and island creation with the objective of reducing overall SoC power, area and runtime. Previous approaches used the voltage assignment table as the starting point for voltage island creation. In this paper, we present a technique to generate a voltage assignment table using dynamic programming. Next, we partition the cores into islands, based on the Power State Model (PSM) of the application, and connectivity information used in floorplanning. Finally, solutions are sent to the floorplanner in sequence until a valid solution is reached. Compared to previously reported techniques, a 10% reduction in power and 8% reduction in area are achieved using our approach, with an average runtime improvement of 2.3X.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555800","Dynamic Programming;Energy;Floorplan;Voltage Island","Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Logic programming;Process design;Runtime;Simulated annealing;System-on-a-chip;Voltage fluctuations","dynamic programming;integrated circuit layout;system-on-chip","dynamic programming;floorplan-aware voltage island design;power state model;system-on-chip designs;voltage island technique","","4","","18","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CCTS is done by merging all the clock trees belonging to different IPs per chip specifications. A primary requirement of CCTS is to balance the sub-clock-trees belonging to different IPs such that the entire tree has a small skew across all process corners. This helps in timing closure across all the design corners. Another important requirement of CCTS is to reduce clock divergence between IPs that have critical timing paths between them, thereby reducing maximum possible clock skew in the critical paths and thus improves yield. In this work, we propose effective CCTS algorithms to simultaneously reduce multi-corner skew and clock divergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to solve this practically important problem. Experimental results on several testcases indicate that our methods achieve 10%-31%(20% on average) clock divergence reduction and between 16-64ps skew reduction (1.6%-6.4% of cycle time for a 1 GHz clock) with less than 0.5% increase in buffer area/wirelength compared to existing CTS algorithms.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555913","Chip-level CTS;Clock Network;Physical Design","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Delay;Merging;Registers;Robustness;System-on-a-chip;Testing;Timing;Very large scale integration","clocks;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","frequency 1 GHz;integrated circuits;robust chip-level clock tree synthesis;system-on-a-chip designs","","0","","7","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Determining the soft error rate (SER) of a combinational circuit involves three main masking mechanisms: logic, timing and electrical. Most previous papers focus on logic and electrical masking. Here, we develop static and statistical analysis techniques to estimate timing masking through the error-latching window of each gate. Our SER analysis algorithms incorporating timing masking are 10 - 100x faster than comparable evaluators and can be used in synthesis and layout. We show that 62% of gates identified as error-critical using timing masking would not be identifiable by considering only logic masking. Furthermore, hardening the top 10% of error-critical gates leads to a 43% reduction in the SER. We also propose to decrease the error-latching window of each gate by relocating it such that path lengths to primary outputs are equalized. Our results show that this technique yields 14% improvement in SER with no area overhead.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555952","SEUs;Soft Errors;Timing","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Delay;Fault tolerance;Integrated circuit reliability;Logic circuits;Logic design;Robustness;Timing","circuit reliability;logic circuits;timing circuits","error-latching window;logic circuit design;reliability;soft error rate;timing masking","","2","","22","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a hardware/software methodology ""SHIELD"" to detect code injection attacks in MPSoCs. SHIELD instruments the software programs running on application processors in the MPSoC and also extracts control flow and basic block execution time information for runtime checking. We employ a dedicated security processor (monitor processor) to supervise the application processors on the MPSoC. Custom hardware is designed and used in the monitor and application processors. The monitor processor uses the custom hardware to rapidly analyze information communicated to it from the application processors at runtime. We have implemented SHIELD on a commercial extensible processor (Xtensa LX2) and tested it on a multiprocessor JPEG encoder program. In addition to code injection attacks, the system is also able to detect 83% of bit flips errors in the control flow instructions. The experiments show that SHIELD produces systems with runtime which is at least 9 times faster than the previous solution. SHIELD incurs a runtime (clock cycles) performance overhead of only 6.6% and an area overhead of 26.9%, when compared to a non-secure system.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555939","Architecture;Bit Flips;Code Injection;Multiprocessors;Tensilica","Application software;Data mining;Design methodology;Embedded system;Hardware;Information analysis;Information security;Instruments;Monitoring;Runtime","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit reliability;system-on-chip","MPSoC reliability;MPSoC security;SHIELD instruments;Xtensa LX2;application processors;code injection attacks;embedded systems;hardware-software design;monitor processor;multiprocessor JPEG encoder;multiprocessor system on chips;software programs","","1","","20","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an analytical model for SEU induced transients in combinational circuits. The pulse width of the voltage glitch due to an SEU event is a good measure of SEU robustness and our model efficiently computes it for any combinational gate. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is very accurate with a very low pulse width estimation error of 4% compared to SPICE. Our model gains its accuracy by using a non-linear transistor current model, and by considering the effect of tau<sub>B</sub> of the radiation induced current pulse. Our analytical model is very fast and accurate, and can therefore be easily incorporated in a design flow to implement SEU tolerant circuits.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555951","Analysis;Model;Single Event Upset (SEU)","Analytical models;Frequency;Pulse measurements;Resilience;Sequential circuits;Single event transient;Single event upset;Space vector pulse width modulation;Transient analysis;Voltage","SPICE;combinational circuits;sequential circuits","SEU induced transients;SEU-induced pulse width;SPICE;circuit resilience;combinational circuits;nonlinear transistor current model;pulse width estimation error;sequential circuits;single event upsets","","1","","19","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the foundation of scenario-based design lies the ability to identify scenarios, or recurring modes of operation with similar run time characteristics. There are two opposite ends to scenario identification. Some researchers have proposed techniques that, based on domain knowledge, identify hardware-independent scenarios in a media input stream. At the other end, other researchers have proposed techniques that identify hardware-dependent scenarios in a (semi-) automated way. This paper proposes a scenario identification approach that bridges both opposite ends, and finds hardware-independent scenarios in an automated way. It does so by computing execution profiles on a per-frame basis that capture the application's code execution patterns. We find that edge vectors (EVs) are more accurate than basic block vectors (BBVs) at capturing the variation in frame-level decode complexity. The complexity of the proposed automated scenario identification is comparable to existing hardware-dependent scenario identification approaches, yet the scenarios can be used across hardware implementations.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555957","DVFS;Scenario-based design;Video-decoding","Bridge circuits;Decoding;Design methodology;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Hardware;Permission;Streaming media;Time varying systems","decoding;electronic design automation;identification","automated scenario identification;block vectors;code execution patterns;edge vectors;frame-level decode complexity;hardware-independent scenario identification","","0","","20","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A second contribution of our paper is a robust and scalable approach to extract stability conditions for clock gating.

Due to clock gating, the clock tree may include different types of logic gates, e.g., AND gates, OR gates, and buffer gates. If the logic gates at the same level are in different types, which have different timing behaviors, the control of clock skew becomes difficult. Based on that observation, in this paper, we present a novel clock tree design style, called type-matching clock tree, to ensure that the logic gates at the same level are in the same type. We prove that any clock control logic can always be transformed to our type-matching clock tree. Then, based on the idea of type-matching clock tree, we propose a zero skew gated clock tree synthesis algorithm.

Inserting a large number of buffers may cause not only dramatic cell migration but also routing hotspots. If buffering is not controlled well, it may fail to close a design. Placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness can allocate space for inserting these buffers, and buffering with congestion awareness can improve the routability. Therefore, there is essential need for a placement framework with explicit porosity and congestion control. In this paper, we propose the first integrated nonlinear placement framework with porosity and congestion aware buffer planning. We demonstrate the integration of increasingly refined cell porosity and routing congestion aware buffer planning and insertion methodology in a high quality nonlinear placer.

IFRA consists of special design and analysis techniques required to bridge a major gap between system-level and circuit-level debug. Special hardware recorders, called footprint recording structures (FRS's), record semantic information about data and control flows of instructions passing through various design blocks of a processor. This information is recorded concurrently during normal operation of a processor in a post-silicon system validation setup. Upon detection of a problem, the recorded information is scanned out and analyzed for bug localization. Special program analysis techniques, together with the binary of the application executed during post-silicon validation, are used for the analysis. IFRA does not require full system-level reproduction of bugs or system-level simulation. Simulation results on a complex super-scalar processor demonstrate that IFRA is effective in accurately localizing bugs with very little impact on overall chip area.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555846","Validation;debug;design for debug;verification","Analytical models;Bridge circuits;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Computer bugs;Costs;Fault detection;Hardware;Information analysis;Reproducibility of results","program debugging;program verification","circuit-level debug;instruction footprint recording and analysis;post-silicon bug localization;post-silicon system validation setup;post-silicon validation;program analysis techniques;semantic information;system-level debug","","8","44","27","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new approach that exploits formal verification of conditional coverage points with the goal of early identification of hard-to-verify logic. We use the difficulty of formal verification problems as an early estimator of the verification complexity of a design. While traditional verification methods consider conditional coverage only in the design verification phase, we describe an approach that uses conditional coverage at a much earlier stage-the design phase, during which changes to the RTL code are still possible.

Many manufacturers now offer a range of package level integration solutions from traditional planar approaches to commonly used die stacking and recently introduced die level 3-D integration. With the introduction of 3-D integration, designers and system integrators can now consider physical design optimizations which include functional stacking, through silicon interconnect to reduce power and signal latency, and optimized manufacturing cost. To enable design teams to take advantage of the benefits available with this technology, new capabilities must be developed to support the design and implementation process. This support must start at the architectural level where issues of robustness, reliability, testability and power must be thoroughly studied. Support must continue through to manufacturing, packaging, and final test development. In this presentation we will explore how existing design technology and methods can be practically evolved to support the powerful scaling capabilities inherent in 3-D integration technology.

Methodological consistency requires that a similar number of parameters be taken into account during layout parasitic extraction. Because of the inherent variability of these parameters, the issue of efficiently extracting deterministic parasitic sensitivities with respect to such a large number of parameters must be addressed. In this paper, we tackle this very issue in the context of capacitance sensitivity extraction. In particular, we show how the adjoint sensitivity method can be efficiently integrated within a finite-difference (FD) scheme to compute the sensitivity of the capacitance with respect to a large set of BEOL parameters. If n<sub>p</sub> is the number of parameters, the speedup of the adjoint method is shown to be a factor of n<sub>p</sub>/2 with respect to direct FD sensitivity techniques. The proposed method has been implemented and verified on a 65 nm BEOL cross section having 10 metal layers and a total number of 59 parameters. Because of its speed, the method can be advantageously used to prune out of the CAD flow those BEOL parameters that yield a capacitance sensitivity less than a given threshold.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555949","Sensitivity analysis;adjoint method;capacitance extraction","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Design automation;Design methodology;Monte Carlo methods;Parasitic capacitance;Process design;Prototypes;System-on-a-chip;Wiring","CAD;capacitance;design for manufacture","BEOL cross section;BEOL parameters;CAD methodology;design-for-manufacturability;finite-difference scheme;layout parameters;layout parasitic extraction;on-chip capacitance sensitivities;process parameters;size 65 nm","","0","3","10","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel compositional algorithm to verify sequential equivalence of large designs that are not only retimed but also optimized sequentially and combinationally. With a new notion of conditional equivalence in the presence of retiming, the proposed compositional algorithm performs hierarchical verification by checking whether each sub-block is conditionally equivalent, then checking whether the conditions are justified on their parent block by temporal equivalence. This is the first compositional algorithm handling both retiming and sequential optimizations hierarchically.

If our goal is to select a subset of tests from a set of tests, using these coverage metrics require simulation of the entire set before the effectiveness of tests can be compared. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that estimates the input space covered by a set of tests. We use unsupervised support vector analysis to learn such a space, resulting in a subset of tests that represent the original set of tests. A direct application of this methodology is to select tests before simulation in order to reduce simulation cycles. Consequently, simulation effectiveness can be improved.

Therefore, there is a need for custom FPUs for embedded systems. The creation of a custom FPU requires the selection of a subset of the full floating-point instruction set and the implementation of this subset in hardware, such that the runtime of the application is minimized. To minimize area, it is desirable to merge the datapaths for each of the floating-point operations, so that redundant hardware is minimized. Floating-point datapaths are complex and contain components with varying bit-widths, so sharing components of different bit-widths is necessary. However, this introduces the problem of bit-alignment, which involves determining how smaller resources should be aligned within larger resources when merged. This is a problem that has been largely neglected in previous work. Thus, this paper presents a novel algorithm for solving the bit-alignment problem, which neatly integrates into the datapath merging process. By solving this bit-alignment problem, automatic datapath merging can be made available for FPU generation. To explore the trade-offs between area and performance, a rapid design space exploration was performed to determine which FP operations should be implemented in hardware rather than emulated.

Our approach is based on bottom-up refinement/trimming techniques that optimize a given datapath irrespective of whether it was designed manually or generated automatically. The optimizations can also preserve parts of the netlist specified by the designers, and hence, allow reuse of design efforts and can lead to predictable convergence. In this paper, we show that trimming unused and underutilized resources of typical general-purpose datapaths can lead to 30-40% average energy savings, without any performance loss. However, general-purpose architectures often compromise parallelism to make the design implementable. With our trimming approach, we can afford to have a base architecture that is not intended for implementation and has more parallelism, and then apply refinement to make it implementable. For our benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.8 times (avg. 25%) and 2.6 times (avg. 40%) performance improvement, compared to two general-purpose architectures (i.e. a 4- issue VLIW and a DLX), respectively.

In this paper, we first give a case study to show the needs of integrating these constraints in a hierarchical manner. Then, we present the first formulation for analog placement based on hierarchical module clustering. Our approach can handle analog placement with various constraint groups including matching, (hierarchical) symmetry, and (hierarchical) proximity groups.

This is to reduce the simultaneous switching noise (SSN), generated due to the switching activity of digital drivers. Typically this reduction in impedance is accomplished by placing decoupling capacitors between the power and ground planes of a package or board. However, the performance of the decoupling solution is a function of capacitor selection and its placement. In this paper, an automatic capacitor placement optimization method has been proposed. This method relies on a genetic algorithm to provide a stochastic search of the design space, while employing an efficient core PDN simulator based on the multi-layer finite difference method (M-FDM).

Timing tools attempt to model and predict the delay of all the paths on a chip, which may be in the millions. These delay predictions often have a significant error and when silicon is measured there is a large variation of path delays as compared to the prediction of the tools. This variation may be caused by process, environmental or other effects that are often unpredictable. It is therefore desirable to use early silicon data to better predict and model potential speedpaths for subsequent silicon steppings. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning-based approach that uses a small number of identified speedpaths to predict a larger set of potential speedpaths, thus significantly enhancing the traditional timing prediction flows post-silicon.

However, complicated power network due to the use of nMOS and pMOS switches in zigzag fashion has limited its application to custom circuits. Heterogeneous use of power rails inevitably incurs overhead of area and wirelength during physical design. Furthermore, the use of sleep vector causes additional switching power when entering standby mode and returning back to active mode. The switching power should be minimized not to outweigh the leakage saving by employing ZPG scheme. In this paper, we propose a complete power network architecture, which allows us to use unmodified standard cell elements for implementing ZPG circuits. We formulate selecting sleep vector as a multi- objective optimization problem, minimizing transition energy and total wirelength. We solve the problem by employing multiobjective genetic-based algorithm. Experimental results show the saving of 39% in transition energy and 8% in wirelength, on average, for several benchmark circuits in 65-nm technology.

Voltage waveform shapes are increasingly more difficult to represent as simple ramps due to highly resistive interconnects and Miller cap effects at receiver gates. Propagation of complex voltage waveforms, and accurate modeling of nonlinear driver and receiver effects in crosstalk noise analysis require accurate cell models. A good cell model should be independent of input waveform and output load, should be easy to characterize and should not increase the complexity of a cell library with high-dimensional look-up tables. At the same time, it should provide high accuracy compared to SPICE for all analysis scenarios including multiple-input switching, and for all cell types and cell arcs, including those with high stacks. It should also be easily extendable for use in statistical STA and noise analysis, and one should be able to simulate it fast enough for practical use in multi-million gate designs. In this paper, we present a gate model built from fast transistor models (FXM) that has all the desired properties.

There are two embodiments in WavePipe: backward and forward pipelining schemes. While the former creates independent computing tasks that contribute to a larger future time step by moving backwards in time, the latter performs predictive computing along the forward direction of the time axis. Unlike existing relaxation methods, WavePipe facilitates parallel circuit simulation without jeopardying convergence and accuracy.

A preferred decomposition is disjoint, i.e. X<sub>C</sub> = Oslash, and balanced, i.e. |X<sub>A</sub>| ap |X<sub>B</sub>|. Finding such a good decomposition reduces communication and circuit complexity, and yields simple physical design solutions. Prior BDD-based methods may not be scalable to decompose large functions due to the memory explosion problem. Also as decomposability is checked under a fixed variable partition, searching a good or feasible partition may run through costly enumeration that requires separate and independent decomposability checkings.

Thus, circuit-wise buffering is necessary to reduce buffer cost. Recently, some circuit-wise buffering algorithms are proposed. However, these algorithms are based on heuristics which are not scalable in handling large circuits. In this paper, we present a scalable circuit-wise algorithm with three novel features. (1) A linear modeling of nonlinear delay versus cost tradeoff. Due to the similar nature of buffer insertion and gate sizing, gate sizing is handled in such a manner. (2) A dynamic critical sink selection procedure to solve multiple-sink net. Multiple-sink nets have been problems for previous circuit-wise buffering algorithms. (3) A circuit partition technique to divide the circuit into sub-circuits and apply divide-and-conquer scheme. This technique provides high scalability for the algorithm. Experiments on ISCAS85 circuits show that the new algorithm achieves 17X speedup compared with Sze's path based algorithm. In the meantime, it saves 16.0% buffer cost and 4.9% gate cost without increasing circuit delay. Furthermore, the running time of a testcase in ITC99 with approximate one hundred thousand gates is less than 11 minutes, which demonstrates the scalability of the new algorithm.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555911","Buffer Insertion;Gate Sizing;Interconnect Synthesis","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit synthesis;Lagrangian functions;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Scalability;Timing","buffer circuits;delay circuits;divide and conquer methods;scaling circuits","ISCAS85 circuits;circuit delay;circuit partition;circuit-wise buffer insertion;divide-and-conquer scheme;gate sizing;heuristic algorithms;linear modeling;multiple sink nets;nonlinear delay;scalability;scalable circuit-wise algorithm;van Ginneken algorithm","","0","","14","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applied to random variations, the approach is competitive with existing statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) techniques, in that it allows for nonlinear delay models and arbitrary distributions. Applied to uncertain variations, the method is competitive with existing multi-corner STA techniques, in that it more reliably reproduces overall circuit sensitivity to variations. Crucially, this technique can also be applied to the mixed case where both random and uncertain variations are considered.

Considering the OPC effects during routing can significantly alleviate the cost of post-layout OPC operations. In this paper, we present an efficient, accurate, and economical analytical formula for intensity computation and develop the first modeling of post-layout OPC based on a quasi- inverse lithography technique. Extensive simulations with SPLAT, the golden lithography simulator in academia and industry, show that our intensity formula has high fidelity. Incorporating the OPC costs computed by the quasi-inverse lithography technique for our post-layout OPC modeling into a router, the router can be guided to maximize the effects of the correction. Compared with a rule- based OPC method, the experimental results show that our approach can achieve 14% and 16% reductions in the maximum and average layout distortions, respectively.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555870","DFM;Lithography;OPC;RET;Routing","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Costs;Integrated circuit layout;Lithography;Manufacturing industries;Optical distortion;Permission;Routing;Wire","nanolithography;optimisation;proximity effect (lithography);semiconductor process modelling","OPC-effect optimization;SPLAT simulations;intensity modeling;lithography applications;lithography routing;optical proximity correction;post-layout OPC modeling;quasiinverse lithography technique","","5","","17","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DeFer generates a non-slicing floorplan by compacting a slicing floorplan. To find a good slicing floorplan, instead of searching through numerous slicing trees by simulated annealing as in traditional approaches, DeFer considers only one single slicing tree. However, we generalize the notion of slicing tree based on the principle of deferred decision making (DDM). When two subfloorplans are combined at each node of the generalized slicing tree, DeFer does not specify their orientations, the left-right/top-bottom order between them, and the slice line direction. DeFer even does not specify the slicing tree structures for small subfloorplans. In other words, we are deferring the decisions on these factors, which are specified arbitrarily at an early step in traditional approaches. Because of DDM, one slicing tree actually corresponds to a huge number of slicing floorplan solutions, all of which are efficiently kept in one single shape curve. With the final shape curve, it is straightforward to choose a good floorplan fitting into the fixed outline. Several techniques are also proposed to further optimize the wirelength. Experimental results on benchmarks with only hard blocks and with both hard and soft blocks show that DeFer achieves the best success rate, the best wirelength and the best runtime on average compared with other state-of-the-art floorplanners.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555801","Deferred Decision Making;Fixed Outline;Floorplanning","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computational modeling;Decision making;Distributed decision making;Permission;Runtime;Shape;Simulated annealing;Tree data structures","circuit layout;decision making","DeFer;deferred decision making enabled fixed-outline floorplanner;floorplan fitting;nonslicing floorplan;nonstochastic fixed-outline floorplanning algorithm;slicing trees","","0","1","16","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, mounting concerns over noise and uncertainty in signal values motivate a new approach: the design of stochastic logic, that is to say, digital circuitry that processes signals probabilistically, and so can cope with errors and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a general methodology for synthesizing stochastic logic for the computation of polynomial arithmetic functions, a category that is important for applications such as digital signal processing. The method is based on converting polynomials into a particular mathematical form - Bernstein polynomials - and then implementing the computation with stochastic logic. The resulting logic processes serial or parallel streams that are random at the bit level. In the aggregate, the computation becomes accurate, since the results depend only on the precision of the statistics. Experiments show that our method produces circuits that are highly tolerant of errors in the input stream, while the area-delay product of the circuit is comparable to that of deterministic implementations.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555898","Polynomial Arithmetic;Probabilistic Logic;Stochastic Logic","Arithmetic;Circuits;Logic;Polynomials;Robustness;Signal processing;Signal synthesis;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance;Uncertainty","Boolean functions;digital circuits;digital signal processing chips;logic circuits;logic design;network synthesis;polynomials;probability;stochastic processes","Bernstein polynomials;deterministic Boolean computation;digital circuitry;digital signal processing;integrated circuit technology;probability;robust polynomial arithmetic synthesis;stochastic logic design;stochastic logic synthesis","","3","","11","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, these models were of a look-up type, i.e. pre- characterized for practically all the possible environments in which they would be eventually used. The evolution of the VLSI technology towards nanometer sized features made this characterization methodology impractical. Increasingly, the space of all possible environments grew too rich to be fully covered during characterization. In the past decade, the so-called effective capacitance was introduced to provide some analysis capability to gate models, i.e., the ability to evaluate in the presence of RC loads, although characterized with capacitive loads only. In current and future VLSI technologies, such simple extensions no longer provide the required accuracy. Increasingly, models of logic gates must retain elements of the electrical behavior of the circuit in order to provide accurate timing, noise, and power information. This poses a new challenge on the analysis algorithms, now required to handle an enhanced level of detail in modeling without significantly degrading the overall efficiency of the application.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555860","Current Source Model;Effective Capacitance","Capacitance;Circuit noise;Libraries;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Noise level;Space technology;Timing;Very large scale integration;Working environment noise","VLSI;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic design","RC loads;VLSI technology;capacitive loads;electrical behavior;gate modeling;gate models;high level black-box nonphysical logic library models;logic gates;nanometer sized features;noise analysis;noise information;power analysis;power information;timing analysis;timing information","","0","1","13","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, multi-core processors are increasingly popular for their potential performance improvements through on-chip, thread-level parallelism. However, without novel scheduling and simulation techniques that explicitly explore multithreading capability, current design tools gain only minimal performance improvements. In this paper, we present a new multithreaded simulation scheduler, called MSS, to provide simulation runtime speed-up for executing SDF graphs on multi-core processors.

Errors in operation are detected by Razor flip-flops, and recovery is initiated. The architecture efficiently supports detection, rollback, and recovery to provide a highly adaptable and configurable loop accelerator.

In order to dynamically control the speed of each domain in the presence of parameter and workload variations, we propose a robust feedback control methodology. Towards this end, we first develop a state-space model based on the utilization of the inter-domain queues. Then, we identify the theoretical conditions under which the network is controllable. Finally, we synthesize state feedback controllers to cope with workload variations and minimize power consumption. Experimental results demonstrate robustness to parameter variations and more than 40% energy savings by exploiting workload variations through dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) for a hardware MPEG-2 encoder design.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555891","MPSoC;Voltage-frequency island;dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;feedback control;networks-on-chip;parameter variation","Clocks;Communication system control;Energy consumption;Feedback control;Multiprocessing systems;Network synthesis;Network-on-a-chip;Robust control;State feedback;Voltage","adaptive control;clocks;low-power electronics;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;power aware computing;robust control;state feedback","NoC;clock distribution;dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;hardware MPEG-2 encoder design;inter-domain queues;mixed-clock mixed-voltage queues;multiple clock domains;multiple voltage-frequency islands;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;networks-on-chip;parameter variation problems;power consumption;state feedback robust controllers;state-space model;variation-adaptive feedback control","","3","","18","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic ""biochips"" is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable PCB devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics.

In this work, we develop an efficient SPICE simulation method and statistical transistor model that accurately predict threshold variation as a function of dopant fluctuations and gate length change caused by sub-wavelength lithography and gate etching process. By understanding the physical principles of atomistic simulations, we (a) identify the appropriate method to divide a non-uniform gate into slices in order to map those fluctuations into the device model; (b) extract the variation of V<sub>th</sub> from the strong-inversion region instead of the leakage current, benefiting from the linearity of the saturation current with respect to V<sub>th</sub> and (c) propose a compact model of V<sub>th</sub> variation that is scalable with gate size and the amount of dopant and gate length fluctuations. The proposed SPICE simulation method is fully validated against atomistic simulation results. Given the post-lithography gate geometry, this approach correctly models the variation of device output current in all operating regions. Based on the new results, we further project the amount of V<sub>th</sub> variation at advanced technology nodes, to help shed light on the challenges of future robust circuit design.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555948","Atomistic Simulations;Line-Edge Roughness;Non-Rectangular Gate;Predictive Modeling;Random Dopant Fluctuations;SPICE Simulation;Threshold Variation","Analytical models;Circuit analysis computing;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Computational modeling;Fluctuations;Predictive models;SPICE;Semiconductor process modeling;Threshold voltage","SPICE;doping;electric potential;etching;leakage currents;lithography;transistors","SPICE simulation method;atomistic simulations;dopant fluctuations;etching;gate length;leakage current;line-edge roughness;nanoscale transistor;statistical model;sub wavelength lithography;threshold voltage variation","","10","","16","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome both challenges, this paper proposes a statistical diagnosis framework that formulates the diagnosis problem as a regression learning problem. In this diagnosis framework, the objective is to rank a set of features corresponding to the list of potential sources of concern. The rank is based on measured silicon path delay data such that a feature inducing a larger unexpected timing deviation is ranked higher. Experimental results are presented to explain the learning method. Diagnosis effectiveness will be demonstrated through benchmark experiments and on an industrial design.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555843","Delay test;Learning;Statistical diagnosis;Timing","Aggregates;Delay;Histograms;Permission;Predictive models;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device noise;Silicon;Testing;Timing","integrated circuit modelling;random noise;regression analysis;silicon;timing","Si;regression learning;silicon chips;silicon path delay data;statistical diagnosis;statistical random noises;unmodeled systematic timing;very large search space","","1","2","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a new statistical regression (STAR) technique that applies a novel strategy to address this high dimensionality issue. Unlike most traditional response surface modeling techniques that solve model coefficients from over-determined linear equations, STAR determines all unknown coefficients by moment matching. As such, a large number of (e.g., 10<sup>3</sup>~10<sup>5</sup>) model coefficients can be extracted from a small number of (e.g., 10<sup>2</sup>~10<sup>3</sup>) sampling points without over-fitting. In addition, a novel recursive estimator is proposed to accurately and efficiently predict the moment values. The proposed recursive estimator is facilitated by exploiting the interaction between different moment estimators and formulating the moment estimation problem into a special form that can be iteratively solved. Several circuit examples designed in commercial CMOS processes demonstrate that STAR achieves more than 20times runtime speedup compared with the traditional response surface modeling.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555778","Circuits;Process Variations;Response Surface Modeling","CMOS process;Integrated circuit modeling;Manufacturing processes;Predictive models;Random variables;Recursive estimation;Response surface methodology;Semiconductor device modeling;Semiconductor process modeling;Space technology","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit modelling;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;recursive estimation;regression analysis","CMOS processes;analog circuits;high-dimensional modeling;high-dimensional performance variations;mixed-signal circuits;moment estimators;moment matching;recursive estimator;statistical regression;technology scaling","","0","1","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The validity of this assumption, however, is questionable with the ever-decreasing feature size of today's VLSI technology and the ever-increasing circuit operational frequency. In particular, when functional interconnects such as network-on-chip (NoC) are reused as TAMs, even if they have passed manufacturing test beforehand, failures caused by electrical noise such as crosstalk and transient errors may happen during test data transfer and make good chips appear to be defective, thus leading to undesired test yield loss. To address the above problem, in this paper, we propose novel solutions that are able to achieve reliable modular testing even if test data may sometimes get corrupted during transmission with vulnerable TAMs, by designing a new ""jitter-aware"" test wrapper and a new ""jitter-transparent"" ATE interface.

Based on this lower bound, we evaluate the efficiency of various existing DVS algorithms. Furthermore, we modify the LP formulation to construct an online robust sequential linear programming DVS algorithm for real-time multimedia processing. Simulation results from decoding over a wide range of video sequences shows that on average, our online algorithm consumes less than 1% more energy than the optimal lower bound while dropping only 0.1% of all scheduled decoding jobs, while the existing best algorithm consumes roughly 3% more energy at the same miss rate.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555804","Dynamic Voltage Scaling;Multimedia;Power Management","Decoding;Delay;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Linear programming;Real time systems;Robustness;Scheduling algorithm;Voltage control","image sequences;linear programming;multimedia communication;power aware computing;video coding","decoding;dynamic voltage scaling algorithm;minimum energy consumption;multimedia tasks;offline linear programming;online robust sequential linear programming algorithm;real-time multimedia processing;stringent delay deadlines;video sequences","","0","","14","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the efficiency of reduction degrades as the number of ports increases, which remains a long-standing problem. The reason for the degradation is that existing approaches are based on a centralized framework, where each input-output pair is implicitly assumed to be equally interacted and the matrix-valued transfer function has to be assumed to be fully populated. In this paper, a decentralized model order reduction scheme is proposed, where a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is decoupled into a number of subsystems and each subsystem corresponds to one output and several dominant inputs. The decoupling process is based on the relative gain array (RGA), which measures the degree of interaction of each input-output pair. Our experimental results on a number of interconnect circuits show that most of the input- output interactions are usually insignificant, which can lead to extremely compact models even for systems with massive ports. The reduction scheme is very amenable for parallel computing as each decoupled subsystem can be reduced independently.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555852","Model order reduction;decentralized;multi-port networks","Computational modeling;Control systems;Degradation;Gain measurement;Integrated circuit interconnections;MIMO;Permission;RLC circuits;Signal processing;Transfer functions","MIMO systems;integrated circuit interconnections;linear network analysis;reduced order systems;transfer function matrices","DeMOR technique;MIMO system;decentralized model order reduction technique;decoupling process;input-output interactions;linear networks;massive ports;matrix-valued transfer function;multi-input multi-output system;parallel computing;relative gain array","","2","","16","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fault simulation is inherently parallelizable, and the large number of threads that can be computed in parallel on a GPU results in a natural fit for the problem of fault simulation. Our implementation fault- simulates all the gates in a particular level of a circuit, including good and faulty circuit simulations, for all patterns, in parallel. Since GPUs have an extremely large memory bandwidth, we implement each of our fault simulation threads (which execute in parallel with no data dependencies) using memory lookup. Fault injection is also done along with gate evaluation, with each thread using a different fault injection mask. All threads compute identical instructions, but on different data, as required by the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) programming semantics of the GPU. Our results, implemented on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8800 GPU card, indicate that our approach is on average 35 x faster when compared to a commercial fault simulation engine. With the recently announced Tesla GPU servers housing up to eight GPUs, our approach would be potentially 238 times faster.

Overly pessimistic worst-case execution time analysis techniques borrowed from hard real-time systems domain are not particularly suitable in this context. Instead, the execution time distribution of a task provides a more valuable input to the system-level performance analysis frameworks. Both program inputs and underlying architecture contribute to the execution time variation of a task. But existing probabilistic execution time analysis approaches mostly ignore architectural modeling. In this paper, we take the first step towards remedying this situation through instruction cache modeling. We introduce the notion of probabilistic cache states to model the evolution of cache content during program execution over multiple inputs. In particular, we estimate the mean and variance of execution time of a program across inputs in the presence of instruction cache. The experimental evaluation confirms the scalability and accuracy of our probabilistic cache modeling approach.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555831","Cache Modeling;Probabilistic Execution Time Analysis","Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Consumer electronics;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Performance analysis;Permission;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Timing","cache storage;consumer electronics;multimedia computing;probability","architectural modeling;cache modeling;execution time distribution;multimedia-dominated consumer electronics devices;probabilistic execution time analysis;system-level performance analysis","","0","","19","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, a new type of carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNFET) based on tunneling principle has been proposed, which shows impressive device properties and overcomes some of the limitations of previously proposed CNFET devices. Although carbon nanotube based devices have been optimized for DC performance so far, little has been done to optimize them for high-frequency operation. In this paper, we present, detailed modeling and analysis of device geometry based intrinsic and parasitic capacitances of tunneling carbon nanotube field effect transistors (T-CNFETs) with both single nanotube as well as nanotube-array based channel. Based on the model, we analyze scaling of parasitic capacitances with device geometry for two different scaling scenarios of T-CNFETs. We show that in order to reduce the impact of parasitic capacitance, nanotube density has to be optimized. Furthermore, for the first time, we analyze various factors affecting the high-frequency/RF performance of back gated T-CNFETs and study the impact of parasitic and screening effects on the high-frequency/RF performance of these devices.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555818","Carbon nanotube FET (CNFET);RF performance;modeling","CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;FETs;Geometry;Nanoscale devices;Parasitic capacitance;Performance analysis;Radio frequency;Solid modeling;Tunneling","capacitance;carbon nanotubes;field effect transistors;tunnelling","C;FET;carbon nanotube field effect transistor;high-frequency operation;nanotube-array based channel;parasitic capacitances;screening effects;tunneling","","1","","19","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is necessary to accurately model the impact of crosstalk noise on the circuit delay. Process variations cause variability in the crosstalk alignment which leads to the variability in the delay noise. However, most of the existing approaches model delay noise as a worst-case deterministic quantity. In this work, we capture the variability of delay noise by first deriving the closed-form expressions of mean and standard deviation of the delay noise distribution. Next, we obtain the correlation information of the delay noise and use it to represent the delay noise distribution in canonical form. Delay noise, in canonical form, can easily be integrated with existing SSTA tools.

Open defects are known to be prevalent in the current VLSI technologies and vias are known to be the primary sites of interconnect opens. The voltage on a circuit node that is disconnected due to an open via is determined by several circuit parameters. As the feature size of VLSI circuits decreases, precise knowledge of the values of circuit parameters may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. Thus, it is important to develop methods to generate tests to detect opens that do not require accurate knowledge of circuit parameters. We propose new classes of tests to detect via opens with voltage based (logic) tests that are effective even with imprecise knowledge of circuit parameters. The proposed tests to detect an open via are constituted as a pair of constrained stuck-at fault tests for the circuit node affected by the open defect. One class of proposed tests called circuit parameter independent tests detect via opens even in the case of complete lack of knowledge of the circuit parameters.

The proposed compiler approach has four major steps: task scheduling, processor mapping, data mapping, and packet routing. In the first step, the application code is parallelized and the resulting parallel threads are assigned to virtual processors. The second step implements a virtual processor-to-physical processor mapping. The goal of this mapping is to ensure that the threads that are expected to communicate frequently with each other are assigned to neighboring processors as much as possible. In the third step, data elements are mapped to memories attached to CMP nodes. The main objective of this mapping is to place a given data item into a node which is close to the nodes that access it. The last step of our approach determines the paths (between memories and processors) for data to travel in an energy efficient manner. In this paper, we describe the compiler algorithms we implemented in detail and present an experimental evaluation of the framework. In our evaluation, we test our entire framework as well as the impact of omitting some of its steps.

The register file has been previously shown to exhibit the highest temperature compared to all other hardware components in a modern high- end embedded processor, which makes it particularly susceptible to faults and elevated leakage power. We show that this is mostly due to the highly clustered register file accesses where a set of few registers physically placed close to each other are accessed with very high frequency.

The methodology integrates compiler, operating system, and hardware support to achieve a bandwidth efficient, snoop- free, and coherence cache miss-free shared memory communication between synchronized producer and consumers cores. A compiler- driven code transformation is introduced that utilizes a simple ISA support in the form of a special write-through store instruction. It ensures that producer writes are propagated to the consumers with a single bus transaction per cache block when the producer performs the last write to that cache line before exiting its synchronization region. Information regarding the shared buffers involved in the communications is captured by the OS and provided to the cores with the purpose of filtering bus traffic and performing remote updates when necessary. The end result of the proposed methodology is a single bus transaction per shared cache block and snoop-free communication between a producer and a set of consumers with no intervening coherence misses on the consumer caches. Our experiments demonstrate the significant reductions in both bus traffic and cache misses for a set of multiprocessor benchmarks.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555922","Embedded Multiprocessor;Snoop Protocol","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Delay;Educational institutions;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Instruction sets;Operating systems;Protocols","buffer circuits;cache storage;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers);program compilers;synchronisation;system buses","bandwidth efficient inter-core communication;bus traffic filtering;coherence cache miss-free shared memory communication;compiler;compiler- driven code transformation;cross-layer customization methodology;operating system;shared cache block;single bus transaction per cache block;snoop-free communication;synchronization region;write-through store instruction","","0","","10","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Timing slack is ""stolen"" from fast combinational blocks to be used by slower blocks to meet a more stringent clock cycle time.

In this paper, we present the first approach to the best of our knowledge for integrating clock skew scheduling, threshold voltage assignment, and gate sizing into one optimization formulation. Over 29 circuits in the ISCAS89 benchmark suite, this integrated approach can reduce leakage power by as much as 55.83% and by 18.79% on average, compared to using combinational circuit based power optimization on each combinational block without considering clock skews. Using a 65 nm dual Vth technology library, this corresponds to a 23.87% peak reduction (6.15% on average) in total power at the ambient operating temperature. The average total power reduction further increases to 9.83% if the high temperature library of the same process technology is used.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555890","Clock skew scheduling;Dual-Vth;Gate sizing;Leakage power optimization","Circuit optimization;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Flip-flops;Integrated circuit technology;Libraries;Sequential circuits;Temperature;Threshold voltage;Timing","clocks;logic gates;optimisation;scheduling;sequential circuits","ISCAS89 benchmark suite;Vth technology library;gate sizing;leakage power reduction;leakage power-aware clock skew scheduling;optimization formulation;sequential circuit;threshold voltage assignment;timing slack","","1","","10","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Higher temperature increases current leakage and causes poor reliability. In this paper, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Thermal Management (PDTM) based on Application-based Thermal Model (ABTM) and Core-based Thermal Model (CBTM) in the multicore systems. ABTM predicts future temperature based on the application specific thermal behavior, while CBTM estimates core temperature pattern by steady state temperature and workload. The accuracy of our prediction model is 1.6% error in average compared to the model in HybDTM, which has at most 5% error. Based on predicted temperature from ABTM and CBTM, the proposed PDTM can maintain the system temperature below a desired level by moving the running application from the possible overheated core to the future coolest core (migration) and reducing the processor resources (priority scheduling) within multicore systems. PDTM enables the exploration of the tradeoff between throughput and fairness in temperature-constrained multicore systems. We implement PDTM on Intel's Quad-Core system with a specific device driver to access Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS). Compared against Linux standard scheduler, PDTM can decrease average temperature about 10%, and peak temperature by 5degC with negligible impact of performance under 1%, while running single SPEC2006 benchmark. Moreover, our PDTM outperforms HRTM in reducing average temperature by about 7% and peak temperature by about 3degC with performance overhead by 0.15% when running single benchmark.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555916","Dynamic Thermal Management;Operating System;Temperature","Multicore processing;Power system management;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Predictive models;Processor scheduling;State estimation;Steady-state;Temperature sensors;Thermal management","Linux;integrated circuit modelling;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling;temperature sensors;thermal management (packaging)","Intel Quad-Core system;Linux standard scheduler;SPEC2006 benchmark;application-based thermal model;core-based thermal model;digital thermal sensor;multicore systems;on-chip temperature;predictive dynamic thermal management;priority scheduling;processor power density;steady state temperature","","12","","15","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The min-area retiming problem seeks a solution with the minimum flip-flop area (or number) under a given clock period. Even though having polynomial runtime, the best existing algorithms for this problem still need to first construct a dense path graph and then find a min-cost network flow on it, thus incur huge storage and time expenses for large circuits. Recently, provable incremental algorithms have been discovered for min-period retiming, and heuristic incremental algorithms have been proposed for min-area retiming. However, given the complexity of the problem, min-area retiming is still resisting an efficient provable incremental algorithm. In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting an efficient algorithm to solve the min-area retiming problem incrementally and optimally. Contrary to existing approaches, no dense path graph is constructed; only the active timing constraints are dynamically generated in the algorithm. Experimental results show that the total runtime of our algorithm for all the benchmarks is at least 60 x faster than the best existing approach.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555873","Retiming","Circuits;Clocks;Computer science;Delay;Flip-flops;Iterative algorithms;Permission;Polynomials;Runtime;Timing","clocks;flip-flops;optimisation","clock period;dense path graph;flip-flop structural transformation;heuristic incremental algorithm;min-area retiming;polynomial runtime;sequential optimization technique","","0","1","16","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using class libraries with SystemVerilog can take this a step further by enhancing productivity, and enabling better, more efficient reuse between engineers and between projects. The verification methodology manual (VMM) class library was one of the first SystemVerilog class libraries available, and has been widely adopted. The open verification methodology (OVM) class library has just become available, and while it is similar to VMM in many respects, there are also some important differences. This paper describe the process of converting an existing testbench based on VMM class libraries, to one based on OVM class libraries. The VMM testbench selected for the conversion to OVM was developed for the verification of a custom memory controller for a general purpose DSP SOC. The EBIU (external bus interface unit) is complex enough to require a non-trivial testbench, and the large number of system busses makes it an interesting candidate for a randomized SystemVerilog testbench approach.This paper begin by describing the conversion process of the basic testbench components, including transaction classes and bus functional models. The next step is converting the testbench environment, and adding the extra layers of abstraction which are part of the OVM methodology. Finally, the conversion of the actual tests is described, including the configuration phase, and the transaction generation. The paper conclude by summarizing the similarities and differences between the two approaches, and highlight which aspects of the conversion were straight forward, and which aspects required more attention.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555815","OVM;SystemVerilog;Testbenches;VMM","Digital signal processing;Libraries;Productivity;Rivers;System buses;System testing","digital signal processing chips;formal verification;hardware description languages;software libraries;system buses;system-on-chip","DSP SOC;SystemVerilog language;bus functional models;conversion process;custom memory controller verification;external bus interface unit;high-level verification language;open verification methodology class library;system busses;transaction classes;verification methodology manual class library","","0","","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also propose two efficient via-minimization methods, namely congestion relaxation by layer shifting and rip-up and re-assignment, for a dynamic programming-based layer assignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our router achieves performance similar to the first two winning routers in ISPD 2008 Routing Contest in terms of both routability and wire length at a 1.42X and 25.84X faster routing speed.

The nano-scale memristive device has the potential to construct some novel computing systems because of its distinctive characters, such as non-volatility, non-linearity, low-power, and good scalability. These electrical characteristics of memristors are mainly determined by the material characteristic and the fabrication process. For example, process variations may cause the deviation of the actual electrical behavior of memristors from the original design and result in the malfunction of the device. Therefore, it is very important to understand and characterize the impact of process variations on the electrical behaviors of the memristor and its implication to the circuit design. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the geometry variations on the electrical characteristics of the memristor. Two parameters - NARD (Normalized Accumulative Resistance Deviation) and NAARD (Normalized Accumulative Absolute Resistance Deviation), are introduced to measure the fluctuation of the overall internal state (or the resistance) of a memristor under the impact of process variations.

Most state-of-the-art SAT solvers are based on the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm and require the input formula to be in conjunctive normal form (CNF). We present a new SAT solver that operates on the negation normal form (NNF) of the given Boolean formulas/circuits. The NNF of a formula is usually more succinct than the CNF of the formula in terms of the number of variables. Our algorithm applies the DPLL algorithm to the graph-based representations of NNF formulas. We adapt the idea of the two-watched-literal scheme from CNF SAT solvers in order to efficiently carry out Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP), a key task in the DPLL algorithm. We evaluate the new solver on a large collection of Boolean circuit benchmarks obtained from formal verification problems. The new solver outperforms the top solvers of the SAT 2007 competition and SAT-Race 2008 in terms of run time on a large majority of the benchmarks.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227064","Boolean Satisfiability;DPLL;NNF;Verification","Boolean functions;Business continuity;Circuits;Computer science;Data structures;Formal verification;Hardware;Logic testing;Permission;Software tools","Boolean functions;circuit testing;computability;constraint handling;graph theory","Boolean circuit;Boolean constraint propagation;Boolean satisfiability formula checking;Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm;SAT;conjunctive normal form;formal verification;graph-based representation;hardware-software verification tool;negation normal form;nonclausal formula;watched cuts","","2","","21","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
