Recently, a new Monte Carlo and optimization method, named dynamic weighting Monte Carlo [WL97], has been introduced and successfully applied to the traveling salesman problem, neural network training [WL97], and spin-glasses simulation [LW99]. In this paper, we have successfully applied dynamic weighting Monte Carlo algorithm to the constrained floorplan design with consideration of both area and wirelength minimization. Our application scenario is the constrained floorplan design for mixed signal MCMs, where we need to place all the analog modules together in groups so that they can share common power and ground and are separate from those used by the digital modules. Our experiments indicate that the dynamic weighting Monte Carlo algorithm is very effective for constrained floorplan optimization. It outperforms the simulated annealing for a real mixed signal MCM design by 19.5% in wirelength, with slight area improvement. This is the first work adopting the dynamic weighting Monte Carlo optimization method for solving VLSI CAD problems. We believe that this method has applications to many other VLSI CAD optimization problems.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835110","","Algorithm design and analysis;Design automation;Monte Carlo methods;Neural networks;Optimization methods;Signal design;Simulated annealing;Stochastic processes;Traveling salesman problems;Very large scale integration","Monte Carlo methods;VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;multichip modules;simulated annealing;wiring","CAD;VLSI;analog modules;area;constrained floorplan designs;dynamic weighting Monte Carlo method;mixed signal MCM design;mixed signal MCMs;mixed signal application;neural network training;optimization problems;simulated annealing;spin-glasses simulation;stochastic optimization methods;traveling salesman problem;wirelength minimization","","1","2","18","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, recent work has shown that significant power reductions are possible with techniques based on finite state machine (FSM) decomposition. A serious limitation of previously proposed techniques is that they require the state transition graph (STG) of the FSM to be given or extracted from the circuit. Since the size of the STG can be exponential on the number of registers in the circuit, explicit techniques can only be applied to relatively small sequential circuits. In this paper, we present a new approach to perform FSM decomposition by direct manipulation of the circuit. This way, we do not require the STG, either explicit or implicit, thus further avoiding the limitations imposed by the use of BDDs. Therefore, this technique can be applied to circuits with very large STGs. We provide a set of experimental results that show that power consumption can be substantially reduced, in some cases by more than 70%.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835123","","Automata;Boolean functions;Clocks;Data structures;Energy consumption;Frequency;Power dissipation;Registers;Sequential circuits;Switching circuits","CMOS logic circuits;circuit CAD;finite state machines;graph theory;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;low-power electronics;sequential circuits","FSM decomposition;STG;direct circuit manipulation;finite state machine decomposition;low power design;power consumption reduction;sequential logic circuits;state transition graph;switching activity reduction","","1","","17","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method consists of the following two steps. First, we apply our DFT methods to the controller and the data path, respectively. Then, to support at-speed testing, we append a test plan generator which generates a sequence of test control vectors for the modified data path. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce significantly both of test generation time and test application time compared with the full-scan design, though the hardware overhead of our method is slightly larger than that of the full-scan design.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835171","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Design for testability;Design methodology;Hardware;Logic testing;Sequential analysis;Sequential circuits;Very large scale integration","VLSI;design for testability;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing","VLSI;controller;data path;fault efficiency;nonscan design-for-testability;register transfer level design;test plan generator","","8","1","15","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast and accurate power estimation is needed early in the design process, since power reduction methods tend to have greater impact at higher abstraction levels. Unfortunately, current approaches to power estimation which concentrate on register-transfer-level models or lower are quite slow. Higher-level approaches, while faster, may suffer from inaccuracy. However the advent of cores enables a hybrid approach, described in this paper yielding both fast and accurate estimates from high-level models. In particular, we use power estimation data obtained from the gate-level for a core's representative input stimuli data (instructions), and we propagate this data to a higher (object-oriented) system-level model, which is parameterizable and executable. Depending on the kind of cores, various parameterizable equation or look-up table based techniques are used, resulting in self-analyzing core models. We have applied our technique to several cores of a digital camera SOC and have achieved simulation speedups of over 1000 with accuracies suitable for making reliable power-related system-level design decisions. Although we focus on power estimation, our approach can be used for estimating other metrics as well, such as performance and size.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835085","","Digital cameras;Energy consumption;Equations;Object oriented modeling;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Process design;System-on-a-chip;Table lookup;Yield estimation","circuit simulation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;logic design;object-oriented methods;power consumption","accurate estimates;core-based system-level power modeling;digital camera SOC;gate-level;high-level models;input stimuli data;look-up table;object-oriented system-level model;parameterizable equation;performance;power consumption;power estimation;power reduction;self-analyzing core models;size;system-on-a-chip design","","4","2","19","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their primary objectives are providing convincible proof of authorship with least degradation of the quality of the intellectual property (IF), and achieving robustness against attacks. These are also well accepted as the most important criteria to evaluate different IPP techniques. The essence of such techniques is to limit the solution space by embedding signatures as constraints. One key issue that should be addressed but has not been discussed is the fairness of the techniques: what is the quality of the solution subspace for different signatures, that is, how large the solution subspace is (uniqueness), and how difficulty it is to get a solution from such subspace (hardness). In this paper we introduce fairness as one of the metrics for good IPP techniques and post the challenge problem. of how to design fair water-marking techniques. We claim that all fair techniques have to be instance-oriented and due to the complexity of the problem itself we propose an approach that utilizes the statistical information of the problem instance. We use the satisfiability (SAT) problem as an example to illustrate how fairness could be achieved. We make the observation that the unfairness of the previous watermarking techniques comes from the global embedding of the signature and propose fair watermarking techniques. We test the uniqueness and hardness on a model with full knowledge of the solution and real life benchmarks as well.

Since the ATPG based alternative wire locating procedure is the center engine for all its applications, speeding up of this process should be very crucial and useful, We observe that the bottleneck of the technique lies in the costly redundancy tests among a large number of candidate alternative wires. In this paper, we develop a so-called implication-tree data structure which stores the implication relationship between nodes with determined logic values, and propose a new ATPG-based alternative-wiring algorithm to speed up the engine. The algorithm, Implication-tree Based Alternative-Wiring (IBAW), differs from other ATPG-based algorithms in terms that it selects the source node of alternative wires from the implication-tree, which makes IBAW able to trim out many unnecessary redundancy checking quite easily without calling for complicated procedures. Hence, it produces a steady speeding up of around 3.6 times faster while maintaining the same rewiring capability of the original RAMBO. Our experimental results show that the overall circuit area optimized by IBAW can be slightly better than that by RAMBO, while the runtime is just one-half of the latter.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835136","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit testing;Design automation;Design optimization;Engines;Flexible printed circuits;Logic circuits;Logic design;Wires;Wiring","VLSI;automatic test pattern generation;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit layout;integrated logic circuits;redundancy;tree data structures","ATPG-based alternative-wiring algorithm;IBAW algorithm;implication-tree data structure;logic synthesis;logic transformation algorithm;redundancy checking reduction;rewiring capability;source node selection","","0","","14","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By these technology evolutions, a system is integrated into a chip, the so-called system-on-a-chip (SOC). In order to bridge the gap between available transistors and design in SOC, higher-level behavioral language and re-use of already designed intellectual property (IP) will become more common. However, these techniques affect test methodologies and failure analysis of SOC. On the other hand, SOCs are implemented as a collection of heterogeneous circuits such as ASICs, DRAMs and analog circuits, so there will be large impact on Design for Testability techniques (DFT) and test cost issues. New test methods involving built-in-self-test (BIST) are required that will allow low-speed, low-cost automatic test equipment (ATE) to test the digital portions of SOCs at high speed. In the aspect of test quality, new fault models will be required to handle crosstalk and new failure modes that will result from multi-level metal structures. The old ""stuck-at"" single fault model is becoming less effective for computing expected test results for complex SOC.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835154","","Analog circuits;Automatic testing;Bridge circuits;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Design for testability;Failure analysis;Intellectual property;System-on-a-chip;Tutorial","VLSI;application specific integrated circuits;built-in self test;crosstalk;design for testability;failure analysis;industrial property;integrated circuit testing","DSM era;SOC testing;automatic test equipment;built-in-self-test;crosstalk;deep sub-micron technology;design for testability techniques;failure analysis;failure modes;heterogeneous circuits;higher-level behavioral language;intellectual property;multi-level metal structures;system-on-a-chip;test cost issues;test methodologies;test methods;test quality","","0","","","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present two sets of results: (i) new techniques for flat FM-based hypergraph partitioning (which is the core of multilevel implementations), and (ii) a new multilevel implementation that offers leading-edge performance. Our new techniques for flat partitioning confirm the conjecture that specialized partitioning heuristics may be able to actively exploit fixed nodes in partitioning instances arising in the driving top-down placement context. Our FM variant is competitive with traditional FM on instances without terminals and considerably superior on instances with fixed nodes (i.e., arising during top-down placement). Our multilevel FM variant avoids several complex heuristics and non-trivial tunings that often lead to complex implementations; it achieves trade-offs between solution quality and run time that are comparable or better than those achieved by hMetis-1.5.3. We attempt to provide algorithm descriptions that are as detailed and unambiguous as possible, to allow replicability and speed improvements in future research.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835182","","Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Design automation;Design optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Runtime;Software algorithms;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;directed graphs;iterative methods;logic partitioning","VLSI CAD physical design;balance constraints;driving top-down placement;fixed nodes;flat hypergraph partitioning;hypergraph bipartitioning;improved algorithms;iterative algorithm;multilevel Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning;multilevel implementation;specialized partitioning heuristics;speed improvements","","33","2","24","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An inherent limitation of the conventional CSA applications is that the applications are confined to the sections of arithmetic circuit that can be directly translated into addition expressions. To overcome this limitation, from the analysis of the structures of arithmetic circuits found in industry, we derive a set of simple, but effective CSA transformation techniques.

Proceedings of the ASP-DAC 2000. Asia and South Pacific","20020806","2000","","","667","672","The multi-way partition problem is very important in various applications. In this paper, we use analytical and experimental results to study the k-way partition problem. We introduce the concept of embedding graph for the the k-way partition problem. Based on this concept, we explain different scenarios of using a bi-partition heuristic to solve the k-way partition problem. If C denote the optimal cut cost for the k-way partition problem and the bi-partition heuristics we use are /spl delta/-approximation heuristics, we prove that the cut cost from the hierarchical approach has an approximate upper bound of /spl delta/C/spl middot/log k while the cut cost from the all-way bi-partition, or flat approach, has an upper bound of /spl delta/Ck. This is contrary to some claims made in the recent literature (and CAD tools designed based on it). Experimental results strongly support our theoretical analysis. Our results show that for large target graph, the hierarchical approach is about 77% better than the single-pass all-way bi-partition approach. The all-way bi-partition approach will perform better in a multipass set-up. However, the hierarchical approach is still on average 7.1% better in quality and 144 times faster than the multi-partition all-way bi-partition approach. The main conclusion of this paper is that, contradictary to what has been suggested in literature, hierarchical bi-partitioning is a more effective multi-way partitioning scheme.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835183","","Cost function;Design automation;Joining processes;Partitioning algorithms;Tiles;Upper bound;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;graph theory;iterative methods;logic partitioning","VLSI design;all-way bipartition approach;bipartition heuristics;delta-approximation heuristics;embedding graph;hierarchical approach;iterative approach;k-way partition problem;large target graph;multi-way partitioning;optimal cut cost","","2","","20","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computing the edge separability for a given edge e=(x, y) in an edge weighted undirected graph G(V, E, s, w) is equivalent to finding the x-y mincut. Then, we show that a simple and efficient algorithm CAPFOREST can be used to provide a good estimation of edge separability for all edges in G without using any network flow computation. Related experiments based on large scale ISPD98 benchmark circuits confirm that exploiting edge separability yields better quality partitioning solution compared to various bottom-up clustering algorithms proposed in the literature including Absorption, Density, Rent Parameter, Ratio Cut, Closeness, and Connectivity method.

Applying the technique of circuit rewiring, the partitioning can be further improved by doing some local logic perturbation along the cut-line to drag the solution out of some local minimal. In this paper, we propose an effective coupling scheme of two powerful rewiring techniques to further improve upon those already selected best partition results produced by other conventional partition tools. The improvement is attributed to the additional capability of exercising a guided circuit perturbation, which was not available in the conventional schemes, The known ATPG-based and the recently proposed graph-based rewiring techniques compose our coupling scheme. The ATPG-based rewiring technique is very flexible; however the graph-based rewiring technique is faster and can couple quite well with the ATPG-based scheme to exploit a much larger room for logic perturbations. Our encouraging experimental results show that these two techniques couple each other quite well for this application without costing much CPU overhead. This scheme is also quite efficient thus should be very useful for large circuits.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835181","","Central Processing Unit;Computational efficiency;Costing;Coupling circuits;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Partitioning algorithms;Pins;Wire","Boolean functions;automatic test pattern generation;circuit layout CAD;directed graphs;logic partitioning;minimisation of switching nets","ATPG-based rewiring technique;Boolean network;RAMBO version;circuit partitioning;coupled logic restructuring techniques;directed acyclic graph;effective coupling scheme;graph partitioning;graph-based rewiring technique;guided circuit perturbation;rewiring techniques","","0","","19","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Placement quality is evaluated in terms of the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) of hyperedges in the original circuit hypergraph provided timing constraints are met. Analytical placers are instrumental in handling non-linear timing models, but have two important drawbacks: (a) corresponding optimization algorithms are typically slower than top-down methods driven by multi-level mincut partitioning, and (b) hyperedges must be represented with net models which imply a mismatch of objective functions, with the alternative of computationally expensive linear programming (LP). By comparing to optimal solutions produced by linear programming, we show that net models lead to solution quality loss. To address this problem, we present the first analytical algorithm that does not require net models and permits a direct inclusion of non-linear delay terms; this allows to avoid expensive linearization of delay terms. Our numerical engine utilizes well-known quadratically convergent Newton-type methods for speed; it produces solutions within 12% of the LP optimum.

In response to a user query, the debugger must be able to retrieve and display the value of a source variable in a manner consistent with what the user expects with respect to the source statement where execution has halted. However, when a behavioral specification has been optimized using transformations, values of variables may either be inaccessible in the run-time state or inconsistent with what the user expects. We address the problem that pertains to the retrieval of source values for the globally optimized behavioral specifications. We describe how transformations affect the retrieval of source values.

While the proposed method requires comparable evaluation time to the previous 2nd order calculation method, it ensures more accurate results than those of 2nd order method. The proposed analytic delay calculation method guarantees allowable error tolerance when compared to the results obtained from the AWE technique or HSPICE and has better performance in evaluation time as well as numerical stability. The first algorithm of the proposed method requires 7 moments for the 3rd order approximation and yields accurate delay time approximation.

In this paper, we provide new performance driven formulation for cell move based top-down multiway partitioning algorithms with consideration of the local and global interconnect delay. In our ""constrained acyclic partitioning"" formulation, cell moves are restricted to maintain acyclicity in partitioning solution to prevent cyclic dependency among cells in different partitions. In our ""relaxed acyclic partitioning"" formulation, acyclic constraints are relaxed to give partitioners capability of minimizing cutsize and delay. Our new acyclic constraint based performance driven multiway partitioning algorithm FLARE obtains (i) 4% to 13% better delay compared to the state-of-the-art cutsize minimization based hMetis at almost no increase in cutsize, and (ii) 84% better cutsize compared to the state-of-the-art delay minimization based PRIME at an expense of 16% increase in delay.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835140","","Art;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Delay estimation;Geometry;Integrated circuit interconnections;Minimization;Partitioning algorithms;Silicon;Very large scale integration","VLSI;delays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;logic CAD;logic partitioning","FLARE;cell move based algorithms;constrained acyclic partitioning;cutsize;global interconnect delay;interconnect-centric design paradigm;local interconnect delay;performance driven multiway partitioning","","7","","18","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three kinds of boundaries (forced boundary, natural boundary and dielectric interface) are treated. Two integral kernels with different singularity (1/r, 1/r/sup 3/) are involved while computing the interaction between the boundary elements. These features make it significantly distinct from the hierarchical algorithm based on the indirect BEM, which only handles single dielectric, one integral kernel and one forced boundary. The coefficient matrix is generated and stored hierarchically in this paper. As a result, computation cost of the matrix is reduced, and the matrix-vector multiplication in the GMRES iteration is accelerated, so computation speed is improved significantly.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835141","","Acceleration;Boundary element methods;Dielectrics;Electric potential;Finite difference methods;Integral equations;Integrated circuit interconnections;Kernel;Parasitic capacitance;Very large scale integration","VLSI;boundary-elements methods;capacitance;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;matrix multiplication","3D VLSI parasitic capacitance;3D interconnect capacitance;Appel's hierarchical algorithm;coefficient matrix;computation cost;dielectric interface;direct boundary element method;electric potential;finite dielectric structure;forced boundary;hierarchical computation;integral kernels;many-body problem;matrix-vector multiplication;multiple dielectrics;natural boundary;normal electric field intensity;singularity","","0","","14","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result of applying them, our chip has been able to work at 400 MHz, and channel usage has not exceeded its capacity and gate overhead for buffer insertions has been only 1.6% of total gates.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835108","","Chip scale packaging;Delay;Feedback loop;High performance computing;Large scale integration;Logic;Microprocessors;Timing;Wires;Wiring","VLSI;buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips;timing;wiring","400 MHz;buffer insertions;channel usage;delay-optimal wiring plan;gate overhead;global assignment;global wires;high performance computing machines;inserted buffers;local congestion;microprocessor;timing issue;wiring channels;wiring resources","","0","","11","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that given any two circuits to be verified, finding the best partitions that minimize the verification runtime is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose efficient heuristics to utilize certain characteristics of typical circuit design styles to find good partitions for the circuits. A key difference between our approach and earlier approaches to circuit partitioning is that ours is fully automated and does not require any prior knowledge of the type of function being implemented by the circuit.

In this paper, we address bus coding methods for low power core-based systems incorporating narrow buses. Although the conventional bus-invert code performs well for completely random patterns, we show that transition signaling combined with bus-invert, which we call BITS coding, can achieve much more power saving for data patterns of typical DSP applications. The application of BITS coding to a real circuit design is limited by the overhead of the encoder and decoder circuits and the extra bus line introduced. We propose an approximate version of BITS coding, which does not require the extra bus line while retaining the advantage of BITS coding.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835099","","Capacitance;Costs;Decoding;Digital signal processing;Digital signal processing chips;Encoding;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Pins;Power systems","digital integrated circuits;encoding;low-power electronics","BITS coding;low power core-based systems;low power systems;narrow bus encoding;narrow data buses;transition signaling","","0","","13","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A systematic technique is developed for low power mapping of FIR filters to architectures with arbitrary number of multipliers and adders. Power consumed in multipliers is reduced by reducing switching activity at both the data-in as well as the coefficient input. Common input operands can be exposed unfolding, which, however leads to a memory Increase. Simulation are obtained for folding 65 and 129 tap bandpass FIR filters. The average power consumed in a multiplier for a fixed number of hardware multipliers with varying unfolding factors is compared. It is observed that most of the gains due to unfolding are obtained for relatively small unfolding factors and therefore for relatively small memory area overhead. Depending on the unfolding factor employed the average power consumed in a multiplier is seen to reduce anywhere from 54.75% to 81.73% when transpose FIR filters are synthesized as opposed to synthesizing direct-form FIR filters with no unfolding.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835087","","Digital filters;Digital signal processing;Electronic mail;Energy consumption;Finite impulse response filter;Hardware;Lead;Military computing;Resource management;Throughput","FIR filters;band-pass filters;circuit CAD;circuit simulation;digital filters;minimisation;power consumption","digital filters;direct-form FIR filters;low power folded programmable coefficient;low power mapping;memory area overhead;power consumption;switching activity;time-multiplexed programmable-coefficient FIR filters;unfolding factors","","5","7","18","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various coding schemes have been proposed in the literature to encode the input signal in order to reduce the number of transitions. Reducing number of transitions comes in exchange for redundancy in data transferred over the buses. For a given amount of redundancy there exists a lower bound on the average number of transitions. In recent times noise and reliability problems have brought the peak/instantaneous power consumed in VLSI systems to prominence. There has been limited study done on reducing the number of instantaneous transitions and hence the peak power consumed in buses. In this paper, we model a bus with a limit on the maximum instantaneous transition activity as a constrained channel and derive an upper bound on the data-rate obtainable using the capacity of the underlying channel. We then demonstrate that some existing bus encoding schemes are near-optimal with respect to the derived bounds thus, perhaps, obviating the need to search for newer more complicated coding schemes. Also considered is a bus with a constraint on number of transitions in a fixed number of (k) bus transmissions. The capacity of such a bus is derived in the same manner as a bus with a constraint on maximum instantaneous transition activity.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835100","","Capacitance;Data communication;Energy consumption;Power dissipation;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Read-write memory;Redundancy;Upper bound;Very large scale integration","VLSI;capacitance;digital integrated circuits;encoding;graph theory;low-power electronics;redundancy","VLSI systems;constrained channel;data transmission;high capacitance buses;instantaneous transition activity;peak-limited transition activity;power dissipation;redundancy","","0","","11","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Congestion minimization is least understood, however, it models routability most accurately. In this paper, we study the congestion minimization problem during placement. First we point out that the bounding box router used previously is not an accurate measurement of the congestion in the placement. We use a realistic global router to evaluate congestion in the placement stage. This ensures that the final placement is truely congestion minimized. We also propose two new post processing algorithms, the flow-based cell-centric algorithm and the net-centric algorithm. While the flow-based cell-centric algorithm can move multiple cells at the same time to minimize the congestion, it suffers large consumption of memory. Experimental results show that the net-centric algorithm can effectively identify the congested spots in the placement and reduce the congestion. It can produce on an average 7.7% less congestion than the bounding box router method. Finally, we use a final global router to verify that the placement obtained from our algorithm has 39% less congestion than a wirelength-optimized placement obtained by TimberWolf (commercial version 1.3.1).","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835094","","Circuits;Costs;Minimization;Routing;Testing;Timing;Vents;Very large scale integration;Wires;Wiring","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;minimisation;network routing","VLSI layout;congestion minimization;flow-based cell-centric algorithm;global router;net-centric algorithm;placement;post processing algorithms;routability modelling;routing congestion","","13","43","12","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A cubic spline interpolation between inductance at low and very high frequency gives a good result over entire frequency range.

This methodology consists of a compact model and a unique algorithm. The ratio based model simplifies the aging I-V characteristics of MOSFET over time into the aged timing and the corresponding ratio at gate-level. A new algorithm is proposed including a gate primitive decomposition method and an aged slew rate propagation method. This algorithm provides good stress representation and can achieve comparable accuracy with the conventional transistor-level approach. The above methodology has been implemented in a new simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the simulator based on this methodology realizes full-chip circuit capacity and can be applied to various reliability analyses including degradation-sensitive critical paths and clock skew.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835112","","Aging;Analytical models;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Degradation;Hot carriers;MOSFET circuits;Stress;Timing;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;ageing;circuit simulation;hot carriers;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;timing","I-V characteristics;VLSI;clock skew;compact model;degradation-sensitive critical paths;full-chip circuit capacity;gate primitive decomposition method;gate-level aged timing simulation methodology;hot-carrier reliability assurance;ratio based model;slew rate propagation method;stress representation;transistor-level approach","","0","8","13","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The time to calculate a modular exponentiation is about n/sup 2/ clock cycles, where n is the word length, and the clock cycle is roughly equal to the delay time of a full adder.

To overcome this problem, we present two adaptive preconditioners that dynamically exploit the properties of the harmonic balance Jacobian.

The rapidly increasing design complexity, combined with the demand for the capability of handling nearly flattened designs for physical hierarchy generation, poses significant challenges to existing placement algorithms. There are very few studies on understanding the optimality and scalability of placement algorithms, due to the limited sizes of existing benchmarks and limited knowledge of optimal solutions. The contribution of this paper includes two parts: (1) we implemented an algorithm for generating synthetic benchmarks that have known optimal wirelengths and can match any given net distribution vector; (2) using benchmarks of 10K to 2M placeable modules with known optimal solutions, we studied the optimality and scalability of three state-of-the-art placers, Dragon (M. Wang et al, Proc. Int. Conf. on CAD, pp. 260-264, 2000), Capo (A.E. Caldwell et al, Proc. Design Automation Conf., pp. 477-482, 2000), mPL (K. Sze, 2002) from academia, and one leading edge industrial placer, QPlace from Cadence. For the first time our study reveals the gap between the results produced by these tools versus true optimal solutions. The wirelengths produced by these tools are 1.66 to 2.53 times the optimal in the worst cases, and are 1.46 to 2.38 times the optimal on the average. As for scalability, the average solution quality of each tool deteriorates by an additional 4% to 25% when the problem size increases by a factor of 10. These results indicate significant room for improvement in existing placement algorithms.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195099","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Computer science;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Logic design;Partitioning algorithms;Process design;Scalability","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit metallisation;network routing","Cadence QPlace;Capo;DSM technologies;Dragon;IC design process;circuit performance bottleneck;design complexity;flattened designs;mPL;net distribution vector;on-chip interconnects;optimal wirelengths;optimality;physical hierarchy generation;placeable module benchmarks;placement algorithms;scalability;synthetic benchmarks","","18","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Communications among components have to be conducted using a common protocol, however, IPs available today use various communication protocols. Thus the protocol conversion is one of the most important topics in IP-based design (Gajski et al., 2000). In this paper, we propose a method for automatic protocol transducer synthesis which is applicable to complex protocols. The main idea of our proposed method is division of the exploration space into smaller ones for avoiding explosion of the exploration space, namely with a divide and conquer approach.

In this paper, we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global multiterminal nets given an existing buffer block plan. We give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999) [see also Albrecht (2000) and Dragan et al. (2000)]. Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. In addition, our algorithm allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection and observes buffer parity constraints. Most importantly, and unlike previous works on the problem, we take into account multiterminal nets. Our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for the problem, which are based on 2-pin decompositions of the nets. The algorithm has been validated on top-level layouts extracted from a recent high-end microprocessor design","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913291","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific integrated circuits;Computer science;Educational institutions;High performance computing;Inverters;Mathematics;Repeaters;Routing;Upper bound","application specific integrated circuits;circuit layout CAD;integer programming;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;network routing","block-based ASIC methodologies;buffer blocks;buffer insertion;buffer interval bounds;buffer parity constraints;global buffering;global multiterminal nets;high-performance global interconnect;multiterminal multicommodity flow approximation;structured-custom ASIC methodologies;top-level layouts;wirelength upper bounds per connection","","5","1","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In traditional floor planners, area minimization is an important issue. Due to the recent advances in VLSI technology, interconnect has become a dominant factor to the overall performance of a circuit. Routability prediction is thus very important in the floorplanning stage. In this paper, we propose a new congestion model to predict the congestion after detailed routing which is not confined to the assumption of shortest Manhattan distance routes. We have compared our new models and some existing models with the actual congestion measures obtained by global routing some placement results (using the Capo placer as stated in A. E. Caldwell et al. (2000)) with a publicly available maze router. Results show that our models can make significant improvement in estimation accuracy over the other models.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466534","","Computer science;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Prediction methods;Predictive models;Routing;Shape;Tiles;Very large scale integration;Wiring","VLSI;circuit optimisation;network routing","VLSI technology;area minimization;congestion prediction;estimation accuracy improvement;global routing;maze router;routability optimization;shortest Manhattan distance routes","","0","","13","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"FastRoute 2.0: A High-quality and Efficient Global Router","Min Pan; Chu, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA","Design Automation Conference, 2007. ASP-DAC '07. Asia and South Pacific","20070507","2007","","","250","255","Because of the increasing dominance of interconnect issues in advanced IC technology, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into early design stages to get accurate interconnect information. Hence, high-quality and fast global routers are in great demand. In this paper, we propose two major techniques to improve the extremely fast global router, FastRoute (Pan and Chu, 2006) in terms of solution quality : (1) monotonic routing, (2) multi-source multi-sink maze routing. The new router is called FastRoute 2.0. Experimental results show that FastRoute 2.0 can generate high-quality routing solutions with fast runtime compared with three state-of-the-art academic global routers FastRoute, Labyrinth (Kastner et al., 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (Hadsell and Madden, 2003). On the set of benchmarks used in Pan and Chu, 2006 and Hadsell and Madden (2003), the total overflow of FastRoute 2.0 is 98, compared to 1012 (FastRoute), 2846 (Labyrinth) and 1271 (Chi Dispersion Router). The runtime of FastRoute 2.0 is 73% slower than FastRoute, but 78times and 37times faster than Labyrinth and Chi Dispersion router. The promising results make it possible to integrate global routing into early design stages. This could dramatically improve the design solution quality.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196040","","Clocks;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Runtime;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces;Wire","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","FastRoute 2.0;advanced IC technology;design solution quality;extremely fast global router;high-quality routing solutions;monotonic routing;multisource multisink maze routing","","38","1","19","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"New graph bipartizations for double-exposure, bright field alternating phase-shift mask layout","Kahng, A.B.; Vaya, S.; Zelikovsky, A.","Dept. of Comput.

Asia and South Pacific","20020807","2001","","","133","138","We describe new graph bipartization algorithms for layout modification and phase assignment of bright-field alternating phase-shifting masks (AltPSM). The problem of layout modification for phase-assignability reduces to the problem of making a certain layout-derived graph bipartite (i.e., 2-colorable). Previous work by Berman et al. (2000) solves bipartization optimally for the dark field alternating PSM regime. Only one degree of freedom is allowed (and relevant) for such a bipartization: edge deletion, which corresponds to increasing the spacing between features in order to remove phase conflict. Unfortunately, dark-field PSM is used only for contact layers, due to limitations of negative photoresists. Poly and metal layers are actually created using positive photoresists and bright-field masks. In this paper, we define a new graph bipartization formulation that pertains to the more technologically relevant bright-field regime. The previous work by Berman et al. does not apply to this regime. This formulation allows two degrees of freedom for layout perturbation: (i) increasing the spacing between features, and (ii) increasing the width of critical features. Each of these corresponds to node deletion in a new layout-derived graph that we define, called the feature graph. Graph bipartization by node deletion asks for a minimum weight node set A such that deletion of A makes the graph bipartite. Unlike bipartization by edge deletion, this problem is NP-hard. We investigate several practical heuristics for the node deletion bipartization of planar graphs, including one that has 9/4 approximation ratio. Computational experience with industrial VLSI layout benchmarks shows promising results","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913293","","Circuits;Compaction;Computer industry;Computer science;Documentation;Interference;Phase shifters;Protection;Resists;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;design for manufacture;graph theory;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit manufacture;phase shifting masks;photolithography","NP-hard problem;VLSI layout benchmarks;bright field alternating PSM layout;bright-field regime;double-exposure PSM layout;feature graph;graph bipartization algorithms;graph bipartizations;layout modification;layout perturbation;layout-derived graph;node deletion;phase assignment;phase-shift mask layout;planar graphs;two degrees of freedom","","8","20","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern wireless communication standards involve large complexity and highly-multirate behavior, and typically result in long simulation time. The traditional approach for simulating SDF graphs is to compute and execute static single-processor schedules. Nowadays, multi-core processors are increasingly popular for their potential performance improvements through on-chip, thread-level parallelism. However, without novel scheduling and simulation techniques that explicitly explore multithreading capability, current design tools gain only minimal performance improvements. In this paper, we present a new multithreaded simulation scheduler, called MSS, to provide simulation runtime speed-up for executing SDF graphs on multi-core processors. We have implemented MSS in the advanced design system (ADS) from Agilent Technologies. On an Intel dual-core, hyper-threading (4 processing units) processor, our results from this implementation demonstrate up to 3.5 times speed-up in simulating modern wireless communication systems (e.g., WCDMA3G, CDMA 2000, WiMax, EDGE, and Digital TV).","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555833","Multithreaded simulation;Scheduling;Synchronous dataflow","Communication standards;Computational modeling;Multiaccess communication;Multicore processing;Multithreading;Parallel processing;Performance gain;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Wireless communication","processor scheduling;radio networks","advanced design system;multicore processors;multithreaded simulation scheduler;synchronous dataflow graphs;wireless communication systems","","1","","17","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Partial reluctance based circuit simulation is efficient and stable because it is believed that partial reluctance effect is local and partial reluctance matrix is positive definite, although it has not been proved or illustrated clearly. In this paper, we are going to prove that mutual partial reluctance effect between a completely shielded short conductor segment and a conductor segment outside the shield is zero, which implies that the partial reluctance effect is local. Also, an iterative cutting algorithm is proposed to guarantee the strong diagonal dominance of the partial reluctance matrix, which is a sufficient condition for the partial reluctance matrix to be positive definite. With these two characters of partial reluctance, the circuit simulation based on partial reluctance is efficient and stable.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466211","","Capacitance;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Conductors;Copper;H infinity control;Inductance;Magnetic shielding;Sufficient conditions;Wire","circuit simulation;electromagnetic shielding;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections","circuit simulation;completely shielded short conductor segment;iterative cutting algorithm;magnetic field;on-chip inductance effect;partial inductance;partial reluctance;shielding;vector potential","","0","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As feature sizes near the atomic scale, extensive variation and wearout inevitably make margining uneconomical or impossible. The ElastIC project seeks to address this by creating a large-scale chip-multiprocessor that can self-diagnose, adapt, and heal. Creating large, flexible designs in this environment naturally lends itself to the repetitive nature of network-on-chip (NoC), but the loss of a single link or router will result in complete network failure. In this work we present Vicis, an ElastIC-style NoC that can tolerate the loss of many network components due to wearout induced hard faults. Vicis uses the inherent redundancy in the network and its routers in order to maintain correct operation while incurring a much lower area overhead than previously proposed N-modular redundancy (NMR) based solutions. Each router has a built-in-self-test (BIST) that diagnoses the locations of hard fault and runs a number of algorithms to best use ECC, port swapping, and a crossbar bypass bus to mitigate them. The routers work together to run distributed algorithms to solve network-wide problems as well, protecting the networking against critical failures in individual routers. In this work we show that with stuck-at fault rates as high as 1 in 2000 gates, Vicis will continue to operate with approximately half of its routers still functional and communicating.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227053","Built-in-Self-Test;Fault Tolerance;Hard Faults;N-Modular Redundancy;Network-on-Chip;Reconfiguration;Torus","Electric breakdown;Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerance;Network-on-a-chip;Power system management;Redundancy;Silicon;System recovery;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","built-in self test;distributed algorithms;failure analysis;microprocessor chips;network-on-chip;redundancy","ECC;ElastIC project;N-modular redundancy;Vicis;built-in-self-test;crossbar bypass bus;distributed algorithms;hard fault;large-scale chip-multiprocessor;network failure;network redundancy;network-on-chip;port swapping;process scaling;routers;stuck-at fault rates","","19","","24","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
