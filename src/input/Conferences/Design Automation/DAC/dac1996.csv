Based on this concept, EDA programs including circuit optimizer, clock tree synthesis, technology mappers and so on, have been developed.

Different parts of the circuits are tested with different strategies and algorithms to account for their different nature: critical parts of the design, such as the FIFO control unit and the BIST controller are tested with on-line test techniques.

TINA reduces the overall net length to nearly one-fifth compared to a net length unaware enumeration algorithm while using only 1.6% more area and twice the CPU-time. TINA is based on enhanced shape functions that are capable of carrying net length information.

Furthermore, they provide viable synthesis techniques for designs which are too large for synthesis with the conventional method","","0-8186-7573-X","","10.1109/EURDAC.1996.558196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=558196","","Application software;Automata;Circuit synthesis;Design optimization;Encoding;Explosives;Hardware design languages;Programmable logic arrays;Protocols;Tree graphs","computational complexity;finite state machines;optimisation;protocols","complexity;controller optimization;finite state machine synthesis;protocol intensive applications;sequential optimization techniques;state bits;state-based optimization","","6","2","11","","","16-20 Sep 1996","16 Sep 1996-20 Sep 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The target implementation is a pseudo-static asymmetric CMOS complex gate for each output, known as a generalized C-element. The synthesis algorithm generates hazard-free covers for the set and reset functions of each output using Nowick and Dill's (1995) exact hazard-free logic minimization algorithm. Each output circuit is formed by mapping its set and reset logic to N and P stacks of an asymmetric CMOS gate connected to a sustainer; long-series stacks are decomposed into static gates followed by short stacks. A simple heuristic is used to ensure that no short-circuit paths exist from V<sub>dd</sub> to ground. The resulting circuits for small- to medium-size extended burst-mode specifications are 40% smaller and 30% faster than the two-level circuits generated by a 3D synthesis tool, and significantly smaller and faster than the complex-gate circuits generated by the method of Kudva et al.

We propose that, in the former case, some of the flip-flops can be replaced with latches. Since a latch is generally smaller, faster and less power-consuming than a flip-flop, this replacement leads to improvements in circuit area, performance and power consumption. Whether a flip-flop can be replaced with a latch depends on not only its structural context but also its temporal behavior. We first present conditions under which a straightforward replacement can be made; then, we propose two retiming-based transformations that increase the number of replaceable flip-flops. We have implemented the proposed idea in a software called FF2Latch. Experimental results on a set of control-dominated circuits from the high-level synthesis benchmark set show that a large number of the flip-flops can be replaced with latches.

May be even more significant, several products are being offered commercially, and the number of designers using behavioral synthesis is probably in the hundreds. The initial promise of behavioral synthesis, to dramatically increase productivity by elevating the level of design, has been fulfilled. The increase in productivity of behavioral design versus RTL design is typically quoted at 5 times. What came as a surprise to most researchers in the field, is that this is achieved without impacting the quality of results (area, timing)!

One of the main challenges of the designer is to guarantee that the module he/she designs will work correctly in the global design, the details of which, is often unknown to him/her. Modules are open systems whose behavior is subject to the inputs it receives from its environment. It has been shown that verification of open systems (modules) is computationally very hard (EXPTIME complete, 1996) when we consider all possible environments. On the other hand we show that integrating the specification of the properties to be verified with the specification of only the valid input patterns (under which the module is expected to function correctly) gives us a powerful syntax which can be verified in polynomial time. We call the proposed logic Open-CTL (CTL for open systems). The convenience of being able to specify the property and the environment in a unified way in Open-CTL is demonstrated through a study of the PCI Bus properties. We present a symbolic BDD-based verification scheme for checking Open-CTL formulas, and present experimental results on modules from the Texas-97 Verification Benchmark circuits","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995021","","Circuits;Computer science;Data structures;Design engineering;Formal verification;Logic devices;Open systems;Polynomials;Power system modeling;Very large scale integration","binary decision diagrams;formal verification;modules;open systems;symbol manipulation;temporal logic","PCI Bus;VLSI circuit design;formal verification;module;open computation tree logic;open system;symbolic BDD","","5","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But all these algorithms are slow and not scalable. We propose an algorithm, which is fast and scalable with problem size. The main idea of our approach is to specify some important high-level features of the whole routing tree so that it can be broken down into several components. We apply stochastic search to find the best specification. Since we need very few high-level features, the size of stochastic search space is small which can be searched in very less time. The solutions for the components are either pregenerated and stored in lookup tables, or generated by extremely fast algorithms whenever needed. Since it is efficient to obtain solutions for components, it is also efficient to construct and evaluate the whole routing tree for each specification. Experimental results show that, for trees of moderate size, our algorithm is at least several hundred times faster than the recently proposed algorithms. Experimental results also show that the trees generated by our algorithm have almost same delay and resource consumption as the trees generated by SP-tree.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337600","","Circuit optimization;Delay;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Modems;Routing;Stochastic processes;Topology;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;buffer circuits;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;circuit complexity;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","SP-tree;VLSI;buffer insertion;buffer obstacle;integrated circuit design;network topology;routing tree construction algorithm;stochastic search;wire sizing","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

(1994), Takashima et al. (1996) and Wu et al. (1996). It was shown that GRAs have good mapping properties. An H-tree GRA with W/sup 2/+2W switches per switch box (SpSB) and a 2D array GRA with 4W/sup 2/+2W SpSB were proposed by those authors (W is the number of tracks in each switch box). We continue this work by introducing an H-tree GRA with W/sup 2//2+2W SpSB and a 2D array GRA with 3.5 W/sup 2/+2 W SpSB. These new GRAs have the same good mapping properties but use fewer switches.

A fully-automated design flow was used for the entire logic functionality of the chip in order to meet time-to-market requirements. Low die cost (compatible with hand-craft techniques) was achieved by aggressive use of CAD tools, process technology, and filter design techniques. Full functionality on first silicon was achieved by use of standard cell DACs, pads, Amplifier, and Band-Gap reference, and the use of a simulation test-bench which allowed frames of video to be simulated by the chip model, and the resultant simulation output to be captured and viewed on a video monitor. Some of the practical aspects of timing analysis and dynamic power estimation are also described","","0-7803-3702-6","","10.1109/APCAS.1996.569322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569322","","Application specific integrated circuits;Costs;Design automation;Filters;Logic design;Performance gain;Photonic band gap;Signal design;Silicon;Time to market","integrated circuit design;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;video coding","ASIC;CAD tool;PAL/NTSC mixed-signal video encoder;SNR;amplifier;band-gap reference;die cost;differential gain;differential phase;dynamic power estimation;filter design;fully-automated design flow;logic functionality;pad;process technology;silicon chip;simulation;standard cell DAC;time to market;timing analysis","","0","","2","","","18-21 Nov 1996","18 Nov 1996-21 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
