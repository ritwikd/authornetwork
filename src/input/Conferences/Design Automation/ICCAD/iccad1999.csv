"A New RLC Buffer Insertion Algorithm","Zhanyuan Jiang; Shiyan Hu; Jiang Hu; Zhuo Li; Weiping Shi","Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX","Computer-Aided Design, 2006. ICCAD '06. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","553","557","Most existing buffering algorithms neglect the impact of inductance on circuit performance, which causes large error in circuit analysis and optimization. Even for the approaches considering inductance effects, their delay models are too simplistic to catch the actual performance. As delay-length dependence is approaching linear with inductance effect (Ismail and Friedman, 1999), fewer buffers are needed to reduce RLC delay. This motivates this work to propose a new algorithm for RLC buffer insertion. In this paper, a new buffer insertion algorithm considering inductance for intermediate and global interconnect is proposed, based on downstream impedance instead of traditional downstream capacitance. A new pruning technique that provides tremendous speedup and a new frequency estimation method that is very accurate in delay computation are also proposed. Experiments on industrial netlists demonstrate that our new algorithm reduces the number of buffers up to 34.4% over the traditional van Ginneken's algorithm that ignores inductance. Our impedance delay estimation is very accurate compared to SPICE simulations, with only 10% error while the delay model used in the previous RLC algorithm has 20% error (Ismael et al., 2001). The accurate delay model not only reduces the number of buffers, but also brings high fidelity to the buffer solutions. Incorporating slew constraints, the algorithm is accelerated by about 4times with only slight degradation in solution quality","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110230","","Capacitance;Circuit analysis;Circuit optimization;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;Impedance;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;SPICE","RLC circuits;buffer circuits;delay estimation;inductance","RLC buffer insertion algorithm;RLC delay;delay computation;downstream impedance;frequency estimation;impedance delay estimation;pruning technique","","1","","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent works by Cong et al. (1999) and Tang and Wong (2000) give algorithms to solve the buffer block planning problem. In this paper we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global nets given an existing buffer block plan. Assuming that global nets have been already decomposed into two-pin connections, we give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999). Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. Our model allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection. In addition, our algorithm observes buffer parity constraints, i.e., it will choose to use an inverter or a buffer (=co-located pair of inverters) according to source and destination signal parity. The algorithm outperforms previous approaches and has been validated on top-level layouts extracted from a recent high-end microprocessor design.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896458","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer graphics;Computer science;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;High performance computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Inverters;Repeaters;Silicon","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit interconnections","available buffer block plan;buffer parity constraints;global buffering;global interconnect;microprocessor design;top-level layouts","","12","1","25","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
