Usually having level-sensitive latches for their speed, high-performance IC designs need to verify the clock schedules. With process variations, the verification needs to compute the probability of correct clocking. Because of complex statistical correlations, traditional iterative approaches are difficult to get accurate results. Instead, a statistical checking of the structural conditions for correct clocking is proposed, where the central problem is to compute the probability of having a positive cycle in a graph with random edge weights. The proposed method only traverses the graph once to avoid the correlations among iterations, and it considers not only data delay variations but also clock skew variations. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach has an error of 0.14% on average in comparisons with the Monte Carlo simulations.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382650","","Circuits;Clocks;Delay;Design engineering;Iterative methods;Latches;Probability;Processor scheduling;Random variables;Timing","Monte Carlo methods;VLSI;clocks;integrated circuit design;logic design;statistical analysis","Monte Carlo simulations;VLSI fabrication;clock schedule verification;clock skew variations;complex statistical correlations;correct clocking probability;data delay variations;high-performance integrated circuits;iterative approaches;level-sensitive latches;process variations;random edge weights;statistical checking","","3","","16","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose an improved indexing scheme for direct-mapped caches, which drastically reduces the number of conflict misses by using application-specific information; the scheme is based on the selection of a subset of the address bits. With respect to similar approaches, our solution has two main strengths. First, it models the misses analytically by building a miss equation, and exploits a symbolic algorithm to compute the exact optimum solution (i.e., the subset of address bits to be used as cache index that minimizes conflict misses). Second, we designed a re-configurable bit selector, which can be programmed at run-time to fit the optimal cache indexing to a given application. Results show an average reduction of conflict misses of 24%, measured over a set of standard benchmarks, and for different cache configurations.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382556","","Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Buildings;Data structures;Design optimization;Embedded system;Equations;Indexing;Measurement standards;Runtime","binary decision diagrams;cache storage;indexing;optimisation","address bits;application-specific cache optimizations;application-specific information;application-specific re-configurable indexing;cache configurations;cache misses reduction;conflict misses;direct-mapped caches;embedded systems;exact optimum solution;improved indexing scheme;memory access patterns;miss equation;optimal cache indexing;reconfigurable bit selector;symbolic algorithm","","3","2","20","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key ATPG challenge in speed-independent circuits is the generation of patterns that are valid independently of the relative timing and the order of arrival of signals. SPIN-TEST addresses this challenge by guaranteeing fault sensitization with hazard/race-free patterns and response observation that is not affected by oscillations or non-deterministic circuit states.

This is a well-studied topic and a very difficult task (NP-hard). The contributions of This work are as follows: (i) we consider the potential node duplications during the cut enumeration/generation procedure so the mapping costs encoded in the cuts drive the area-optimization objective more effectively; (ii) after the timing constraint is determined, we will relax the non-critical paths by searching the solution space considering both local and global optimality information to minimize mapping area; (iii) an iterative cut selection procedure is carried out that further explores and perturbs the solution space to improve solution quality. We guarantee optimal mapping depth under the unit delay model. Experimental results show that our mapping algorithm, named DAOmap, produces significant quality and runtime improvements. Compared to the state-of-the-art depth-optimal, area minimization mapping algorithm CutMap (Cong and Hwan, 1995), DAOmap is 16.02% better on area and runs 24.2X faster on average when both algorithms are mapping to FPGAs using LUTs of five inputs.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","910","914","As more and more processors and subsystems are integrated in a single system, the verification bottleneck is driving designers away from RTL and RTL-like strategies for verification and design to higher abstraction levels. Increasing system complexity at the other hand requires much faster simulation and analysis tools. This is leading to new standards and tools around transaction level modeling. Languages such as SystemC and SystemVerilog are rich in behavioral and structural constructs which enable modeling designs at different levels of abstraction without imposing a top-down or bottom-up design flow. In fact, most design flows are iterative and modules at different levels of abstractions have to be considered. A more abstract model is very useful to increase simulation speed and to improve formal verification. SystemC and SystemVerilog stress the importance of verification support for complex SOCs including improvement for hardware verification as well as for the verification of hardware dependent software. In todays design flows the software development can often only start after the hardware is available. This causes unacceptable delays for the software development. The idea of transaction level modeling (TLM) is to provide in an early phase of the hardware development transaction level models of the hardware. Based on these TLMs a fast enough simulation environment is the basis for the development of hardware and hardware dependent software. The presumption is to run these transaction level models at several tens or some hundreds of thousand transactions per second which should be fast enough for system level modeling and verification.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382705","","Analytical models;Application software;Bridges;Costs;Formal verification;Hardware;Product development;Programming;Software design;Stress","circuit simulation;formal verification;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling","SystemC language;SystemVerilog;abstract model;behavioral construct;complex SOC;formal verification;hardware dependent software;hardware verification;software development;structural constructs;system complexity;system level design;system level modeling;transaction level modeling","","2","4","5","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In timing validation, the objective is to decide if the timing behavior observed from the silicon is consistent with that predicted by the timing model. At the core of our path-based methodology, we propose a framework to obtain the post-silicon path ranking from observing silicon timing behavior. Then, the consistency is determined by comparing the post-silicon path ranking and the pre-silicon path ranking calculated based on the timing model. Our post-silicon ranking methodology consists of two approaches: ranking optimization and path filtering. We discuss the applications of both approaches and their impacts on the path ranking results. For experiments, we utilize a statistical timing simulator that was developed in the past to derive chip samples and we demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology using benchmark circuits.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382669","","Benchmark testing;Circuit testing;Clocks;Crosstalk;Delay estimation;Filtering;Manufacturing;Predictive models;Silicon;Timing","circuit optimisation;circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;silicon;statistical analysis","path filtering;path-based methodology;post-silicon path ranking;post-silicon timing validation;ranking optimization;silicon timing behavior;statistical timing simulator;timing model","","3","1","26","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","80","87","In recent years, order-reduction techniques based on Krylov subspaces have become the methods of choice for generating macromodels of large multi-port RLC circuits. A widely-used method of this type is PRIMA. Its main features are provably passive reduced-order models and a moment-matching property. On the other hand, PRIMA does not preserve other structures, such as reciprocity or the block structure of the circuit matrices, inherent to RLC circuits, which makes it harder to synthesize the PRIMA models as actual circuits. Moreover, the PRIMA models match only half as many moments as optimal, but non-passive, moment-matching techniques such as SyMPVL. In this paper, we propose the reduction technique SPRIM that overcomes these disadvantages of PRIMA. In particular, SPRIM generates provably passive and reciprocal macromodels of multi-port RLC circuits, and the SPRIM models match twice as many moments as the corresponding PRIMA models obtained with identical computational work. Numerical results are reported that illustrate the higher accuracy of SPRIM vs. PRIMA.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382547","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Electronic circuits;Electronics packaging;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit layout;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematics;RLC circuits;Reduced order systems","circuit simulation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;numerical analysis;reduced order systems","Krylov subspaces;PRIMA models;SPRIM technique;SyMPVL;block structure;circuit matrices;moment-matching property;multi-port RLC circuits;nonpassive moment-matching techniques;order-reduction techniques;passive macromodel;passive reduced-order models;reciprocal macromodels;structure-preserving reduced-order interconnect macromodeling","","48","2","28","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interconnect delays are not scaling in proportion to the clock period and hence multiple stages of FIFOs will be needed for high performance interconnects. FIFOs in the interconnect are a significant contributor to the total power consumption. In this work, we propose a design methodology to synthesize a low power interconnect channel containing series connected FIFOs for latency-insensitive systems. Our approach is the first to consider and simultaneously optimize the channel clock frequency, voltage and the FIFO sizes to minimize the power consumption. For small problem size, we show that our approach finds solutions which are close to optimal. The power aware interconnect channel synthesis is affected by the system parameters like the data production rate and data consumption rate. The choice of optimal channel clock frequency, voltage and FIFO sizes can lead to power savings as high as 77.7%, 83.6% and 87% for a 3 stage, 4 stage and a 5 stage channel respectively.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382586","","Buffer storage;Clocks;Delay;Design methodology;Energy consumption;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Power system interconnection;Relays;Voltage","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics","FIFO size optimization;channel clock frequency;data consumption rate;data production rate;first-in-first-out buffers;latency-insensitive interconnects;latency-insensitive systems;low power interconnect channel;power aware interconnect channel synthesis;power aware interconnect design methodology;power consumption minimization;system level interconnect design methodology;total power consumption;voltage optimization","","2","1","25","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on the communication task. We model errors due to over-aggressive operation and derive a channel model. We show that self-synchronising codes achieve completely reliable communication over this channel model, and study a known example, LEDR (level encoded 2-phase dual-rail), which is an improvement of the well-known dual-rail code. Then, we introduce a family of coding schemes which are a generalisation of LEDR, and study their performance over our channel model. We observe that the wiring overhead can be significantly reduced at the expense of a limited loss in reliability. Finally, we extend our channel model to include additive noise, and show that in this more general situation a specific instance of our coding scheme has similar or better performance than LEDR, at a smaller wiring overhead.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382617","","Additive noise;Application software;Communications technology;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Frequency;Laboratories;Reliability;Voltage;Wiring","codes;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;synchronisation;telecommunication channels","additive noise;channel model;communication task;correct behaviour boundary;error model;level encoded 2-phase dual-rail;reliable communication;self-calibrating communication;soft self-synchronising codes","","6","","11","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-speed mode provides similar power and performance to a traditional routing switch. In low-power mode, speed is curtailed in order to reduce power consumption. Our first switch design reduces leakage power consumption by 36-40% in low-power vs. high-speed mode (on average); dynamic power is reduced by up to 28%. Leakage power in sleep mode is 61% lower than in high-speed mode. A second switch design offers a 36% smaller area overhead and reduces leakage by 28-30% in low-power vs. high-speed mode. The proposed switch designs require only minor changes to a traditional routing switch, making them easy to incorporate into current FPGA interconnect. The applicability of the new switches is motivated through an analysis of timing slack in industrial FPGA designs. Specifically, we show that a considerable fraction of routing switches may be slowed down (operate in low-power mode), without impacting overall design performance.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382647","","Energy consumption;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Integrated circuit interconnections;MOSFETs;Power dissipation;Routing;Switches;Threshold voltage","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;low-power electronics;network routing","FPGA interconnect;FPGA routing switch design;high-speed mode;industrial FPGA designs;leakage power;low-power mode;low-power programmable routing circuitry;power consumption;sleep mode","","14","17","23","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System decomposition and regression analysis are used as the underlying methods to characterize and analyze extensible instructions. We verify our estimation models using automatically and manually generated extensible instructions, plus extensible instructions used in large real-world applications. The mean absolute error of our estimation models arc as small as: 3.4% (6.7% max.) for area overhead, 5.9% (9.4% max.) for latency, and 4.2% (7.2% max.) for power consumption, compared to estimation through the time consuming synthesis and simulation steps using commercial tools.

Simple guard-banding for these effects leads to increased product development times and uncompetitive products. In addition, traditional static timing methodologies are unable to cope with the large number of permutations of process, voltage, and temperature corners created by these independent sources of variation. In this paper we will discuss the sources of variation; by introducing the concepts of systematic inter-die variation, systematic intra-die variation and intra-die random variation. We will show that by treating these forms of variations differently, we can achieve design closure with less guard-banding than traditional methods.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382597","","Application specific integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Delay;Manufacturing industries;Microelectronics;Product development;Semiconductor process modeling;Temperature;Threshold voltage;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging","ASIC timing;environmental variation impact;guard-banding;intra-die random variation;process variation impact;product cycle time;semiconductor process node;semiconductor process variation;systematic inter-die variation;systematic intra-die variation","","41","3","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once the C program satisfies the requirements, the circuit is designed in a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog. It is therefore highly desirable to automatically perform a correspondence check between the C model and a circuit given in HDL. We present an algorithm that checks consistency between an ANSI-C program and a circuit given in Verilog using predicate abstraction. The algorithm exploits the fact that the C program and the circuit share many basic predicates. In contrast to existing tools that perform predicate abstraction, our approach is SAT-based and allows all ANSI-C and Verilog operators in the predicates.

By paying attention to the constraints of off-path inputs in a non-robust test, we made it possible to generate a pair of test vectors to detect multiple delay faults based on the traditional dynamic compaction technique. Delay fault test based on our method is applied to SPARC64 microprocessor with 1.3 GHz clock for screening delay defects, and we achieved 90% coverage with 3,567 test vectors.

Therefore, corresponding MOR (model-order reduction) techniques for second-order systems are desired to efficiently deal with the ever-increasing circuit scale and to preserve essential model properties. We first review the existing MOR methods for RCS circuits, such as ENOR and SMOR, and discuss several key issues related to numerical stability and accuracy of the methods. Then, a technique, SAPOR (second-order Arnoldi method for passive order reduction), is proposed to effectively address these issues. Based on an implementation of a generalized second-order Arnoldi method, SAPOR is numerically stable and efficient.

While they offer mechanisms for better energy efficiency, they also complicate power management decisions in the presence of realtime constraints. A traditional dynamic power management techniques based on localized break-even-time analysis with simple on/off power controls often yield suboptimal if not incorrect results globally. To address these problems, This work presents two core algorithms for reducing idle energy consumption at the component level and system level. The first algorithm discovers the optimal sequence for mode transition over multiple power modes under timing constraints. It assists the second algorithm that performs a sophisticated global search strategy to aggressively explore system-wide energy savings by correctly interpreting the constraints across all subsystems. Experimental results show that in an embedded radio system where idle energy cost matches or exceeds the active energy consumption, our technique can further reduce the idle energy by 50-70%, which translates into 30-50% of overall system energy compared to existing techniques.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382537","","Dynamic voltage scaling;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy management;Power system management;Power system modeling;Time factors;Timing;Voltage control","embedded systems;optimisation;power consumption;software radio","component-level energy minimization;dynamic power management;embedded radio system;energy efficiency;idle energy consumption;idle intervals;localized break-even-time analysis;mode transition sequences;multiple operational power modes;multiple power modes;nonoperational power modes;power controls;realtime constraints;sophisticated global search;system-level energy minimization;system-wide energy savings;timing constraints","","2","","10","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the potential of re-balancing path delays through post-placement applications of clock skew scheduling and in-place retiming cannot be fully realized. In this paper we describe a new placement algorithm that is based on a tight integration of sequential timing analysis in the inner loop of an analytic solver. Instead of minimizing the maximum path delay, our approach minimizes the maximum mean delay on any circuit loop, thus enabling the full optimization potential of clock skew scheduling and in-place retiming. We present two versions of the new algorithm: one approximates sequential criticality and weights wires accordingly (Cong and Lim, 2000), the other extends this with the inclusion of explicit wire-length constraints for loops that limit the final clock period. Our algorithms are implemented using a hybrid, GORDlAN-style sequence of analytical placement steps interleaved with cell partitioning (Kleinhans et al., 1988). Our experiments on a set of large industrial designs demonstrate that the presented placement algorithm can minimize the contribution of interconnection delays to the clock period on average by 23.5% compared to a solution based on combinational delays.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382605","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Delay estimation;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Job shop scheduling;Partitioning algorithms;Registers;Timing;Wires","circuit optimisation;clocks;integrated circuit layout;timing","analytic solver;analytical placement steps;cell partitioning;circuit loop;clock skew scheduling;combinational delays;explicit wire-length constraints;hybrid GORDlAN-style sequence;in-place retiming;interconnection delays;maximum mean delay;maximum path delay;sequential criticality approximation;sequential timing analysis;subsequent sequential optimization;traditional timing-driven placement","","5","13","21","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method constructs an inverter-interconnect based network by exploring the pairwise linear dependencies of the internal scan chain vectors, resulting in a very low cost network that is nonetheless capable of outperforming much costlier compression schemes.

The method can use higher order moments to asymptotically improve the accuracy of the estimated crossing times. This technique bypasses the steps involved in calculating poles and residues to obtain time-domain information. Once q moments are calculated, only 2q multiplications and (q-I) additions are required to determine any threshold crossing time at a certain node. Moreover, this technique avoids other problems such as pole instability. Several orders of approximations are presented for different threshold crossing times depending on the number of moments involved. For example, the worst case error of a first to a seventh order (single to seven moments) approximation of 50% RC delay is 1650%, 192.26%, 11.31%, 3.37%, 2.57%, 2.56%, and 1.43%, respectively. If the whole waveform is required it can be easily determined by interpolation between different threshold crossing points.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","668","675","Cycle-accurate functional descriptions (CAFD) are being widely adopted in integrated circuit (IC) design flows. Power estimation can potentially benefit from the inherent increase in simulation efficiency of cycle-based functional simulation. Currently, most approaches to hardware power estimation operate at the register-transfer level (RTL), or lower levels of design abstraction. Attempts at power estimation for functional descriptions have suffered from poor accuracy because the design decisions performed during their synthesis lead to an unavoidable, large uncertainty in any power estimate that is based solely on the functional description. We propose a methodology for CAFD power estimation that combines the accuracy achieved by power estimation at the structural RTL with the efficiency of cycle-accurate functional simulation. We achieve this goal by viewing a CAFD as an abstraction of a specific, known RTL implementation that is synthesized from it. We identify correlations between a CAFD and its RTL implementation, and ""back-annotate"" information into the CAFD solely for the purpose of power estimation. The resulting RTL-aware CAFD contains a layer of code that instantiates virtual placeholders for RTL components, and maps values of CAFD variables into the RTL components' inputs/outputs, thus enabling efficient and accurate power estimation. Power estimation is performed in our methodology by simply co-simulating the RTL-aware CAFD with a simulatable power model library that contains power macro-models for each RTL component. We present techniques to further improve the speed of CAFD power estimation, through the use of control state-based adaptive power sampling. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed techniques in the context of a commercial C-based hardware design flow. Experiments with a number of large industrial designs (up to 1 million gates) demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves accuracy very close to RTL power estimation with two-to-three orders of magnitude speedup in estimation times.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382659","","Adaptive control;Circuit simulation;Complexity theory;Hardware;Libraries;Programmable control;Sampling methods;Space exploration;State estimation;System-level design","circuit simulation;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;power consumption","C-based hardware design flow;RTL components;control state-based adaptive power sampling;cycle-accurate functional descriptions;cycle-based functional simulation;integrated circuit design flows;power estimation;power macro-models;power model library;register-transfer level;virtual placeholders","","3","2","30","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gray-box model keeps a coupling graph and lists the conditions on relative input arrival time combinations for couplings not to take effect. The black-box model stores the output response windows for a basic set of relative input arrival time combinations, and computes the output arrival time for any given input arrival time combination through the union of some combinations in the basic set. Both macro-models are conservative, and can greatly reduce the pessimism existing in the conventional ""pin-to-pin"" model.

We address the problem of minimizing the energy consumed by a two-device data flow chain by choosing the speed profiles of the two devices and the ""cycle time"" of the intermediate buffer. Determining the speed profiles (functions of time) to minimize the energy functional, in general, requires variational techniques. However, based on certain observations about device power-speed relations and application performance constraints, we were able to solve the problem analytically in two steps - device characterization and cycle time optimization. The effectiveness of the technique was demonstrated for two practical applications of dataflow chains - CD recording and VCD playback with up to 45% and 64% energy improvements, respectively.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382585","","CD recording;Decoding;Disk drives;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency;Hard disks;Optical buffering;Streaming media;Voltage","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;power consumption","CD recording;VCD playback;cycle time optimization;device characterization;device power-speed relations;device speed profile;energy consumption minimization;energy optimization;multiple power-consuming devices;portable devices;two-device data flow chain","","1","","22","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","626","631","In present day VLSI ICs, intra-die processing variations are becoming harder to control, resulting in a large skew in the clock signals at the end of the clock distribution network. We describe a buffered H-tree technique to distribute the clock signal and to de-skew a clock network. The clock shielding wires (which are connected to GND in normal operation) are, in de-skewing mode, used to selectively return the clock signal for de-skewing, and for serial communication with the clock distribution sites for skew adjustment. Our forward and return clock networks are buffered, with identically sized and co-located wires and buffers. This results in both these networks exhibiting identical delay characteristics in the presence of intra-die process variations. Unlike existing approaches, our method utilizes a single phase detection circuit, and can achieve a very low maximum chip-level clock skew. This skew value is not dependent on the resolution of the phase detector. Further, our technique can be applied dynamically, either at boot time or periodically during the operation of the IC, as necessary. Additionally, our buffered H-tree enables us to implement efficient clock gating by allowing the user to turn off clocks in the distribution network itself, thus disabling entire sections of the clock network. We demonstrate the utility of our technique on a 6-level H-tree clock distribution network. In a clock distribution network which is initially skewed by up to 300ps, our technique can de-skew signals to within 4ps of each other. We show that the total wiring area of our clock distribution and de-skewing methodology is about 35% higher than a traditional H-tree (which does not have a deskewing functionality), while the active logic area overhead is about 25%. The power consumption of our network is 5% lower than that of a traditional H-tree network with no de-skewing functionality.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382651","","Circuits;Clocks;Detectors;Energy consumption;Logic;Phase detection;Signal processing;Very large scale integration;Wires;Wiring","VLSI;circuit optimisation;clocks;integrated circuit design;logic design;phase detectors","VLSI integrated circuit;buffered H-tree technique;chip-level clock skew;clock distribution network;clock distribution sites;clock gating;clock shielding wires;clock signals;de-skewing mode;delay characteristics;dynamic de-skewing methodology;intra-die processing variations;phase detector;serial communication;single phase detection circuit;skew adjustment","","25","","13","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the problem of finding a minimal width tree decomposition for an arbitrary graph is NP complete. The available tools and methods are impractical, as they cannot handle large and hard-to-solve CNF-SAT instances. This work proposes a hypergraph partitioning based constraint decomposition technique as an alternative to contemporary methods. We model the CNF-SAT problem on a hypergraph and apply min-cut based bi-partitioning. Clause-variable statistics across the partitions are analyzed to further decompose the problem, iteratively. The resulting tree-like decomposition provides a variable order for guiding CNF-SAT search. Experiments demonstrate that our partitioning procedure is fast, scalable and the derived variable order results in significant increase in performance of the SAT engine.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382629","","Circuits;Cities and towns;Computational complexity;Engines;Information analysis;Statistical analysis;Tree data structures;Tree graphs","computability;computational complexity;constraint theory;logic design;optimisation;search problems;trees (mathematics)","CNF-SAT search;NP complete;arbitrary graph;clause-variable statistics;constraint decomposition technique;efficient constraint partitioning;hypergraph partitioning;min-cut based bi-partitioning;minimum tree-width decompositions","","4","","15","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classical examples are power supply networks, clock distribution networks, large data buses, etc. Various applications would benefit from efficient high level models of such networks. Unfortunately the existing model-order-reduction algorithms are not adapted to handle more than a few tens of terminals. This talk introduces RecMOR, an algorithm for the computation of reduced order models of structured linear circuits with numerous I/O ports. The algorithm exploits certain regularities of the subcircuit response that are typical in numerous applications of interest. When these regularities are present, the normally dense matrix-transfer function of the subcircuit contains sub-blocks that in some sense are significantly low rank and can be compactly modeled by the recently introduced SVDMOR algorithm. The new RecMOR algorithm decomposes the large matrix-transfer function recursively, and applies SVDMOR compression adaptively to the sub-blocks of the transfer function. The result is a reduced order model that is sparse, efficient, and directly usable as an efficient substitute of the subcircuit in circuit simulations. The method is illustrated on several circuit examples.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382548","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382548","","Art;Clocks;Data buses;Linear circuits;Matrices;Matrix decomposition;Power supplies;Process design;Reduced order systems;Very large scale integration","VLSI;analogue integrated circuits;circuit simulation;reduced order systems;transfer function matrices","RecMOR;SVDMOR algorithm;circuit simulations;efficient high level models;efficient reduced order modeling;large number of terminals;linear subcircuits;matrix-transfer function;model-order-reduction algorithms;numerous I/O ports;sparse reduced order modeling;state-of-the art VLSI circuit;structured linear circuits;subcircuit response","","22","","7","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional routing algorithms can not handle these challenges effectively, and many high-end designs in the industry require manual routing efforts. In this paper, we propose a problem decomposition that distinguishes routing within dense components from routing in the intermediate area. In particular, we propose an effective methodology to find the escape routing solution for multiple components simultaneously such that the number of crossings in the intermediate area is minimized. For this, we model the problem as a longest path with forbidden pairs (LPFP) problem, and propose two algorithms for it. The first is an exact polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the maximal planar routing solution on one layer. The second is a randomized algorithm that has good scalability characteristics for large circuits. Then we use these algorithms to assign the maximal subset of planar nets to each layer, and then distribute the remaining nets at the end. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms through experiments on industrial circuits.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382689","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Complexity theory;Computer science;Nonhomogeneous media;Packaging;Pins;Polynomials;Routing;Scalability","circuit complexity;network routing;printed circuit design;randomised algorithms","PCB routing problem;dense PCB;exact polynomial-time algorithm;industrial circuits;layer assignment;longest path with forbidden pairs problem;maximal planar routing solution;maximal subset;planar nets;randomized algorithm;simultaneous escape routing","","15","1","12","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Timing analyzers attempt to capture the effects of variation on delay with simplified models. The timing verification of RC or RLC networks requires the substitution of such simplified models with spatial stochastic processes that capture the random nature of process variations. The present work proposes a new and viable method to compute the stochastic response of interconnects. The technique models the stochastic response in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space in terms of orthogonal polynomial expansions. A finite representation is obtained by using the Galerkin approach of minimizing the Hilbert space norm of the residual error. The key advance of the proposed method is that it provides a functional representation of the response of the system in terms of the random variables that represent the process variations. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a procedure called OPERA, results from OPERA simulations on commercial design test cases match well with those from the classical Monte Carlo SPICE simulations and from perturbation methods. Additionally OPERA shows good computational efficiency: speedup factor of 60 has been observed over Monte Carlo SPICE simulations.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382698","","Computational modeling;Degradation;Hilbert space;Integrated circuit interconnections;Monte Carlo methods;Performance analysis;RLC circuits;SPICE;Stochastic processes;Timing","Galerkin method;Hilbert spaces;Monte Carlo methods;SPICE;circuit simulation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;stochastic processes","Galerkin approach;Monte Carlo SPICE simulations;OPERA;RC networks;RLC networks;commercial design test cases;deep sub-micron circuits;delay variation;finite representation;functional representation;infinite dimensional Hilbert space;interconnect deformations;interconnect performance degradation;orthogonal polynomial expansions;perturbation methods;process variations;random variables;residual error;simplified models;stochastic analysis;stochastic response;timing analyzers;timing verification","","35","3","28","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The novelty of our approach is in the use of circuit-based cofactoring to capture a large set of states, and in the use of a functional hashing based simplified circuit graph to represent the captured states. We also propose a number of heuristics to further enlarge the state set represented per enumeration, thereby reducing the number of enumeration steps. We have implemented our techniques in a SAT-based UMC framework where we show the effectiveness of SAT-based existential quantification on public benchmarks, and on a number of large industry designs that were hard to model check using purely BDD-based techniques. We show several orders of improvement in time and space using our approach over previous CNF-based approaches.

These effects mitigate correlated variations' impact on delay changes across a die. Temperature has a small effect, and supply distribution can be well-understood and designed. Furthermore, uncorrelated (random) variations (e.g. RDF, & LER) currently have a small impact on speed-setting paths, and even multiplying their effect (as processes shrink), would not make them very significant.

To balance the skew that can be caused by process variations, programmable delay elements are inserted at the clock inputs of a small set of flip-flops on the timing critical paths. A delay-fault testing scheme combined with linear programming is used to identify and eliminate timing violations in the manufactured chips.

While many interconnect reliability models assume a constant temperature, this paper presents a physics-based model for estimating interconnect lifetime for any time-varying temperature/current profile. This model is verified with numerical solutions. With this model, we show that designers may be more aggressive with the temperature profiles that are allowed on a chip. In fact, our model reveals that when the temperature magnitude variation is small, average temperature (instead of worst-case temperature) can be used to accurately predict interconnect lifetime, allowing for significant design margin reclamation in reliability-aware design. Even when the variation of temperature magnitude is large, our model shows that using the maximum temperature is still too conservative for interconnect lifetime prediction. Therefore, our model not only increases the accuracy of reliability estimates, but also enables designers to consider more aggressive designs. This model is similarly useful for temperature-aware dynamic runtime management.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382595","","Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Costs;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit packaging;Life estimation;Predictive models;Temperature;Thermal factors;Thermal stresses","electromigration;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;thermal management (packaging)","IC package cost;circuit performance;design margin reclamation;dynamic stress;electromigration;high-performance circuit design;interconnect lifetime prediction;interconnect reliability models;leakage power;physics-based model;reliability-aware design;temperature dependence;temperature magnitude variation;temperature-aware dynamic runtime management;thermal effects;time-varying current profile;time-varying temperature profile","","15","","18","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main criteria of consideration in these experiments is how (un)reliably various models from the literature detect routing hot-spots. We conclude that such models appear to be too unreliable for detailed placement optimization. Second, motivated by the first result, we present a unified combinatorial framework in which cell placement and exact routing structures are captured and optimized; the framework relies on the trunk-decomposition of global routing structures and optimization is performed by a generalized optimal interleaving algorithm (Hur and Lillis, 2000). A proof of concept implementation of this framework is studied in the FPGA domain.

For emerging technologies (65 nm and following) the computation cost and complexity of these techniques are themselves becoming bottlenecks in the design-silicon flow. This has motivated the recent calls for restrictive design rules such as fixed width/pitch/orientation of gate-forming polysilicon features. We have been exploring how design might take advantage of these restrictions, and present some preliminary ideas for how we might reduce the computational cost throughout the back end of the design flow through the post-tapeout data processes while improving quality of results: the reliability of OPC/RET algorithms and the accuracy of models of manufactured products. We also believe that the underlying technology, including simulation and analysis, may be applicable to a variety of approaches to design for manufacturability (DFM).","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382674","","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Design automation;Design for manufacture;Lithography;Manufactured products;Shape;Virtual manufacturing","circuit CAD;design for manufacture;lithography;manufacturing processes","OPC algorithms;RET algorithms;altPSM;backend CAD flows;deep-subwavelength technologies;design flow;design for manufacturability;gate-forming polysilicon features;lithography;optical proximity correction;post-tapeout data process;restrictive design rules;shape fill","","16","3","","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The temporal behavior of these cyclic definitions may be meant to be combinational rather than sequential. Most prior approaches to analyzing cyclic combinational circuits were built upon the formulation of ternary-valued simulation at the circuit level. This work shows the limitation of this formulation and investigates, at the functional level, the most general condition where cyclic definitions are semantically combinational. It turns out that the prior formulation is a special case of our treatment. Our result admits strictly more flexible high-level specifications. Furthermore, it allows a higher-level analysis of combinationality, and, thus, no costly synthesis of a high-level description into a circuit netlist before combinationality analysis can be performed. With our formulation, when the target is software implementations, combinational cycles need not be broken as long as the execution of the underlying system obeys a sequencing execution rule. For hardware implementations, combinational cycles are broken and replaced with acyclic equivalents at the functional level to avoid malfunctioning in the final physical realization.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382610","","Analytical models;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Combinational circuits;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Performance analysis;Process control;Real time systems;Resource management","circuit simulation;combinational circuits;high level synthesis","breakable cyclic definitions;circuit netlist;combinational cycles;combinationality analysis;concurrent module definition;cyclic combinational circuit analysis;cyclic dependencies;hardware implementations;hardware system design;high-level description;high-level specifications;real-time process control;semantically combinational cyclic definition;sequencing execution rule;ternary-valued simulation","","1","","","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the rate of transient faults (i.e., soft errors caused, for example, by cosmic ray radiations) also depends on system operating frequency and supply voltage. Thus, there is an interesting trade-off between system reliability and energy consumption. This work first investigates the effects of frequency and voltage scaling on the fault rate and proposes two fault rate models based on previously published data. Then, the effects of energy management on reliability are studied. Our analysis results show that, energy management through frequency and voltage scaling could dramatically reduce system reliability, and ignoring the effects of energy management on the fault rate is too optimistic and may lead to unsatisfied system reliability.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382539","","Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy management;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Frequency;Real time systems;Redundancy;Reliability;Voltage","embedded systems;fault simulation;power control;reliability;system recovery;transients","energy consumption;energy management;fault rate models;frequency and voltage scaling;operating frequency;real-time embedded systems;recovery schemes;slack time;supply voltage;system reliability;transient faults","","54","","29","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some work has been done in the recent years to infer the use of the carry-save representation in the synthesis of arithmetic circuits. Yet, many cases of practical interest cannot be handled due to the scattering of logic operations among the arithmetic ones - especially in arithmetic computations which are originally described at the bit level in high-level languages such as C. We therefore introduce an algorithm to restructure dataflow graphs so that they can be synthesized in high-quality arithmetic circuits, close, to those that an expert designer would conceive. On typical embedded software benchmarks which could be advantageously implemented with hardware accelerators, our technique always reduces tangibly the critical path by up to 46% and generally achieves the quality of manual implementations.

Current BMC techniques repeatedly concatenate the original transition relation to unfold the circuit with increasing depths. In this paper we present a method that is based on a dual unfolding scheme. The first unfolding is non-initialized and progressively simplifies concatenated frames of the transition relation. The tail of the simplified frames is then applied in the second unfolding, which starts from the initial state and checks the properties. We use a circuit graph representation for all functions and perform simplification by merging vertices that are functionally equivalent under given input constraints. In the noninitialized unfolding, previous time frames progressively tighten these constraints thus leading to an asymptotic simplification of the transition relation. As a side benefit, our method can find inductive invariants constructively by detecting when vertices are functionally equivalent across time frames. This information is then used to further simplify the transition relation and, in some cases, prove unbounded correctness of properties. Our experiments using industrial property checking problems demonstrate that the presented method significantly improves the efficiency of BMC.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382542","","Circuits;Concatenated codes;Detection algorithms;Engines;Heuristic algorithms;History;Industrial relations;Merging;Safety;Tail","Boolean functions;circuit analysis computing;graphs;industrial property","asymptotic simplification;bounded model checking;bounded property checking;circuit graph representation;concatenated frames;dual unfolding scheme;dynamic transition relation simplification;functionally equivalent;inductive invariants;industrial property checking problems;input constraints;limited execution length;noninitialized unfolding;simplified frames;time frames","","29","2","30","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the small transistors in SRAM cells are particularly sensitive to these variations. The SRAM cell transistors in sub-100-nm designs may contain fewer than 100 channel dopant atoms. To achieve a robust design with such variability, one must enhance the normal static-noise-margin and write-trip-point analysis, often with Monte Carlo simulations using statistical transistor models including the process and mismatch fluctuations. Similar challenges exist for the sense amplifiers normally used with SRAM arrays. Except with very low speed designs, yield to speed can be substantially reduced by variations between nominally matched sense amplifier transistors as well as by the variability resulting in a very worst memory cell low read current. This also increases the hazards of delay timing with dummy paths and dummy cells and increases the need for at-speed testing prior to repair.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382599","","Circuits;Fluctuations;Monte Carlo methods;Noise measurement;Random access memory;Robustness;Semiconductor process modeling;Sun;Timing;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;SRAM chips;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;nanoelectronics;transistors","Monte Carlo simulation;SRAM cell transistors;SRAM design variability;at-speed testing;channel dopant atoms;memory cell low read current;mismatch fluctuation;nominally matched sense amplifier transistors;normal static-noise-margin;process fluctuation;statistical transistor models;sub-100nm SRAM designs;write-trip-point analysis","","55","3","21","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The macromodels are based on combining a scalar, nonlinear phase equation with a small linear time-varying system to capture slowly-dying amplitude variations. The comprehensive macromodels are able to correctly predict oscillator response in the presence of interference at far lower computational cost than that of full SPICE-level simulation. We also present an efficient numerical method for capturing injection locking in oscillators, thereby improving on the classic technique of Adler (1946) in terms of accuracy and applicability to any kind of oscillator. We demonstrate the proposed techniques on LC and ring oscillators, comparing results from the macromodels against full SPICE-like simulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate speed tips of orders of magnitude, while retaining excellent accuracy.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382663","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Frequency;Injection-locked oscillators;Interference;Nonlinear equations;Ring oscillators;SPICE","SPICE;circuit simulation;injection locked oscillators","LC oscillators;SPICE-level simulation;amplitude macromodels;amplitude variations;automated oscillator macromodelling technique;injection locking;nonlinear phase equation;oscillator response;phase macromodels;ring oscillators;scalar phase equation;small linear time-varying system","","20","","16","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"DAG-aware circuit compression for formal verification","Bjesse, P.; Boralv, A.","Synopsys Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Computer Aided Design, 2004. ICCAD-2004. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","42","49","The choice of representation for circuits and Boolean formulae in a formal verification tool is important for two reasons. First of all, representation compactness is necessary in order to keep the memory consumption low. This is witnessed by the importance of maximum processable design size for equivalence checkers. Second, many formal verification algorithms are sensitive to redundancies in the design that is processed. To address these concerns, three different auto-compressing representations for Boolean circuit networks and formulas have been suggested in the literature. We attempt to find a blend of features from these alternatives that allows us to remove as much redundancy as possible while not sacrificing runtime. By studying how the network representation size varies when we change parameters, we show that the use of only one operator node is suboptimal, and demonstrate that the most powerful of the proposed reduction rules, two-level minimization, actually can be harmful. We correct the bad behavior of two-level optimization by devising a simple linear simplification algorithm that can remove tens of thousands of nodes on examples where all obvious redundancies already have been removed. The combination of our compactor with the simplest representation outperforms all of the alternatives we have studied, with a theoretical runtime bound that is at least as good as the three studied representations.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382541","","Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Circuit analysis;Data structures;Formal verification;Interpolation;Logic;Minimization;Process design;Runtime","Boolean functions;circuit analysis computing;computability;formal verification;minimisation;redundancy","Boolean circuit networks;Boolean formulae;DAG-aware circuit compression;auto-compressing representations;circuits representation;equivalence checkers;formal verification;linear simplification algorithm;memory consumption;network representation size;operator node;processable design size;reduction rules;representation compactness;theoretical runtime;two-level optimization","","13","3","23","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The subsequent pattern is loaded by efficiently performing the necessary changes on the template through the functionality provided by the new architecture, conceptually exploiting the inherent low specified bit density of the test patterns. We explore the space of possible design alternatives built on the CircularScan architecture; the design alternatives are presented with accompanying test application methods.

Multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) technology has become a popular technique for standby power reduction. Sleep transistor insertion in circuits is an effective application of MTCMOS technology for reducing leakage power. In This work we present a fine grained approach where each gate in the circuit is provided an independent sleep transistor. Key advantages of this approach include better circuit slack utilization and improvements in signal integrity (which is a major disadvantage in clustering based approaches). To this end, we propose an optimal polynomial time fine grained sleep transistor sizing algorithm. We also prove the selective sleep transistor placement problem as NP-complete and propose an effective heuristic. Finally, in order to reduce the sleep transistor area penalty (which might get high since clustering is not performed), we propose a placement area constrained sleep transistor sizing formulation. Our experiments show that on an average the sleep transistor placement and optimal sizing algorithm gave 69.7% and 59.0% savings in leakage power as compared to the conventional fixed delay penalty algorithms for 5 and 7% circuit slowdown respectively. Moreover the post placement area penalty was less than 5% which is comparable to clustering schemes according to Mohab Anis et al.

There are three Vdd states for interconnect switches: high Vdd, low Vdd and power-gating. We develop a simple design flow to apply high Vdd to critical paths and low Vdd to non-critical paths and to power gate unused interconnect switches. We carry out a highly quantitative study by placing and routing benchmark circuits in 100 nm technology to illustrate the power saving. Compared to single-Vdd FPGAs with optimized but nonprogrammable Vdd level for the same target clock frequency, our new FPGA fabric on average reduces interconnect power by 56.51% and total FPGA power by 50.55%. Due to the highly low utilization rate of routing switches, majority of the power reduction is achieved by power gating unused routing buffers. In contrast, recent work that considers Vdd programmability only for logic fabric reduces total FPGA power merely by 14.29%.

We address this problem by using an array of dynamic PLAs which require only metal and via mask customization in order to implement a new design. This would allow several similar-sized designs to share the same base set of masks (right up to the metal layers) and only have different metal and via masks. We have implemented our methodology for both combinational and sequential designs, and demonstrate that our approach strikes a reasonable compromise between ASIC and field programmable design methodologies in terms of placed-and-routed area and delay.

Importantly, ROAD sets up all design constraints to include large-scale process variations to facilitate the tradeoff between yield and performance. A novel convex formulation of the robust design problem is utilized to improve the optimization efficiency and to produce a solution that is superior to other local tuning methods. In addition, a novel projection-based approach for posynomial fitting is used to facilitate scaling to large problem sizes.

To this end, fundamental circuit design knowledge is described by constraint functions. Based on a linearization of the latter and of the circuit performance functions, a description of the feasible performance range in the form of a polytope is derived. Moreover, the approach is integrated into a hierarchical sizing method, where it propagates topological and technological constraints bottom-up. Practical application results demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the new method.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382693","","Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit topology;Electronic design automation and methodology;Engines;Integrated circuit technology;Nonlinear equations;Space exploration;Space technology","Fourier analysis;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;network topology","Fourier-Motzkin elimination;analog performance space exploration;circuit topology;constraint functions;fundamental circuit design knowledge;hierarchical sizing method;simulation-based exploration;topology selection","","4","","17","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments include mapping of several designs, which are implemented using parameterized CoreGen IP cores, on Xilinx FPGA devices. Different time budgeting policies have been applied during the mapping stage. Our time management techniques always improved the area requirement of the implemented testbenches compared to a widely-used path-based method.

In this paper, we propose a new software approach for estimating di/dt noise and incorporate it into a power simulator in order to investigate the influence of software on substrate noise.

Existing approaches on wire pipelining are mostly based on edge triggered flip-flops. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using level sensitive latches in terms of both latency and area cost. The input-output timing coupling and the strict short path constraint for latches demand additional design elaborations compared with flip-flops. New approaches are proposed in this work to solve these difficulties so that the advantages of latches can be fully utilized. In particular, a deferred delay padding technique is developed to correct short path violations with the minimal extra cost. These techniques are integrated with a dynamic programming based concurrent synchronous element and repeater insertion framework.

However, increasing performance and energy demands faced by application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) are forcing designers to alter the fundamental architectural template of the HLS output, namely, a controller-datapath associated with a memory subsystem (monolithic, banked, etc.). We propose an architectural template for the HLS output that consists of a controller-datapath circuit associated with a memory subsystem into which computation units have been integrated. The enhanced memory subsystem is called computation-unit integrated memory (CIM). A CIM offers higher memory bandwidth (relative to what is offered through the system bus) to computation units present locally within it and reduces the overall communication between the memory subsystem and the controller-datapath, thus providing a template highly suitable for deriving efficient implementations of memory-intensive applications. This work addresses the challenge of providing an automatic synthesis framework for a CIM-based architecture. Our framework can analyze the various trade-offs involved in selecting suitable operations in a behavior for execution using a CIM and generate a high-performance, low-overhead implementation. Experiments with several behaviors indicate that an average performance improvement of 1.88× (a maximum of 2.63×) is possible with very low area overheads. The energy-delay product improves by an average of 2.1× (maximum of 3.4×).","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382682","","Application specific integrated circuits;Automatic control;Bandwidth;Communication system control;Computer integrated manufacturing;Control system synthesis;Control systems;High level synthesis;System buses;Technological innovation","application specific integrated circuits;high level synthesis;integrated memory circuits;logic design","HLS output;application-specific integrated circuits;architectural template;automatic synthesis framework;computation-unit integrated memory;controller-datapath circuit;high-level synthesis;memory bandwidth;memory subsystem","","1","","35","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, we present a new DVFS technique, which considers not only the active power, but also the standby component of the system power. This is in sharp contrast with previous DVFS techniques, which only consider the active power component.

Nonlinear (e.g. quadratic) response surface models can be utilized to capture larger scale process variations; however, such models result in non-normal distributions for circuit performance which are difficult to capture since the distribution model is unknown. In this paper we propose an asymptotic probability extraction method, APEX, for estimating the unknown random distribution when using nonlinear response surface modeling. APEX first uses a binomial moment evaluation to efficiently compute the high order moments of the unknown distribution, and then applies moment matching to approximate the characteristic function of the random circuit performance by an efficient rational function. A simple statistical timing example and an analog circuit example demonstrate that APEX can provide better accuracy than Monte Carlo simulation with 10 samples and achieve orders of magnitude more efficiency. We also show the error incurred by the popular normal modeling assumption using standard IC technologies.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382533","","Circuit optimization;Distributed computing;Gaussian distribution;Integrated circuit modeling;Large-scale systems;Linear regression;Probability distribution;Random variables;Response surface methodology;Timing","estimation theory;normal distribution;probability;random processes;statistical analysis","IC technology generation;Monte Carlo simulation;analog circuit;asymptotic probability extraction method;binomial moment evaluation;high order moments;linear regression models;moment matching;nonlinear response surface modeling;nonnormal distributions;normal distributions;performance variations;process variations;random circuit performance;random distribution;statistical timing","","40","","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also shown that this optimal active shielding architecture depends on the ratio of coupling to ground capacitance (γ = C<sub>c</sub>/C<sub>g</sub>). Optimal active shielding is shown to provide up to 25% reduction in bus power dissipation compared to conventional passive shielding.

ICCAD-2004. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","402","409","Crosstalk noise has become an important issue as technology scales down for timing and signal integrity closure. Existing works to fix crosstalk noise are mostly done at the routing or post routing stage, which may be too late. Since placement determines the overall routing congestion, which correlates with the coupling capacitance, which in turn correlates with the crosstalk noise, placement shall be a good level to do early noise mitigation. The only existing work for the crosstalk aware placement (to our best knowledge) is by Lou and Chen (2004), which uses the coupling capacitance map to guide placement. However, crosstalk is determined not only by the coupling capacitance, but also by many other factors, such as the driver resistance of the victim net and the coupling location (near source vs near sink coupling) (Cong et al., 2001). We introduce a concept of noise map which takes those factors into account. Guided by this accurate noise map explicitly, we propose an incremental placement technique to mitigate noise without disturbing the global placement order. Our incremental placement has two key steps, namely noise aware cell inflation and local refinement. Experimental results on industrial circuits show that our approach is able to reduce the number of top noise nets by 25% and improve the timing (300ps on the worst slack), with no wire length penalty or CPU overhead. Our incremental approach is also able to maintain the placement stability.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382608","","Capacitance;Central Processing Unit;Circuit noise;Crosstalk;Noise level;Noise reduction;Refining;Routing;Timing;Wire","crosstalk;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise","coupling capacitance map;coupling location;crosstalk noise;driver resistance;global placement order;industrial circuits;local refinement;near sink coupling;near source coupling;noise aware cell inflation;noise map;noise mitigation;overall routing congestion;placement stability;true crosstalk aware incremental placement","","7","","26","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key advantages of dynamic reconfiguration are the ability to rapidly adapt to dynamic changes and better utilization of the programmable hardware resources for multiple applications. However, with the advent of multi-million gate equivalent FPGAs, configuration time is increasingly becoming a concern. High reconfiguration cost can potentially wipe out any gains from dynamic reconfiguration. One solution to alleviate this problem is to exploit the high levels of redundancy in the configuration bitstream by compression. In this paper, we propose a novel configuration compression technique that exploits redundancies both within a configuration's bitstream as well as between bitstreams of multiple configurations. By maximizing reuse, our results show that the proposed technique performs 26.5-75.8% better than the previously proposed techniques.

Current noise-aware STA methods compute noise-induced delay uncertainty for each net independently and annotate appropriate delay changes of nets onto data paths and associated clock paths to determine timing violations. Since delay changes in individual nets contribute cumulatively to delay changes of paths, even small amounts of pessimism in noise computation of nets can add up to produce large timing violations for paths, which may be unrealistic. Unlike glitch noise analysis where noise often attenuates during propagation, quality of delay noise analysis is severely affected by any pessimism in noise estimation and can unnecessarily cost valuable silicon and design resources for fixing unreal violations. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce pessimism in noise-aware STA by considering signal correlations of all nets associated with an entire timing path simultaneously, in a path-based approach. We first present an exact algorithm based on the branch-and-bound technique and then extend it with several heuristic techniques so that very large industrial designs can be analyzed efficiently. These techniques, which are implemented in an industrial crosstalk noise analysis tool, show as much as 75% reduction in the computed path delay variations.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382564","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit noise;Crosstalk;Delay estimation;Digital circuits;Logic;Noise reduction;Signal analysis;Timing;Uncertainty","circuit analysis computing;crosstalk;delays;digital circuits;integrated circuit noise;tree searching","branch-and-bound technique;clock paths;crosstalk noise analysis tool;crosstalk-induced delay variation;data paths;delay changes;delay noise analysis;delay noise pessimism reduction;exact algorithm;glitch noise analysis;heuristic techniques;high-performance digital circuits;large industrial designs;logic correlations;noise computation;noise estimation;noise-aware STA methods;noise-induced delay uncertainty;path delay variations;path-based approach;signal correlations;signal integrity problems;state-of-the-art static timing analysis;timing path;timing violations","","7","2","10","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A serializing compiler is a source-to-source translator that takes a POSIX compliant multitasking C program as input and generates an equivalent, embedded processor independent, single-threaded ANSI C program, to be compiled using the embedded processor-specific tool chain. Such serializing compilers work by partitioning each task into blocks of code and synthesizing a scheduler that dynamically switches among these blocks. The quality of the compiled code in terms of multitasking overhead and task latency is highly dependent on the partitioning algorithm. In this work, we give our solution to the partitioning problem in the context of serializing compilers.

Expansion refers to the process during which cells are gradually distributed over a specified region. We implement expansion in a new placer by enhancing a quadratic placement technique based on fixed-point addition originally presented by B. Hu and M. Marek-Sadowska (2003), where fixed points were defined as dimensionless pseudo cells, and were deliberately introduced into the circuit to pull cells from one location to another.

We focus on the high-performance single-layer bus routing problem, where the objective is to match the lengths of all nets belonging to each bus. An effective approach to solve this problem is to allocate extra routing resources around short nets during routing; and use those resources for length extension afterwards. We first propose a provably optimal algorithm for routing nets with min-area max-length constraints. Then, we extend this algorithm to the case where minimum constraints are given as exact length bounds. We also prove that this algorithm is optimal within a constant factor. Both algorithms proposed are also shown to be scalable for large circuits, since the respective time complexities are O(A) and O(A log A), where A is the area of the intermediate region between chips.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382690","","Application software;Circuits;Clocks;Computer industry;Computer science;Frequency;Resource management;Routing;Timing;Wires","circuit optimisation;computational complexity;minimax techniques;network routing;system buses;timing","clock frequencies;exact length bounds;extra routing resource allocation;high-performance bus routing;min-area max-length constraints;net routing;optimal algorithm;single-layer bus routing;time complexities;timing requirements","","8","","18","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, robust algorithms for large-scale placement of such designs have only recently been considered in the literature, and improvements by over 10% per paper are still common. Large macros can be handled by traditional floorplanning, but are harder to account for in min-cut and analytical placement. On the other hand, traditional floorplanning techniques do not scale to large numbers of objects, especially in terms of solution quality. We propose to integrate min-cut placement with fixed-outline floor-planning to solve the more general placement problem, which includes cell placement, floorplanning, mixed-size placement and achieving routability. At every step of min-cut placement, either partitioning or wirelength-driven, fixed-outline floorplanning is invoked. If the latter fails, we undo an earlier partitioning decision, merge adjacent placement regions and re-floorplan the larger region to find a legal placement for the macros. Empirically, this framework improves the scalability and quality of results for traditional wirelength-driven floorplanning. It has been validated on recent designs with embedded memories and accounts for routability. Additionally, we propose that free-shape rectilinear floorplanning can be used with rough module-area estimates before synthesis.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382639","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific integrated circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Large-scale systems;Law;Legal factors;Partitioning algorithms;Robustness;Scalability;Shape","integrated circuit layout;network synthesis","ASIC designs;analog blocks;analytical placement;cell placement;embedded memories;fixed-outline floorplanning;free-shape rectilinear floorplanning;large-scale placement;min-cut placement;mixed-size placement;partitioning;wirelength-driven floorplanning","","49","5","31","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm can be applied in a variety of placement-aware optimization contexts. The second contribution is a specific application of this algorithm to placement-aware common divisor extraction. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed extraction procedure by using it in an otherwise non-placement-aware flow with two different final placers. The first flow uses an industrial congestion-driven placer and results in an average reduction of 21% in congestion as measured by the global router. The second flow uses an academic wire-length-driven placer and results in an average reduction of 11% for a tool-specific measure of congestion estimated from the placement. Our experiments also reveal a rather surprising phenomenon: in many cases the attempt to minimize the wire-length results in fewer literals after extraction than with a conventional literal-driven approach.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382637","","Computer networks;Data mining;Delay;Fluid flow measurement;Joining processes;Logic design;Network synthesis;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wires","logic design;network synthesis;optimisation","academic wire-length-driven placer;congestion-aware divisor extraction;incremental placement algorithm;industrial congestion-driven placer;nonplacement-aware flow;optimum location;placement-aware common divisor extraction;placement-aware logic synthesis;placement-aware optimization","","2","","13","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A heuristic mixed-integer linear programming (MLP) method is also presented which has several advantages: it is faster, its accuracy can be quickly estimated, and trade-offs between runtime and optimality can easily be made. The proposed methods are used to generate a large set of experimental results on leakage reduction. It is shown that average leakage currents are usually 1.25 times the minimum, confirming the effectiveness of IVC. The heuristic MLP approach is much faster than exact ILP, while finding input vectors whose power consumption is only a few percent from the optimum.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382634","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Integer linear programming;Leakage current;Linear programming;Minimization;Runtime;Vectors","Boolean functions;CMOS integrated circuits;integer programming;leakage currents;linear programming;minimisation","heuristic mixed-integer linear programming;input vector control;leakage power minimization;leakage power reduction;optimal integer linear programming model;power consumption;pseudo-Boolean functions;static CMOS circuits","","15","","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it is conceptually understood that a thermal equivalent circuit can be constructed to characterize the temperature gradients across the chip, direct and iterative solutions of the corresponding 3D equations are often intractable for a full-chip analysis. Multigrid accelerated iterative methods can be applied to solve the equivalent circuit problem that is provably symmetric positive definite; however, explicitly building the matrix problem is intractable for most full-chip problems. In This work we present a multigrid iterative approach for the full-chip thermal analysis which does not require explicit construction of the equivalent circuit matrix. We propose specific multigrid treatments to cope with the strong anisotropy of the full-chip thermal problem that is created by the vast difference in material thermal properties and chip geometries. Importantly, we demonstrate that only with careful thermal modeling assumptions and appropriate choices for grid hierarchy, multigrid operators and smoothing steps across grid points, can we accurately and efficiently analyze a full-chip thermal problem. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multigrid methodology.

A lot of effective DVS techniques have addressed either one of the two subproblems, but none of them have attempted to solve both simultaneously, which is mainly due to an excessive computation complexity to solve it optimally. This work addresses this core issue, that is, Can the combined problem be solved effectively and efficiently? More specifically, our work shows, for a set of inter-dependent tasks, that the combined DVS problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. Experimental results indicate that the proposed integrated DVS technique is able to reduce energy consumption by 10.6% on average over the results by (Zhang et al., 2002 and Seo et al., 2004) (i.e., a straightforward combination of two optimal inter- and intra task DVS techniques).","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560110","","Circuits;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Minimization;Polynomials;Real time systems;Timing;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","computation complexity;energy consumption reduction;energy minimization;hard real-time application;inter-task dynamic voltage scaling;intra-task dynamic voltage scaling;optimal integration;polynomial time","","3","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme adopts a two-phase approach, firstly by using a cycle random scan test with a few random seed patterns to test the DUT and secondly, by using the RAS mechanism to test the circuit. Due to employment of a revised process and several strategies, namely, test response abundant, constrained static compaction, and bit propagation before test vector dropping, it is very effective in reducing bit flipping and test data volume, consequently, the test application time and power.

By viewing a wiring segment as an ""atomic object"" of perturbation, we can efficiently evaluate the effect of routing tree perturbation. We propose two complementary routing optimization methods, namely segment partitioning and segment migration. These targeted optimizers can improve congestion related routing objectives by quickly shuffling wiring segments across different routing channels. Our routing approach produces better results compared to rip-up and re-route method based router Labyrinth (R.

This paper addresses this device-level placement problem for analog circuits and our approach can handle symmetry constraint and other placement constraints simultaneously. The problem of placing devices with symmetry constraint has been extensively studied but none of the previous works has considered symmetry constraint with other placement constraints simultaneously. Instead of handling the constraints by having a penalty term in the cost function to penalize violations, a unified method is proposed that, by adjusting the edge weights in a pair of constraint graphs, can try to satisfy all the placement and symmetry constraints simultaneously in a candidate floorplan solution. The maximum distance of the modules in a symmetry group from the corresponding symmetry axis will be minimized in this weight adjusting step, in order to minimize the total packing area. We have compared our method with the most updated results on this problem (Balasa et al., 2004) when there are only symmetry constraints and results show that our approach can give solutions of better quality, in an acceptable amount of run time. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling different types of constraints simultaneously by testing on data sets with both symmetry and other placement constraints, and the results are very promising","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110197","","Analog circuits;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Cost function;Engines;Simulated annealing;Thermal degradation;Upper bound;Voltage","analogue circuits;circuit layout;constraint handling","analog circuits;analog placement;candidate floorplan solution;constraints handling;device matching","","13","2","14","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
