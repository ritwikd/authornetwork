"New decompilation techniques for binary-level co-processor generation","Stiff, G.; Vahid, F.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., California Univ., Riverside, CA, USA","Computer-Aided Design, 2005.

However, existing approaches place restrictions on software languages and compilers. Binary-level co-processor generation has previously been proposed as a complementary approach to reduce impact on tool restrictions, supporting all languages and compilers, at the cost of some decrease in performance. In a binary-level approach, decompilation recovers much of the high-level information, like loops and arrays, needed for effective synthesis, and in many cases yields hardware similar to that of a compiler-based approach. However, previous binary-level approaches have not considered the effects of software compiler optimizations on the resulting hardware. In this paper, we introduce two new decompilation techniques, strength promotion and loop rerolling, and show that they are necessary to synthesize an efficient custom hardware coprocessor from a binary in the presence of software compiler optimizations. In addition, unlike previous approaches, we show the robustness of binary-level co-processor generation by achieving order of magnitude speedups for binaries generated for three different instruction sets, MIPS, ARM, and MicroBlaze, using two different levels of compiler optimizations.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560127","","Application software;Application specific processors;Coprocessors;Costs;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Microprocessors;Optimizing compilers;Software performance","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;logic design;microprocessor chips","ARM;MIPS;MicroBlaze;application-specific instruction-set processor;binary-level approach;binary-level co-processor generation;compiler-based co-processor synthesis;decompilation technique;high-level information;high-performance gigahertz microprocessors;loop rerolling;software compiler optimization;software language;tool restrictions","","3","","16","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fast and efficient phase conflict detection and correction in standard-cell layouts","Chiang, C.; Kahng, A.B.; Sinha, S.; Xu, X.","Adv. Technol.

This technology imposes additional constraints on the layouts beyond traditional design rules. Of particular note is the requirement that all critical features be flanked by opposite-phase shifters, while the shifters obey minimum width and spacing requirements. A layout is called phase-assignable if it satisfies this requirement. Phase conflicts between shifters have to be removed to enable the use of AAPSM for layouts that air not phase-assignable. Previous work has sought to detect a suitable set of phase conflicts to be removed, as well as correct them as well as correct them. This paper has two key contributions: (1) a new computationally efficient approach to detect a minimal set of phase conflicts, which when corrected produces a phase-assignable layout; (2) a novel layout modification scheme for correcting these phase conflicts in standard-cell blocks. Unlike previous formulations of this problem, the proposed solution for the conflict detection problem does not frame it as a graph bipartization problem. Instead, a simpler and more computationally efficient reduction is proposed. This simplification greatly improves the runtime, while maintaining the same improvements ill the quality of results. An average runtime speedup of 5.9× is achieved using the new flow. A new layout modification scheme for correcting phase conflicts in large standard-cell blocks is also proposed. The proposed layout modification scheme can handle all phase conflicts in large standard-cell blocks with small increases in area. Our experiments show that the percentage area increase for making typical standard-cell blocks phase-assignable ranges from 3.4-9.1%.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560055","","Image resolution;Interference;Lithography;Manufacturing processes;Phase detection;Phase modulation;Phase shifters;Printing;Runtime;Shape","graph theory;integrated circuit layout;phase shifting masks;photolithography","alternating-aperture phase shift masking;critical feature imaging;opposite-phase shifters;phase conflict correction;phase conflict detection;phase-assignable layout;resolution enhancement technology;standard-cell blocks;standard-cell layout","","10","3","13","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Convexity is often ensured by fitting the table data into analytically convex forms such as posynomials. However, fitting the look-up tables into the posynomial forms with minimum error itself may not be a convex optimization problem and hence excessive fitting errors may be introduced. In this paper, we propose to directly adjust the look-up table values into a numerically convex look-up table without explicit analytical form. We show that numerically ""convexifying"" the table data with minimum perturbation can be formulated as a convex semidefinite optimization problem and hence optimality can be reached in polynomial time. Without an explicit form limitation, we find that the fitting error is significantly reduced while the convexity is still ensured. As a result, convex optimization algorithms can still be applied. Furthermore, we also develop a ""smoothing"" algorithm to make the table data smooth and convex to facilitate the optimization process. Results from extensive experiments on industrial cell libraries demonstrate that our method reduces 30× fitting error over a well-developed posynomial fitting algorithm. Its application to circuit tuning is also presented.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560063","","Application software;Circuit optimization;Delay;Drives;Fitting;Libraries;Polynomials;Smoothing methods;Table lookup;Very large scale integration","circuit optimisation;convex programming;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;table lookup","circuit tuning;convex optimization algorithms;convex semidefinite optimization problem;gate-sizing;industrial cell libraries;look-up tables;minimum-error convex fitting;numerical convex;posynomial fitting algorithm;smoothing algorithm;table data","","8","","16","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the various types of DG devices, quasi-planar SOI FinFETs are easier to manufacture compared to planar double-gate devices. DG devices with independent gates (separate contacts to back and front gates) have recently been developed. DG devices with symmetric and asymmetric gates have also been demonstrated. Such device options have direct implications at the circuit level. Independent control of front and back gate in DG devices can be effectively used to improve performance and reduce power in sub-50nm circuits. Independent gate control can be used to merge parallel transistors in noncritical paths. This results in reduction in the effective switching capacitance and hence power dissipation. We show a variety of circuits in logic and memory that can benefit from independent gate operation of DG devices. As examples, we show the benefit of independent gate operation in circuits such as dynamic logic circuits, Schmitt triggers, sense amplifiers, and SRAM cells. In addition to independent gate option, we also investigate the usefulness of asymmetric devices and the impact of width quantization and process variations on circuit design.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560067","","Capacitance;FinFETs;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Manufacturing;Nanoscale devices;Operational amplifiers;Power dissipation;Scalability;Trigger circuits","MOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;silicon-on-insulator","asymmetric gates;circuit design;double-gate SOI devices;double-gate devices;double-gate transistors;independent gate control;independent gate operation;nano-scale circuits;noncritical paths;parallel transistors;power dissipation;process variations;quasi-planar SOI FinFET;switching capacitance;symmetric gates;width quantization","","8","3","32","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of buffer insertion in a single net has been the focus of most previous researches. However, efficient algorithms for buffer insertion in whole circuits are generally needed. In this paper, we relate the timing constrained minimal buffer insertion problem to the min-cost flow dual problem, and propose two algorithms based on min-cost flow and min-cut techniques, respectively, to solve it in combinational circuits. We compare our approaches to a traditional approach based on Lagrangian relaxation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approaches are efficient and effective. On the average, our approaches achieve 45% and 39% reduction, respectively, on the number of buffers inserted in comparison to the traditional approach.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560087","","Combinational circuits;Constraint theory;Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;Intelligent networks;Iterative algorithms;Lagrangian functions;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wires","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;combinational circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","Lagrangian relaxation;buffer insertion techniques;combinational circuits;min-cost flow techniques;min-cut techniques;network flow","","5","","22","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the prior compiler techniques try to optimize data locality in a one-dimensional linear address space. However, there are many problems out there where the domain for data locality can be two or higher dimensional. For example, in a 2D mesh network environment, each node has connections with its four neighbors, and therefore, the data locality can potentially be exploited in two dimensions from a given processor's viewpoint. Because of this, maximizing the number of communications with any of four neighbors (instead of other nodes) helps improve performance. Similar examples can be given from the areas of embedded sensor processing and 3D systems as well. In this application domain, we make two specific contributions. First, we show how array data of a loop-intensive application can be mapped onto a 2D mesh so that the communication distances between the nodes are reduced. Second, we discuss how code restructuring through loop transformation can help us achieve better data locality in the 2D space.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560077","","Application software;Circuits;Computer science;Concrete;Data engineering;Data structures;Mesh networks;Optimizing compilers;Programming profession;Sensor systems","memory architecture;storage management","2D data locality;2D mesh;code restructuring;compiler optimization;compiler techniques;embedded sensor processing;linear address space;loop transformation;loop-intensive application","","1","","18","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new mapper aimed at mitigating structural bias. It is based on a simplified cut-based Boolean matching algorithm, and using the speed afforded by this simplification we explore two ideas to reduce structural bias. The first, called lossless synthesis, leverages recent advances in structure-based combinational equivalence checking to combine the different networks seen during technology independent synthesis into a single network with choices in a scalable manner. We show how cut based mapping extends naturally to handle such networks with choices. The second idea is to combine several library gates into a single gate (called a supergate) in order to make the matching process less local. We show how supergates help address the structural bias problem, and how they fit naturally into the cut-based Boolean matching scheme. An implementation based on these ideas significantly outperforms state-of-the-art mappers in terms of delay, area and run-time on academic and industrial benchmarks.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560122","","Boolean functions;Delay;Electrical capacitance tomography;Libraries;Logic;Network synthesis;Proposals;Runtime","Boolean functions;logic design;logic gates;logic simulation","combinational equivalence;cut-based Boolean matching;cut-based mapping;library gates;lossless synthesis;structural bias reduction;technology mapping","","20","3","22","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the proposed reshaping algorithm, response shapers can help the space compactor to reduce the number of undetectable modeled and unmodeled faults in the presence of unknown values. Moreover, the proposed compaction scheme is ATPG-independent and its hardware requirement is pattern-independent. In our experiments, we use a simple XOR compactor as the space compactor to evaluate the effectiveness of the response shaper. The results show that the number of undetectable faults and unobservable scan-out responses can be significantly reduced in comparison with the results of a convolutional compactor. The number of the extra scan-in bits required for the control signals of the response shapers is only a small fraction of the total test data volume. Also, its hardware overhead is acceptable and the runtime of the reshaping algorithm is scalable for large industrial designs.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560044","","Automatic testing;Chaos;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Compaction;Convolution;Design for testability;Hardware;National electric code;Shape control","boundary scan testing;circuit reliability;fault tolerance;logic circuits;logic design;logic gates","XOR compactors;circuit modules;output response compaction;response shaper;scan-out responses;space compactors","","21","1","16","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we overcome these shortcomings and make the link based non-tree approach feasible for realistic designs. The short circuit risk and multi-driver delay issues in buffered non-tree clock networks are investigated. Our approach is validated with SPICE based Monte Carlo simulations, considering spatial correlations among variations.

Experiments show that our models are within 3% from Monte Carlo simulation, and the leakage and delay variations can be up to 3× and 1.9×, respectively. We then derive analytical yield models considering both leakage and timing variations, and use such models to evaluate FPGA device and architecture under process variations. Compared to the architecture similar to a commercial FPGA and device setting from ITRS roadmap, device tuning alone improves leakage yield by 39% and architecture and device co-optimization increases leakage yield by 73%.

Our theoretical results were verified through a simulation study and comparison to experimental data collected from a 400 MHz phase-locked loop supplied by an industry sponsor.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560047","","Built-in self-test;Clocks;Frequency measurement;Gaussian distribution;Jitter;Measurement techniques;Phase locked loops;System performance;System testing;Time measurement","Gaussian distribution;automatic testing;built-in self test;circuit testing;jitter;phase locked loops","400 MHz;BIST jitter measurement;Gaussian distribution estimation;built-in-self-test;phase-locked loops","","2","","8","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Custom NoC design in nanoscale technologies must address performance requirements, power consumption and physical layout considerations.

Techniques like wire pipelining and retiming can manage delay of timing critical wires. The latency of the system, however, limits the total pipelining in the design. New techniques are, thus, needed at synthesis stage to consider the effect of critical wires in the design. In this work, we propose a novel intuitive algorithm, critical edge reduction (CER) algorithm, which produces a maximal delay budgeting solution under fixed latency while minimizing the number of critical wires. We also present an in-depth analysis of trade-off between maximum budgeting and critical edge minimization. We implemented our design flow using a set of MediaBench data paths on Xilinx VirtexE FPGA devices. Using our algorithm, the Xilinx Place and Route tool achieved timing closure, on average, 2.8 times faster than using maximum budgeting. The resulting average clock period using CER algorithm outperforms the one using maximum budgeting by 6%.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560171","","Chip scale packaging;Clocks;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Logic gates;Pipeline processing;Routing;Timing;Wire","delays;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;timing","MediaBench data paths;Xilinx Place;Xilinx VirtexE FPGA devices;clock frequency;critical edge minimization;critical edge reduction algorithm;deep sub-micron designs;delay relaxation;design flow;interconnect criticality;interconnect delay;maximum budgeting;retiming;timing closure;total pipelining;transistor sizes;wire pipelining","","3","1","13","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 50% delay and rise time are determined with much more accuracy for a given approximation order. Moreover, the solutions have significantly improved accuracy as compared to AWE, especially for moderate to highly inductive signals.

Unfortunately, the use of an N-phase design style will increase the number of state variables by a factor of N, making formal verification many orders of magnitude harder. Previous approaches to solving this problem restrict the kind of designs that can be handled severely and construct an abstracted netlist with fewer state variables by a syntactic analysis that requires the user to identify clocks. We extend the current state of the art by introducing a phase abstraction algorithm that (1) poses no restrictions on the design style that can be used, that (2) avoids an error prone syntactic analysis, that (3) requires no input from users, and that (4) can be integrated into any model checker without requiring HDL code analysis.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560220","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic control;Circuit optimization;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Error analysis;Formal verification;Hardware design languages;Latches;Logic design","circuit complexity;clocks;combinational circuits;formal verification","HDL code analysis;N-phase design style;clocks;combinational logic;formal verification;model checking;phase abstraction algorithm;syntactic analysis","","15","3","14","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PROBE applies a novel projection scheme to reduce the response surface modeling cost (i.e., both the required number of samples and the linear equation size) and make the modeling problem tractable even for large problem sizes. In addition, a new implicit power iteration algorithm is developed to find the optimal projection space and solve for the unknown model coefficients. Several circuit examples from both digital and analog circuit modeling applications demonstrate that PROBE can generate accurate response surface models while achieving up to 12× speedup compared with the traditional methods.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560160","","Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Equations;Fluctuations;Integrated circuit modeling;Large-scale systems;Probes;Response surface methodology;Surface fitting","circuit simulation;integrated circuit technology;nanotechnology;network synthesis;response surface methodology","analog circuit modeling;circuit performance variation;digital circuit modeling;interdie variation;intradie variation;large scale process fluctuation;nanoscale IC technology;optimal projection space;performance modeling;power iteration algorithm;projection-based extraction;response surface modeling cost","","17","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This results in unwanted glitch propagation along the LUTs, and wastes power. This paper proposes a flip-flop insertion, we propose insertion of new flip-flops between adjacent existing flip-flops to minimize glitch propagation and power loss. Each new flip-flop is timed by a phase-shifted clock with the phase calculated from the delays of LUTs and routing paths. This is different from traditional retiming methods that use the original clock or an 180-degree clock for the new flip-flops, and thus alters the original pipeline structure and synchronization. We start from a post-layout design, retiming its clock frequency and timing behavior. Multiple flip-flop insertion is an NP-complete problem because each new flip-flop affects the delays in the design. We have devised a glitch generation and propagation model for LUT-based FPGAs that take account of path delays while supporting reasonable complexity. We propose effective heuristics for flip-flop insertion and clock phase selection. Full-chip measurements, including all the overheads associated with the inserted flip-flops, show that our approach shows up to 38% of the total dynamic power. We have analyzed our scheme, showing the mechanics of clock assignment and glitch minimization, and the sources of power reduction.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560090","","Clocks;Delay;Design optimization;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Frequency synchronization;Pipelines;Propagation losses;Routing;Table lookup","clocks;field programmable gate arrays;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;logic design;table lookup","FPGA power reduction;NP-complete problem;clock assignment;clock frequency;clock phase selection;field programmable gate array;flip-flop insertion;full-chip measurements;glitch generation;glitch minimization;glitch propagation;look-up table size;phase-shifted clock;pipeline structure;propagation model;retiming methods;routing paths;shifted-phase clocks","","2","","15","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Circuit simulation for all the combinations of process-voltage-temperature (PVT) conditions, known as PVT simulation, is emerging as a must not only for analog and RF circuit designs, but also for the designs of digital library cells and critical paths. With the number of PVT conditions in the range of hundreds and even thousands, existing solution of invoking a simulator repeatedly for all these PVT conditions is becoming extremely time consuming. This paper presents a new simulation approach capable of simulating hundreds and thousands PVT corners with the computational cost comparable to or even less than that of a few corner simulations, yet with the same simulation accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach is based on the combination of the LU-factorization based direct method and Krylov subspace based iterative methods to explore the common characteristics shared by a circuit under all PVT corners. The key novelty is a systematic method that uses as few LU based direct solving as possible for underlying linearized systems, and then solves the rest of linearized systems across the entire PVT linear system space using Krylov subspace based iterative methods with preconditioners computed from those LU factors.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560118","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Iterative methods;Power supplies;Radio frequency;Software libraries;Temperature;Voltage","circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;iterative methods","Krylov subspace based iterative method;LU-factorization based direct method;PVT simulation;RF circuit design;analog circuit;circuit simulation;deep-submicron integrated circuit;digital library cell;process-voltage-temperature condition","","2","3","9","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20051219","2005","","","954","961","High performance circuits are facing increasingly severe signal integrity problems due to crosstalk noise and crosstalk noise awareness has become an integral part of static timing analysis (STA). Existing crosstalk noise aware STA methods compute noise induced delay uncertainty on a net by net basis and in a pessimistic way, without considering the overlap bounds of the victim and aggressor timing windows and realistic delay impact on early and late signal arrival times. Since crosstalk induced delay on individual nets contribute cumulatively on data and clock paths, even small amounts of pessimism in computation can add up to produce several unrealistic timing violations. Unlike glitch noise analysis where noise often attenuates during propagation, quality of delay noise analysis is severely affected by any pessimism in noise estimation and can unnecessarily cost valuable silicon and design resources for fixing unreal violations. In this paper, we propose two temporal techniques to reduce pessimism in crosstalk noise aware STA. The first method, ""effective delay noise"", is a net based method where the exact overlap points of victim and aggressor timing windows are considered to obtain the part of delay noise that actually impacts early and late signal arrival times. The second method, ""path based delay noise"", is a path based method where the reduced arrival uncertainty of the nets of a given path are utilized for pessimism reduction. We also propose a novel ""uncertainty propagation"" technique as part of the second method, which results in an iteration free crosstalk noise aware STA of the path with significantly reduced pessimism. The two techniques are combined in a proposed methodology that is compatible with existing industrial static timing analyzers with very little computational overhead compared to the traditional noise aware STA and a significant improvement in eliminating unreal violations. The proposed techniques resulted in 77% reduction of worst case negative slack and 57% reduction in the number of failing paths in the setup analysis of a 90nm industrial design.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560199","","Circuit noise;Clocks;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Performance analysis;Propagation delay;Signal analysis;Timing;Uncertainty","clocks;crosstalk;delays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise","aggressor timing window;clock path;crosstalk noise aware STA method;data path;delay noise analysis;early signal arrival time;effective delay noise;glitch noise analysis;late signal arrival time;noise induced delay uncertainty;path based delay noise;pessimism reduction;signal integrity;static timing analysis;victim timing window","","6","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To fix a design problem, one would like to perturb the design as little as possible while preserving the integrity of the original placement. This work presents a novel computational geometry based placement migration method, and a new stability metric to more accurately measure the ""similarity"" between two placements. It has two stages, a bin-based spreading at coarse scale and a Delaunay triangulation based spreading at finer grain. It has clear advantage over conventional legalization algorithms such that the neighborhood characteristics of the original placement are preserved. Thus, the placement migration is much more stable, which is important to maintain. Applying this technique to placement legalization demonstrates significant improvements in wire length and stability compared to other popular legalization algorithms.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560038","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit stability;Circuit synthesis;Computational geometry;Dynamic programming;Routing;Signal design;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wire","circuit CAD;circuit layout CAD;computational geometry;mesh generation;network routing","Delaunay triangulation;bin-based spreading;computational geometry;conventional legalization algorithms;heat distribution;placement migration method;post-placement design;routing congestion;signal integrity;timing congestion","","7","5","15","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For wrapper synthesis, we have developed an automated tool which accepts interface specifications in a high-level language (Component Wrapper Language, or CWL), and automatically produces gate-level implementations of wrapper circuitry that will correctly and efficiently stall the synchronous modules depending on the availability of I/O channels. An optimization is introduced to reduce the cost of the wrapper circuitry by eliminating ""busy waiting.""

In comparison, not much attention has been paid to the detailed placement problem. Existing detailed placers either fail to improve upon the excellent solution quality enabled by good global placers or are very slow. To handle the above problems, we focus on the detailed placement problem. We present an efficient and effective detailed placement algorithm to handle the wirelength minimization problem. The main contributions of our work are: (1) an efficient Global Swap technique to identify a pair of cells that can be swapped to reduce wirelength; (2) a flow that combines the Global Swap technique with other heuristics to produce very good wirelength; (3) an efficient single-segment clustering technique to optimally shift cells within a segment to minimize wirelength. On legalized mPL5 global placements on the IBM standard-cell benchmarks, our detailed placer can achieve 19.0%, 13.2% and 0.5% more wirelength reduction compared to Fengshui5.0, rowironing and Domino respectively. Correspondingly we are 3.6× 2.8× and 15× faster.

This provides a general framework for quantifying a designer's preferences for tradeoffs between leakage and delay. We show that energy-delay product (EDP) is an element of a larger class of such utility functions.

We show that for small meshes, our scheme comes within 1% of the SPICE simulation of the complete mesh with respect to clock latency. Our scheme is ideally suited for distributed- or grid-computing.

Both correlated and uncorrelated process parameters are considered by using a first-order linear delay model with fitted process sensitivities. The fitted sensitivities are verified to be accurate with circuit simulations. Statistical information in the form of criticality probabilities are used to actively guide the optimization process which reduces run-time and improves area and performance.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20051219","2005","","","439","445","Batteries are non-ideal energy sources - minimizing the energy consumption of a battery-powered system is not equivalent to maximizing its battery life. We propose an alternative interpretation of a previously proposed battery model, which indicates that the deviation from ideal behavior is due to the buildup of ""unavailable charge"" during the discharge process. Previously, battery-aware task scheduling algorithms and power management policies have been developed, which try to reduce the unavailable charge at the end of a given workload. However, they do not account for the occurrence of rest periods (user enforced, naturally occurring, or due to finite load horizon), which are present in a variety of workloads. We first obtain an analytical bound on the recovery time of a battery as a function of the extent of recovery. Then, we shown that the effect of the rest periods is to reduce the improvement of battery-charge optimizing techniques over traditional energy-optimizing techniques. Under certain conditions, the policy that only minimizes energy consumption can actually achieve a longer battery lifetime than a battery-aware policy. A formal criterion based on the recovery time is proposed to choose between a candidate battery-aware policy and a candidate energy-aware policy. We also model the battery discharge process as a linear time invariant system and obtain the frequency response of a battery. This is then used to study the effect of task granularity on the improvement achieved by battery-aware task scheduling. It was observed that the response time of typical batteries are of the order of seconds to several minutes. This, along with the charge recovery effect, was seen to cause battery-aware task scheduling methods to become ineffective for both very fine-grained (less than 10 ms) and very coarse-grained (greater than 30 mm) task granularities.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560108","","Battery management systems;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy management;Fault location;Frequency response;Power system management;Power system modeling;Scheduling algorithm;Time invariant systems","battery management systems;secondary cells","battery life;battery model;battery optimization;battery recovery time;battery-aware policy;battery-aware task scheduling algorithms;battery-charge optimizing techniques;battery-powered system;charge recovery effect;discharge process;frequency response;linear time invariant system;power management policies;response time;task granularity","","16","","15","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We further show that this sampling-based parametric analysis can be extended from the first order sensitivity analysis to a more accurate second order analysis. By exploiting the natural spatial locality inherent in our algorithm formulation, the second order parametric analysis can be conducted very efficiently even for a large number of global and local variation sources. The proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing large power grids under the influence of process and current loading variations to which the application of the standard brutal-force circuit simulation becomes completely infeasible.

One effective way of reducing circuit temperature is to introduce thermal through-the-silicon (TTS) vias. In this paper, we extended the TTS-via planning in a multilevel routing framework by Cong and Zhang (2005), but use a much enhanced TTS-via planning algorithm. We formulate the TTS-via minimization problem with temperature constraints as a constrained nonlinear programming problem (NLP) based on the thermal resistive model and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm, named m-ADVP, which solves a sequence of simplified via planning subproblems in alternating direction in a multilevel framework. The vertical via distribution is formulated as a convex programming problem, and the horizontal via planning is based on two efficient techniques: path counting and heat propagation. Experimental results show that the m-ADVP algorithm is more than 200× faster than the direct solution to the NPL formulation for via planning with very similar solution quality (within 1% of TS-vias count). However, compared to a recent work of multilevel TS-via planning algorithm based on temperature profiling (Cong and Zhang, 2005), our algorithm can reduce the total TS-via number by over 68% for the same required temperature with similar runtime.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560164","","Computer science;Cooling;Heat sinks;Optimization methods;Resistance heating;Routing;Speech synthesis;Temperature;Thermal conductivity;Three-dimensional integrated circuits","circuit layout;circuit optimisation;convex programming;integrated circuit design;nonlinear programming;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging)","3D IC;circuit temperature;constrained nonlinear programming problem;convex programming;heat dissipation;heat propagation;m-ADVP;multilevel routing framework;path counting;thermal resistive model;thermal through-the-silicon vias;thermal via planning","","36","","20","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a technique for wirelength minimization based on in-place flipping of cells that can be applied to any floorplan style consisting of rectangular blocks or sub-blocks. Instead of conventional search procedures, a Boolean symbolic approach is proposed to generate flip-optimal floorplans. Experimental results show that it can effectively reduce the wirelength of current state of the art approaches, at no cost in area and with modest runtimes.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560041","","Art;Costs;Genetic algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Runtime;Simulated annealing","Boolean functions;binary decision diagrams;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;logic CAD;wiring","Boolean symbolic approach;area layout;flip-optimal floorplan;floorplanning process;in-place cell flipping;optimal block orientation;rectangular cells;wirelength minimization;wirelength optimization","","1","","23","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20051219","2005","","","456","460","Reducing power consumption of communication networks is an important optimization goal in many application domains, ranging from large-scale simulation codes to embedded multi-media applications. Most of the prior efforts on network power optimization are hardware-based schemes. These schemes are predictive by definition as they control communication link status based on the observations made In the past. Since prediction may not be very accurate most of the time, these approaches can result in overheads in terms of both performance and power. This paper proposes a compiler driven approach to communication link voltage management. In this approach, an optimizing compiler analyzes the application code and extracts the data communication pattern among parallel processors. This information along with network topology is used for identifying the link access patterns. These patterns and the inherent data dependence information of the underlying code help the compiler decide the optimum voltages/frequencies to be used for communication links at a given time frame. Our focus in this work is on loop-intensive codes which frequently appear in data intensive video and image processing. We exploit the regularity in data accesses of these codes to abstract out their inter-processor communication patterns, which In turn enable us select the most appropriate voltage/frequency level to employ for each communication link at any time.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560111","","Communication networks;Communication system control;Data mining;Energy consumption;Frequency;Large-scale systems;Multimedia communication;Optimizing compilers;Pattern analysis;Voltage","computer networks;data communication;telecommunication links","application code;communication link voltage management;compiler-directed voltage scaling;data access;data communication pattern;data extraction;data intensive video processing;image processing;inherent data dependence;inter-processor communication pattern;link access pattern;loop-intensive code;network power optimization;network topology;parallel processor;power consumption reduction","","5","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Macromodels for the feasible regions were built hierarchically until the desired accuracy was achieved. An accuracy driven synthesis methodology is proposed to guide the identification of the feasible regions and dynamically enhance the performance of the macromodels. Dynamic performance modeling ensures true convergence of our synthesis approach as opposed to existing static macromodel based techniques.

According to the granularity of units to which voltage scaling is applied, the DVS problem can be divided into two subproblems: (i) inter-task DVS problem; and (ii) intra-task DVS problem. A lot of effective DVS techniques have addressed either one of the two subproblems, but none of them have attempted to solve both simultaneously, which is mainly due to an excessive computation complexity to solve it optimally. This work addresses this core issue, that is, Can the combined problem be solved effectively and efficiently? More specifically, our work shows, for a set of inter-dependent tasks, that the combined DVS problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. Experimental results indicate that the proposed integrated DVS technique is able to reduce energy consumption by 10.6% on average over the results by (Zhang et al., 2002 and Seo et al., 2004) (i.e., a straightforward combination of two optimal inter- and intra task DVS techniques).","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560110","","Circuits;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Minimization;Polynomials;Real time systems;Timing;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","computation complexity;energy consumption reduction;energy minimization;hard real-time application;inter-task dynamic voltage scaling;intra-task dynamic voltage scaling;optimal integration;polynomial time","","3","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper (Li et al., 2005) we demonstrate why the traditional concepts of slack and critical path become ineffective under large-scale variations, and we propose a novel sensitivity-based metric to assess the ""criticality"" of each path and/or arc in the statistical timing graph. We define the statistical sensitivities for both paths and arcs, and theoretically prove that our path sensitivity is equivalent to the probability that a path is critical, and our arc sensitivity is equivalent to the probability that an arc sits on the critical path. An efficient algorithm with incremental analysis capability is described for fast sensitivity computation that has a linear runtime complexity in circuit size.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20051219","2005","","","159","164","We present in this paper, a new interconnect-driven multilevel floorplanning, called IMF, to handle large-scale building-module designs. Unlike the traditional multilevel framework that adopts the ""V-cycle"" framework: bottom-up coarsening followed by top-down uncoarsening, in contrast, IMF works in the ""Λ-cycle"" manner: top-down uncoarsening (partitioning) followed by bottom-up coarsening (merging). The top-down partitioning stage iteratively partitions the floorplan region based on mm-cut bipartitioning with exact net-weight modeling to reduce the number of global interconnections and thus the total wirelength. Then, the bottom-up merging stage iteratively applies fixed-outline floorplanning using simulated annealing for all regions and merges two neighboring regions recursively. We also propose an accelerative fixed-outline floorplanning (AFF) to speed up wirelength minimization under the outline constraint. Experimental results show that IMF consistently obtains the best floorplanning results with the smallest wirelength for large-scale building-module designs, compared with all publicly available floorplanners. In particular, IMF scales very well as the circuit size increases. The Λ-cycle multilevel framework outperforms the V-cycle one in the optimization of global circuit effects, such as interconnection and crosstalk optimization, since the Λ-cycle framework considers the global configuration first and then processes down to local ones level by level and thus the global effects can be handled at earlier stages. The Λ-cycle multilevel framework is general and thus can be readily applied to other problems.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560057","","Chip scale packaging;Clustering algorithms;Design engineering;Integrated circuit interconnections;Large-scale systems;Law;Legal factors;Merging;Simulated annealing;Transistors","circuit optimisation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout","Λ-cycle multilevel framework;bottom-up coarsening;crosstalk optimization;exact net-weight modeling;fixed-outline floorplanning;global circuit effects;global interconnections;interconnect-driven multilevel floorplanning;interconnection optimization;iterative partitioning;large-scale building-module designs;top-down partitioning stage;top-down uncoarsening;wirelength minimization","","23","2","38","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our new algorithm is motivated by the fact that VLSI interconnect circuits have many similar terminals in terms of their timing and delay metrics due to their closeness in structure or due to mathematic approximation using meshing in finite difference or finite element scheme during the extraction process. By allowing some delay tolerance or variations, we can reduce many similar terminals and keep a small number of representative terminals. After terminal reduction, traditional model order reduction methods can achieve more compact models and improve simulation efficiency. The new method, TermMerg, is based on the moments of the circuits as the metrics for the timing or delay. It then employs singular value decomposition (SVD) method to determine the optimum number of clusters based on the low-rank approximation. After this, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the moments of the terminals into different clusters. Experimental results on a number of real industry interconnect circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560176","","Approximation algorithms;Circuit simulation;Delay;Finite difference methods;Finite element methods;Integrated circuit interconnections;Mathematics;Singular value decomposition;Timing;Very large scale integration","delays;finite difference methods;finite element analysis;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;singular value decomposition;timing","K-means clustering algorithm;VLSI interconnect circuits;delay metrics;delay tolerance;delay variations;extraction process;finite difference scheme;finite element scheme;linear interconnect circuits;low-rank approximation;model order reduction methods;singular value decomposition method;terminal reduction;timing metrics","","11","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach centers around a novel, general equation formulation for circuits that we term the GeMPDE. A key feature of our approach is to solve for bivariate frequency variables with the help of novel augmenting phase condition equations. Our GeMPDE-based small-signal analysis provides both amplitude and frequency characteristics in a unified manner and is applicable to any kind of oscillator described by differential equations. We obtain speedups of 1-2 orders of magnitude over the transient simulation approach commonly used today by designers for oscillator perturbation analysis.

Therefore the desired frequency of the voltage (current) controlled oscillator is known but not the controlling voltage (current). We formulate this problem as the solution of an appropriate nonlinear equation. We present robust and efficient numerical techniques for solving this nonlinear equation both in time and frequency domain. We demonstrate using experimental results that this technique is at par with classical methods of calculating oscillator steady-state and period of oscillation for a given control voltage.

This trend is mainly due to the traditional RF testing schemes based on the full measurement of specifications over a wide range of input conditions. In this paper, we present a test development methodology for RF circuits based on a novel parametric fault definition. We target deviations in physical circuit parameters, such as a resistance or the width of a transistor. However, we consider a circuit faulty only if it violates a specification. Our test development method aims at reducing not only the number of measurements, but also the overall test hardware cost by incorporating the relative set-up cost of each measurement into our selection criteria. Experimental results on a low-noise amplifier (LNA) circuit show that our test development technique reduces the overall test time (49%-67%) as well as the number of required measurement set-ups (17%-33%) considerably. By defining the target faults based on specification violations, our technique also provides high confidence in the test quality.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560043","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Electrical resistance measurement;Fault location;Hardware;Low-noise amplifiers;Radio frequency;System testing;Time measurement","circuit testing;fault diagnosis;low noise amplifiers","17 to 33 percent;49 to 67 percent;RF circuit testing;fault location;low-noise amplifier circuit;parametric fault definition;parametric test development;physical circuit parameters;test hardware cost reduction;transistor width","","3","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Combinational loops breach design methodologies, because they can involve undesirable circuit behavior and can possibly lead to oscillations based on the external stimuli to the loops. However, for designs compiled using automated synthesis-compiler, these loops are very likely to appear in the generated gate-level designs. We present a modeling of combinational loops as state holding elements and break non oscillatory loops using a level sensitive latch. Apart from modeling combinational loops consisting of gates, the algorithm also converts the loops through design latches. The increase in design area, due to the loop conversion, has an upper bound of twice the size of the original feedback path. However, in case of multiply nested feedback paths, each path is treated separately. Unlike previous work that converts cyclic combinational logic where the feedback is not exercised, this paper presents an algorithm to identify the stateful ""latch"" behavior in a class of feedback logic (non-oscillatory, monotonic). A conversion algorithm replaces such feedback logic by an equivalent circuit comprising explicit latches and acyclic combinational logic. The replacement circuit has an identical behavior as the original stateful feedback logic.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560091","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Combinational circuits;Design methodology;Equivalent circuits;Feedback loop;Latches;Logic;State feedback;Upper bound","circuit feedback;combinational circuits;equivalent circuits;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic design","acyclic circuit;acyclic combinational logic;acyclic model;automated synthesis-compiler;equivalent circuit;feedback logic;feedback path;gate-level combinational loop;gate-level designs;latch behavior;level sensitive latch;loop conversion;nonoscillatory loops;replacement circuit","","1","","8","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a methodology on top of a set of algorithms to exploit non-trivial voltage island boundaries for optimal power versus design cost trade-off under performance requirement. Our algorithms are efficient, robust and error-bounded, and can be flexibly tuned to optimize for various design objectives (e.g., minimal power within a given number of voltage islands, or minimal fragmentation in voltage islands within a given power bound) depending on the design requirement.

Leakage power is especially affected by variability because of its exponential dependence on the highly varying transistor channel length and threshold voltage. This paper describes the new technology mapping algorithm that performs library binding to maximize parametric yield limited both by timing and power constraints. This is the first work that rigorously treats variability in circuit leakage power and delay within logic synthesis. Experiments show that moving the concerns about variability into logic synthesis is justified. The results on industrial and public benchmarks indicate that, on avenge, the reduction in stand-by power can be up to 26% and can be as high as 50% for some benchmarks. The reduction is purely due to a more effective decision-making of the mapping algorithm, and is achieved without a timing parametric yield loss. Alternatively, the algorithm leads to the delay reduction of up to 17%, with a 10% avenge possible reduction across the benchmarks, for stringent leakage constraints at a fixed yield level. Parametric yield at a fixed leakage target can also be substantially increased. In some examples, the statistical mapper leads to a 80% yield at the leakage value for which the deterministic mapper guaranteed only a 50% yield.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560121","","Circuit synthesis;Decision making;Delay;Energy consumption;Leakage current;Libraries;Logic circuits;Minimization;Threshold voltage;Timing","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;logic design;statistical analysis;timing","decision-making;leakage power constraint;library binding;logic synthesis;parametric yield;statistical technology mapping;threshold voltage;varying transistor channel length","","4","1","30","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, based on RAS, a cocktail scan scheme is proposed and demonstrated to improve the test efficiency significantly. The scheme adopts a two-phase approach, firstly by using a cycle random scan test with a few random seed patterns to test the DUT and secondly, by using the RAS mechanism to test the circuit. Due to employment of a revised process and several strategies, namely, test response abundant, constrained static compaction, and bit propagation before test vector dropping, it is very effective in reducing bit flipping and test data volume, consequently, the test application time and power. Experimental results show that the scheme can achieve 86% reduction in test data volume and 10 times of speedup in test application time.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560046","","Built-in self-test;Circuit testing;Compaction;Data engineering;Design engineering;Electronic equipment testing;Employment;Power engineering and energy;Sequential analysis;Sequential circuits","automatic test pattern generation;boundary scan testing;circuit testing;logic testing;sequential circuits","bit propagation;cocktail scan scheme;constrained static compaction;cycle random scan test;low power test;random access scan;random seed patterns;scan design;sequential circuits;test vector dropping","","2","","20","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The methodology is based on rule composition, and relies on the fact that a rule derived by the composition of two rules behaves as if the two rules were scheduled simultaneously. Rule composition is a well understood transformation in the TRS theoretical framework; however, previous rule composition approaches resulted in an explosion of the number of rules during synthesis, making them impractical for realistic designs. We avoid this problem through composition of conditional actions which generates one rule instead of 2<sup>n</sup> rules when we combine n rules. We then show how this conditional composition of rules can be compiled into an efficient hardware structure which introduces new but derived interfaces in modules. We demonstrate the approach via a small circuit example (GCD) and then show its impact on the methodology to implement pipelined processors in Bluespec. Many ways of dealing with branches in pipelined processors or bypassing values can be expressed simply as different schedules. The results show improvements in performance over previous rule-based synthesis approaches as well as the ease of performance-related architectural exploration. In a somewhat surprising result, we show that simply by specifying a different schedule, one can automatically transform a single-issue processor pipeline into a superscalar pipeline.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560170","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Dispatching;Explosions;Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Process design;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm","high level synthesis;pipeline processing;processor scheduling","Bluespec;guarded atomic actions;hardware synthesis;performance specifications;rule composition;rule-based synthesis;scheduling specifications;single-issue processor pipeline;superscalar pipeline","","9","","9","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a novel, accurate estimator of net lengths. We observe that in ""good"" placements, the length of a net is very strongly correlated with the numbers of nets in the shortest paths connecting node pairs of the net, when each shortest path is computed under the restriction that the net itself does not exist. We refer to this as the net's intrinsic shortest path length (ISPL). Using ISPL as a wirelength estimator has several advantages: (1) it transparently handles multi-pin nets and is a strong predictor of their length; (2) it strongly correlates with the average netlist wirelength; (3) it has a distribution that is similar to that of wirelength; and (4) it acts as a good predictor for individual net lengths. Based on ISPLs, we characterize VLSI netlists with a single value and develop an intuitive, empirical link between our proposed value and the Rent parameter. We also analytically model the relationship between ISPL and wirelength, and use ISPLs in two practical applications: a priori total wirelength estimation and a priori global interconnect prediction.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560059","","Computer science;Extrapolation;Field programmable gate arrays;Joining processes;Parameter estimation;Partitioning algorithms;Predictive models;Process design;Routing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout","VLSI netlists;global interconnect prediction;individual net length;intrinsic shortest path length;multipin nets;netlist wirelength;node pair connections;wirelength characteristics;wirelength estimation","","4","","36","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increasingly it will not be possible to completely validate hardware prior to fabrication. We will need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that hardware, like software, will be shipped with bugs. However, this can be acceptable with appropriate mechanisms for runtime validation that detect bugs and recover from them when needed. This paper takes a significant step in examining runtime validation as part of the verification methodology. It examines the strengths and weaknesses of runtime validation and how it may be used to complement model checking in a hybrid methodology. We consider the use of on-chip hardware for detecting bugs using hardware assertions. These assertions may be used for validating abstractions and assumptions for use in offline model checking. Hardware based assertions monitor properties at runtime and do not suffer from the state explosion problem. Offline model checking is used to validate globally distributed properties where runtime error detection has limitations in monitoring and responding to signals separated by many clock cycles. In this case the hardware based runtime validated abstractions and assumptions help in reducing the state space for model checking. Our ideas are demonstrated on a highly concurrent, yet simple to understand token sharing protocol, as well as a fairly complex cache coherence system.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560217","","Clocks;Computer bugs;Explosions;Fabrication;Hardware;Monitoring;Power generation;Protocols;Runtime;State-space methods","built-in self test;circuit testing;formal verification;modal analysis","bugs detection;cache coherence system;clock cycles;hardware designs;model checking;on-chip hardware;runtime error detection;runtime validation;token sharing protocol;verification methodology","","7","","14","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, a recursive Arnoldi algorithm is proposed to quickly construct the Krylov subspace that is required for parameterized order reduction. Applying the recursive Arnoldi algorithm significantly reduces the computation cost for model generation. Several RC and RLC interconnect examples demonstrate that CORE can provide up to 10× better modeling accuracy than other traditional techniques, while achieving smaller model complexity (i.e. size).

The explicit capacitance representation applies the orthogonal principle factor analysis to greatly reduce the number of random variables associated with modeling conductor surface fluctuations while preserving the dominant sources of variations, and consequently the variational capacitance model can be efficiently utilized by statistical model order reduction and timing analysis tools.

Using the same code but different data partitionings, we can achieve faster clock frequencies, without increasing the number of cycles, by simply minimizing global memory accesses.

A solution to counter timing uncertainty is post-silicon clock tuning. Existing design approaches for post-silicon-tunable (PST) clock-tree synthesis usually insert a PST clock buffer for each flip-flop or put PST clock buffers across an entire level of a clock-tree. This can cause significant over-design and long tuning time. In this paper, we propose to insert PST clock buffers at both internal and leaf nodes of a clock-tree and use a bottom-up algorithm to reduce the number of candidate PST clock buffer locations. We then provide two statistical-timing-driven optimization algorithms to reduce the hardware cost of a PST clock-tree. Experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show that our algorithms achieve up to a 90% area or a 90% number of tunable clock buffer reductions compared to existing design methods.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560132","","Clocks;Cost function;Counting circuits;Degradation;Design methodology;Flip-flops;Hardware;Timing;Tunable circuits and devices;Uncertainty","buffer circuits;circuit tuning;clocks;flip-flops;logic design;trees (electrical)","PST clock buffer;deep sub-micron technologies;flip-flop;post-silicon-tunable clock-tree synthesis;statistical timing analysis;statistical-timing-driven optimization;timing uncertainty;tunable clock buffer reduction;yield degradation","","25","","17","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because such accesses can be extremely costly from both performance and power angles. While conventional data locality optimization techniques can be used for improving data access pattern of each processor independently, such techniques usually do not consider locality for shared data. This paper proposes a strategy that reduces the number of off-chip references due to shared data. It achieves this goal by restructuring a parallelized application code in such a fashion that a given data block is accessed by parallel processors within the same time frame, so that its reuse is maximized while it is in the on-chip memory space. This tends to minimize the number of off-chip references since the accesses to a given data block are clustered within a short period of time during execution. Our approach employs a polyhedral tool that helps us isolate computations that manipulate a given data block.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560076","","Clocks;Computer architecture;Computer science;Energy consumption;Hardware;Memory management;Parallel processing;Power engineering and energy;Software maintenance;Switches","cache storage;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips;parallel processing;system-on-chip","MPSoC architectures;cache performance;code restructuring;data access pattern;data block;data locality optimization techniques;off-chip memory accesses;off-chip references;on-chip memory space;parallel processors;parallelized application code;polyhedral tool","","2","","18","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study an important routing problem encountered in typical high-end MCM designs: routing within dense pin clusters. Pin clusters are often formed by pins that belong to the same functional unit or the same data bus, and can become bottlenecks in terms of overall routability. Topically, these clusters have irregular shapes, which can be approximated with rectilinear convex boundaries. Since such boundaries have often irregular shapes, a traditional escape routing algorithm may give unroutable solutions. In this paper, we study how the positions of escape terminals on a convex boundary affect the overall routability. For this purpose, we propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions to model routability outside a rectilinear convex boundary. Given an escape routing solution, we propose an optimal algorithm to select the maximal subset of nets that are routable outside the boundary. After that, we focus on an integrated approach to consider routability constraints (outside the boundary) during the actual escape routing algorithm. Here, we propose an optimal algorithm to find the best escape routing solution that satisfies all routability constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the number of layers by 17% on the average, by using this integrated methodology.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560167","","Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Microelectronics;Multichip modules;Packaging;Pins;Routing;Shape;Sufficient conditions;Voltage","integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;multichip modules","MCM designs;circuit density;escape routing algorithm;escape terminals;multichip modules;optimal routing algorithms;package routing problem;pin clusters;rectilinear convex boundary;routability constraints;transistor counts","","2","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a statistical gate sizing methodology for timing yield improvement. We build statistical models for gate delays from library characterizations at multiple process corners and operating conditions. Statistical timing analysis is performed, which drives gate sizing for timing yield optimization. Experimental results are reported for the ISCAS and MCNC benchmarks.

This paper proposes reducing the number of bus lines of the conventional parallel-line bus CB architecture by multiplexing each m-bits onto a single line. This bus architecture, the serial-link bus SLB, transforms an n-bit conventional parallel-line bus into an n/m-line (serial-link) bus. The advantage of serial-link buses is that they have fewer lines, and if the bus width is kept the same, serial- link buses will have larger line width and spacing. Increasing the line width has a twofold reduction effect on the line resistance, as the resistivity of sub-100 nm wires significantly drops as the line width increases. Also, increasing the line width and spacing reduces the coupling capacitance between adjacent lines, but increases the line-to-ground capacitance. Thus, an optimum degree of multiplexing m exists that minimizes the bus energy dissipation and maximizes the bus throughput per-unit area. The optimum degree of multiplexing for maximum throughput-per- unit-area and for minimum energy dissipation for the 25-130 nm technologies was determined in this paper. HSPICE simulations show that; for the same throughput-per-unit-area as conventional parallel-line buses, the serial-link bus architecture reduces the energy dissipation by up to 31.42% for a 64-bit bus implemented in an intermediate metal layer of a 50 nm technology and a reduction of 52.7% is projected for the 25 nm technology.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560126","","Capacitance;Conductivity;Coupling circuits;Delay;Energy dissipation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Laboratories;Power dissipation;Repeaters;Wire","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics","25 to 130 nm;HSPICE;bus energy dissipation;line resistance;line-to-ground capacitance;low-power on-chip bus architecture;nanowire;parallel-line bus CB architecture;serial-link bus","","8","3","22","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach applies to a design style where the operation of the design is controlled by a main FSM which can easily be extracted from the RTL description of the circuit.

A set of equalities and inequalities in the circuit parameters is used to represent the constraints. A feasible parameter space lies at the intersection of the sets of design parameters that satisfy equalities and inequalities, defining a manifold in the parameter space. We introduce a bipartite graph representation denoted analog constraint graphs (ACG) to represent these constraints. ACGs are instrumental for obtaining a random configuration generator that samples configurations in the manifold. The sampler is automatically translated into executable code to fit the characterization framework starting from a mathematical description of constraints. Results show that the automatically generated samplers are comparable in terms of code efficiency with hand-written ones. Furthermore, a heuristics to generate uniformly distributed configuration enabled by the tools is presented and applied to a complex ADC design, yielding a reduction in power consumption by more than 28%.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560104","","Analog circuits;Bipartite graph;Character generation;Computer science;Design methodology;Distributed power generation;Instruments;Sampling methods;Signal design;Support vector machines","analogue integrated circuits;graph theory;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling","ADC design;analog circuits;analog constraint graphs;analog platform characterization;bipartite graph representation;circuit parameters;design parameters;power consumption;random configuration generator;system-level models","","4","","10","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better meet the test requirements for such heterogeneous SOCs, leading tester companies have recently introduced port-scalable testers, which can simultaneously drive groups of channels at different data rates. However the number of tester channels available for scan testing is limited; therefore, a higher shift frequency can increase the test time for a core if the resulting test access architecture reduces the bitwidth used to access it. We present a scalable test planning technique that exploits port scalability of testers to reduce SOC test time.

Importantly, due to the inaccuracy of early-stage system-level models, and the increasing magnitude of process and environmental variations, the system-level exploration must leave sufficient design margin to ensure a successful late-stage implementation. Therefore, instead of minimizing a design objective function, and thereby converging on a constraint boundary, we apply a novel performance centering optimization. Our proposed methodology centers the analog design in the performance space, and maximizes the distance to all constraint boundaries. We demonstrate that this early-stage design margin, which is measured by the volume of the inscribed ellipsoid lying inside the performance constraints, provides an excellent quality measure for comparing different system architectures. The efficacy of our performance centering approach is shown for analog design examples, including a complete clock data recovery system design and implementation.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560105","","Circuit simulation;Circuit topology;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Ellipsoids;Equations;Performance analysis;System analysis and design;System-level design;Volume measurement","analogue integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling","analog design exploration;analog design optimization;analog system architectures;clock data recovery system;constraint boundary;design objective function;independent circuit block design;inscribed ellipsoid;performance-centering optimization;system-level design exploration;system-level models","","6","2","15","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies have been limited to either pipelining or parallel processing, but both techniques can be used together to reduce supply voltage at a fixed throughput point. According to our first-order analyses, there exist optimal combinations of pipelining depth and parallel processing width to minimize total power consumption. We show that the leakage power from both subthreshold and gate-oxide tunneling plays a significant role in determining the optimal combination of pipelining depth and parallel processing width. Our experiments are conducted with timing information derived from a 65nm technology and fanout-of-four (FO4) inverter chains. The experiments show that the optimal combinations of both pipelining and parallel processing - 8 ∼ 12 × FO4 logic depth pipelining with 2 ∼ 3-wide parallel processing - can reduce the total power by as much as 40% compared to an optimal system using only pipelining or parallel processing alone. We extend our study to show how process parameter variations - an increasingly important factor in nanometer technologies - affects these results. Our analyses reveal that the variations shift the optimal points to shallower pipelining and narrower parallel processing - 12 × FO4 logic depth with 2-wide parallel processing - at a fixed yield point.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560125","","Digital systems;Energy consumption;Inverters;Logic;Parallel processing;Pipeline processing;Throughput;Timing;Tunneling;Voltage","logic design;nanotechnology;parallel processing;pipeline processing","65 nm;digital system;fanout-of-four inverter chain;first-order analysis;gate-oxide tunneling;leakage power;logic depth pipelining;nanometer technology;parallel processing;process variation;subthreshold tunneling;timing information;total power reduction;total power-optimal pipelining","","5","","16","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then propose a new heuristic approach to incrementally compute the gradient of yield with respect to gate sizes in the circuit with high efficiency and accuracy. We then show how this gradient information can be effectively used by a non-linear optimizer to perform yield optimization.

The efficiency of timing analysis is critical for the performance driven optimization program because timing analysis is invoked heavily in the inner loop. However, when false paths are dealt in timing analysis, a large number of tags need to be created and propagated, and thus deteriorated the efficiency. In this paper, we minimize the number of the tags through a biclique covering approach, which iteratively removes a tag if the false path information in the tag is covered by the union of other tags. The produced tags remove the false path timing and guarantee to cover the true path timings. Since the minimum biclique covering of the general bipartite graph is NP complete, we use a minimal degree ordering approach to perform the biclique covering minimization. The experimental results show significant reduction on the number of tags.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560123","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bipartite graph;Circuit optimization;Cost function;Graphics;Merging;Minimization;Performance analysis;Timing","circuit analysis computing;circuit optimisation;timing","NP complete;biclique covering;bipartite graph;false path;false sub-graphs;static timing analysis;tag minimization","","4","","8","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We model this problem as a Boolean network that covers all possible partial terms which may be used to generate the set of coefficients in the MCM instance. The PIs to this network are shifted versions of the MCM input. An AND gate represents an adder or a subtracter, i.e., an AND gate generates a new partial term. All partial terms that have the same numerical value are ORed together. There is a single output which is an ∧ over all the coefficients in the MCM. We cast this problem into a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) problem by requiring that the output is asserted while minimizing the total number of AND gates that evaluate to one. A SAT-based solver is used to obtain the exact solution. We argue that for many real problems the size of the problem is within the capabilities of current SAT solvers. We present results using binary, CSD and MSD representations. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results. One is that, in many cases, existing heuristics perform well, computing the best solution, or one close to it. The other is that the flexibility of the MSD representation does not have a significant impact in the solution obtained.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560032","","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Energy consumption;Fast Fourier transforms;Finite impulse response filter;Hardware;Integer linear programming;Signal processing algorithms","Boolean functions;FIR filters;adders;digital arithmetic;integer programming;linear programming;logic design;logic gates","AND gates;Boolean network;CSD representation;MSD representation;SAT-based solver;adders;binary representation;exact algorithm;integer linear programming;maximal partial term sharing;multiple constant multiplication;set of coefficient;subtracters","","17","1","8","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose new algorithms for rewiring and rebuffering - a post-placement optimization that reconnects pins of a given netlist without changing the logic function and gate locations. These techniques are compatible with separate layout and logic optimizations, and appear independent of them. In particular, when the new optimization is applied before or after detailed placement, it approximately doubles the improvement in wirelength. Our contributions are based on exhaustive search for functional symmetries in sub-circuits consisting of several gates. Our graph-based symmetry finding is more comprehensive than previously known algorithms - it detects permutational and phase-shift symmetries on multiple input and output wires, as well as hybrid symmetries, creating more opportunities for rewiring and rebuffering.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560040","","Boolean functions;Circuit optimization;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Inverters;Logic circuits;Logic functions;Phase detection;Pins;Wires","Boolean functions;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;logic CAD;logic gates;wiring","circuit optimization;functional symmetry;graph-based symmetry;layout optimization;logic functions;logic gate location;logic optimization;permutational symmetry;phase-shift symmetry;pin reconnections;post placement rebuffering;post-placement rewiring","","6","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a novel quadratic extension of the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration, called QADI, that efficiently solves a CARE. A Cholesky factor variant of QADI, called CFQADI, further exploits low rank matrices and and produces solution in factor form that greatly accelerates BST.

Butramin considers a bug trace produced by a random simulator or a semi-formal verification software and produces an equivalent trace of shorter length. Butramin applies a range of minimization techniques, deploying both simulation-based and formal methods, with the objective of producing highly reduced traces that still expose the original bug. We evaluated Butramin on a range of designs, including the publicly available picoJava microprocessor.

We suggest an alternative in which uncertainties are represented as correlated intervals, and interval-valued computations replace the standard scalar operations in the numerical algorithm for the tool. We use an oxide chemical-mechanical polishing tool as an example, and show how to ""retrofit"" workable statistical models on top of the original algorithm. Accuracies to within ∼1-10% of Monte Carlo simulation, and speedups of ∼10-100X can be achieved, depending on whether we choose a formulation which emphasizes accuracy, or efficiency.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560054","","Chemical technology;Design optimization;Fabrication;Integrated circuit interconnections;Monte Carlo methods;Nanoscale devices;Predictive models;Semiconductor device modeling;Silicon;Uncertainty","chemical mechanical polishing;semiconductor process modelling;statistical analysis","interval-valued computations;interval-valued statistical modeling;oxide chemical-mechanical polishing;process variational impacts","","0","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present two novel techniques that can efficiently evaluate path criticality under statistical non-linear delay models. They are integrated into a block-based statistical timing tool with the capability of handling arbitrary correlations from manufacturing process dependence and also path sharing.

A design verified at the logic synthesis level may have timing closure problems at post-layout stages due to the emergence of multiple-clock-period interconnects. Consequently, a trade-off between clock frequency and throughput may be needed to meet the design requirements. In this paper, we find that the processing rate, defined as the product of frequency and throughput, of a sequential system is upper bounded by the reciprocal of its maximum cycle ratio, which is only dependent on the clustering. We formulate the problem of processing rate optimization as seeking an optimal clustering with the minimal maximum-cycle-ratio in a general graph, and present an iterative algorithm to solve it. Since our algorithm avoids binary search and is essentially incremental, it has the potential of being combined with other optimization techniques. Experimental results validate the efficiency of our algorithm.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560062","","Clocks;Delay;Flip-flops;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Large-scale systems;Logic design;Pipeline processing;Throughput","circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;iterative methods;logic CAD;logic partitioning;sequential circuits","iterative algorithm;large scale design;logic partitioning;logic synthesis;maximum-cycle-ratio;multiple-clock-period interconnects;optimization techniques;post-layout stages;processing rate optimization;sequential system","","0","","21","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An edge from one vertex to another implies that the former gene regulates the latter. Statistical features of Kauffman networks match the characteristics of living cells. The number of cycles in the network's state space, called attractors, corresponds to the number of different cell types. The attractor's length corresponds to the cell cycle time. The sensitivity of attractors to different kinds of disturbances, modeled by changing a network connection, the state of a vertex, or the associated function, reflects the stability of the cell to damage, mutations and virus attacks. In order to evaluate attractors, their number and lengths have to be computed. This problem is the major open problem related to Kauffman networks. Available algorithms can only handle networks with less than a hundred vertices. The number of genes in a cell is often larger. In this paper, we present a set of efficient algorithms for computing attractors in large Kauffman networks. The resulting software package is hoped to be of assistance in understanding the principles of gene interactions and discovering a computing scheme operating on these principles.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560115","","Automata;Circuit synthesis;Computer networks;DNA;Jacobian matrices;Network synthesis;Partitioning algorithms;Pediatrics;Stability;State-space methods","biomolecular electronics;genetics;network analysis;sensitivity analysis","Kauffman network;attractor sensitivity;cell cycle time;cell damage;gene interaction;gene regulatory network;living cell;mutation;network analysis;network connection;software package;vertex state;virus attack","","3","","44","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a novel approach to the thermal analysis at chip architecture level for efficient dynamic thermal management. Our new approach is based on the observation that the power consumption of architecture level modules in microprocessors running typical workloads presents strong nature of periodicity. Such a feature can be exploited by fast spectrum analysis in frequency domain for computing steady state response. To obtain the transient temperature changes due to initial condition and constant power inputs, numerically stable moment matching approach is carried out. The total transient responses is the addition of the two simulation results.

Many fault tolerant techniques for improving the yield of processors with a cache memory have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a defect-aware code placement technique which offsets the performance degradation of a processor with a defective cache memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compiler-based technique which offsets the performance degradation due to cache defects. Experiments demonstrate that the technique can compensate the performance degradation even when 5% of cache lines are faulty. In some cases the technique was able to offset the impact even in presence of 25% faulty cache-lines.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560207","","Cache memory;Circuit faults;Degradation;Error correction codes;Fault tolerance;Laboratories;Logic arrays;Logic design;Microprocessors;Partitioning algorithms","cache storage;fault tolerant computing;microprocessor chips","cache defect;cache memory;cache-defect-aware code placement algorithm;compiler-based technique;fault tolerant computing;fault-free section;faulty cache-line;microprocessor chips;processor performance degradation","","5","","25","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we explore solutions to the inter-object connectivity problem in heap memory of Java-based embedded environments. Our objective is to ensure that the connections between the objects are consistent. In particular, we want to detect the cases where an inter-object link disappears or points to a wrong object. To address this problem, we propose a rule based approach, where the application programmer expresses the important connectivity rules to be satisfied using a special rule language, and a modified JVM (Java virtual machine) checks these rules at runtime.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560083","","Charge carriers;Circuits;Data structures;Embedded system;Java;Object detection;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime;Virtual machining","Java;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;knowledge based systems;virtual machines","Java virtual machine;Java-based embedded systems;application programmer;connectivity rules;heap memory;inter-object connections;inter-object link;rule based approach;rule language;runtime integrity checking","","0","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This way, we can better exploit the benefits of both complete regularity and partial customization. Indeed, our experimental results show that inserting application-specific long-range links significantly increases the critical traffic workload at which the network state transits from a free to a congested regime.

This is achieved through the addition of partially redundant connections between metal fills and power meshes. Our technique is especially significant for 90nm process technology or below because (1) metal fill must now be done as part of the IC implementation flow due to its increasing impact on timing, (2) the tolerance for IR drop is tightening due to voltage scaling, and the increasingly conservative power mesh design to address IR-drop is adding significant burden on the available routing resources, (3) IR-drop is getting worse due to increasing design sizes, and (4) the large degree of design uncertainty demands IRdrop repair capabilities that can be applied after routing is completed. SPIDER addresses all these issues practically with little or no cost. Experimental results further demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of our approach: SPIDER achieves an average IR-drop reduction of 62.2% in 16 designs of various sizes.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560036","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer applications;Design automation;Design optimization;Integrated circuit yield;Routing;Switches;Timing;Voltage","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit metallisation;integrated circuit yield","90 nm;IR-drop reduction;IR-drop tolerance;SPIDER methodology;conservative power mesh design;metal density enhancement;metal density requirement;metal fill;partial redundant connections;power distribution network;redundant fill;simultaneous post-layout IR-drop;voltage drop;yield optimization","","9","","18","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our algorithms are extremely fast and guarantee convergence to the exact solutions. In fact, they can be considered as efficient implementations of the classical successive over relaxation iterative method for solving linear systems. Our methods take full advantage of the special structure of the power grid.

Operations are assigned to one or several consecutive cycles (multicycle operators) and one operation cannot begin until all its predecessors have finished, except for operations chaining. This technique allows the execution in the same cycle of several data-dependent operations, being some bits of the chained operations calculated in parallel. Chaining one operation to its predecessor requires the completion of both in the selected cycle. This paper presents a less restrictive technique based on the softening of the read-after-write dependencies among operations, which allows beginning the execution of one operation before the calculus of its predecessors has been completed. This becomes feasible when the execution of the predecessor has begun in the selected cycle or in a previous one, and even if it finishes in a posterior cycle.

Under a unified mechanism, two output variables representing the final topography: the array height and the step height are modeled simultaneously. Using the proposed model long-range effects of the ECP process can be incorporated easily as well. The simulation results of our model were verified with test structure experimental data published in the literature and are presented in this paper. The results show that the errors are less than 5%. This model is not limited to the regular test structures; it can also be used for any practical design. The results of such partial application are shown here as well. Our proposed ECP model can be used to model systematic variations caused by an ECP process or by a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process.

An important characteristic of these memory components is that they are managed by software, instead of hardware. Ever-scaling process technology and employment of several power-saving techniques in embedded systems (e.g., voltage scaling) make these systems particularly vulnerable to soft errors and other transient errors. Therefore, it is very important in practice to consider the impact of soft errors in SPMs. While it is possible to employ classical memory protection mechanisms such as parity checks and ECC, each of these has its drawbacks. Specifically, a pure parity-based protection cannot correct any errors, and ECCs can be an overkill in the normal operation state when no soft error is experienced. This paper proposes an alternate approach to protect SPMs against soft errors. The proposed approach is based on data block duplication under compiler control. More specifically, an optimizing compiler duplicates data blocks within the SPM and protects each data block by parity if such a duplication does not hurt performance. The goal of this scheme is to provide only parity protection for data blocks (and reduce the overheads at runtime when no error occurs) but correct errors using the duplicate (when an error occurs in the primary copy), provided that the duplicate is not corrupted.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560208","","Embedded computing;Embedded system;Employment;Error correction;Hardware;Memory management;Power system management;Protection;Scanning probe microscopy;Voltage","cache storage;embedded systems;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;program compilers","ECC;compiler-guided data block duplication;embedded computing;embedded systems;memory components;memory protection mechanisms;on-chip storage;parity checks;parity-based protection;scratch-pad memory reliability;soft errors;transient error;voltage scaling","","7","","19","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the cell power noise estimation, we add decap padding to each cell. Then we invoke a standard cell placement tool and perform power grid analysis. We eliminate the power grid noise by gate sizing. Our technique can reallocate decaps to improve power noise, power consumption, and timing.

Our modeling approach uses a process of time shifting and time stretching of a set of so-called base-waveforms. These base-waveforms are selected from a large set of noisy waveform shapes that occur in interconnect structures with coupling and other types of noise, such that the delay error across all considered waveforms is minimized. Depending on the desired accuracy one or more base-waveforms can be used. This method is also used to model the gate output waveforms allowing for closure, in terms of the used base-waveforms across a circuit library. We show that the determination of the optimal set of base-waveforms under such input-to-output closure is exponential in complexity. We, therefore, propose an heuristic approach that maps the problem to the unate covering problem for which efficient solution methods are available. The new delay model can be applied in a timing analysis program with minor changes.

While decision procedures such as those implemented in UCLID can be used to verify pipelined machines, the models are at the term level: they abstract away the datapath, require the use of numerous abstractions, implement a small subset of the instruction set, and are far from executable. In contrast, we focus on verifying executable machines with bit-level interfaces. Such proofs have previously required substantial expert guidance and the use of deductive reasoning engines. We show that by integrating UCLID with the ACL2 theorem proving system, we can use ACL2 to reduce the proof that an executable, bit-level machine refines its instruction set architecture to a proof that a term level abstraction of the bit-level machine refines the instruction set architecture, which is then handled automatically by UCLID. In this way, we exploit the strengths of ACL2 and UCLID to prove theorems that are not possible to even state using UCLID and that would require prohibitively more effort using just ACL2.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560182","","Aerospace electronics;Application software;Computer architecture;Computer interfaces;Educational institutions;Engines;Hardware;Microprocessors;Refining;Software safety","bisimulation equivalence;circuit CAD;pipeline processing;theorem proving","ACL2 theorem proving system;UCLID;bit-level interfaces;datapath;decision procedures;deductive reasoning;executable pipelined machines;instruction set architecture;term level abstraction","","1","","33","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In deep submicron technologies, power supply noise can significantly increase the circuit delay and lead to performance failures. Traditional static timing analysis which applies worst-case voltage margins to compute circuit delay leads to a very conservative analysis because the worst-case drop is localized to a small area of the die. In this paper, we propose a new approach for analyzing the impact of power supply variations on circuit delay. The circuit delay maximization problem is formulated as a constrained non-linear optimization problem which takes both IR and Ldi/dt drops into account The proposed approach does not require apriori knowledge of critical paths in the circuit and can be effectively incorporated in an existing static timing analysis framework. The proposed method has been implemented and tested on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits and compared with the traditional methods for computing worst-case circuit delay under supply variations.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560095","","Circuit noise;Circuit testing;Delay;Fluctuations;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance analysis;Power supplies;Timing;Voltage","circuit optimisation;delays;integrated circuit design;power supply circuits;timing circuits","circuit delay maximization problem;critical paths;deep submicron technologies;nonlinear optimization problem;power supply integrity verification;power supply noise;power supply variations;static timing analysis;worst-case circuit delay;worst-case drop","","12","1","17","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a fully-automated efficient compositional minimization approach which requires only static analysis. Key to our approach is a heuristic algorithm that identifies components with high reduction potential in a bit-level netlist. We next inject combinational logic which restricts the component's inputs to selected representatives of symbolically-computed equivalence classes thereof. Finally, we use existing transformations to synergistically exploit the dramatic netlist reductions enabled by these input filters.

The physical transmission line is no longer limited to a direct-coupled metal wire. Rather, it can be accomplished via either wired or wireless mediums through capacitor couplers that reduce the baseband noise and DC power consumption.

ICCAD-2005. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20051219","2005","","","279","282","In the context of data-intensive embedded applications, there have been two complementary approaches to data locality problem: restructuring code and restructuring data layout. Conceivably, an integrated approach that combines these two can generate much better results than each individual approach. However, there is an inherent difficulty in optimizing both data layout and loop access pattern simultaneously under a unified setting. This difficulty occurs due to the fact that a given data structure can be accessed by different loop nests of the application, and each such loop nest can demand a different memory layout transformation for the said data structure. This results in a coupling problem, where the behaviors of two (or more) loop nests are coupled to each other as a result of data sharing between them. In this paper, we present a constraint network (CN) based formulation of the integrated loop-data optimization problem. We present two alternate solutions to the data locality problem with our CN based formulation and discuss the pros and cons of each scheme. The first solution is a pure backtracking based one, whereas the second one improves upon the first one by employing three additional optimizations, including backjumping.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560078","","Application software;Constraint optimization;Data structures;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware;Multimedia systems;Optimizing compilers;Robustness;System performance","constraint handling;embedded systems;memory architecture;storage management","backjumping optimization;code restructuring;constraint network theory;data layout restructuring;data locality problem;loop-data optimizations","","1","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While steady progress has been made in the tools and methodologies of automatic instruction set extension for configurable processors, recent study has shown that the limited data bandwidth available in the core processor (e.g., the number of simultaneous accesses to the register file) becomes a serious performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new low-cost architectural extension and associated compilation techniques to address the data bandwidth problem. Specifically, we embed a single control bit in the instruction op-codes to selectively copy the execution results to a set of hash-mapped shadow registers in the write-back stage. This can efficiently reduce the communication overhead due to data transfers between the core processor and the custom logic. We also present a novel simultaneous global shadow register binding with a hash function generation algorithm to take full advantage of the extension. The application of our approach leads to a nearly-optimal performance speedup (within 2% of the ideal speedup).","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560075","","Application software;Application specific processors;Bandwidth;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Computer science;Hardware;Logic;Registers;Runtime","embedded systems;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;microprocessor chips","architectural extension techniques;associated compilation techniques;automatic instruction set;configurable embedded processors;core processor;custom logic;data bandwidth;data transfers;global shadow register;hash function generation algorithm;hash-mapped shadow registers;instruction op-codes;write-back stage","","2","","19","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The additional force which distributes the modules on the chip in force-directed quadratic placement is separated into two forces: hold force and move force. Both of these forces are determined without any heuristics. Based on this novel systematic force implementation, we show that our iterative placement algorithm converges to an overlap-free placement. In addition, engineering change order (ECO) is efficiently supported by our placer. To handle the important trade-off between CPU time and placement quality, a deterministic quality control is presented. In addition, a new linear net model is proposed, which accurately models the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) in the quadratic cost function of quadratic placement. HPWL in general is a linear metric for netlength and represents an efficient and common estimation for routed wirelength. Compared with the classical clique net model, our linear net model reduces memory usage by 75%, CPU time by 23% and netlength by 8%, which is measured by the HPWL of all nets. Using the ISPD-2005 benchmark suite for comparison, our placer combined with the new linear net model has just 5.9% higher netlength but is 16times faster than APlace, which offers the best netlength in this benchmark. Compared to Capo, our placer has 9.2% lower netlength and is 5.4times faster.

In this work, we propose a Monte-Carlo driven stochastic optimization framework that does not rely on the distribution of the varying parameters (unlike most other existing techniques). Stochastic techniques like successive sample mean optimization (SSMO) and stochastic decomposition present a strong framework for solving linear programming formulations in which the parameters behave as random variables. We consider binning-yield loss (BYL) as the optimization objective and show that we can get a provably optimal solution under a convex BYL function. We apply this framework for the MTCMOS sizing problem [Khandelwal, V., et al., 2005] using SSMO and stochastic decomposition techniques.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","464","471","Because of the increasing dominance of interconnect issues in advanced IC technology, placement has become a critical step in the IC design flow. To get accurate interconnect information during the placement process, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into it. However, previous global routers are computationally expensive. It is impractical to perform global routing repeatedly during placement. In this paper, we present an extremely fast and high-quality global router called FastRoute. In traditional global routing approaches, congestion is not considered during Steiner tree construction. So they have to rely on the time-consuming maze routing technique to eliminate routing congestion. Different from traditional approaches, we proposed a congestion-driven Steiner tree topology generation technique and an edge shifting technique to determine the good Steiner tree topologies and Steiner node positions. Based on the congestion-driven Steiner trees, we only need to apply maze routing to a small percentage of the two-pin nets once to obtain high quality global routing solutions. We also proposed a new cost function based on logistic function to direct the maze routing. Experimental results show that FastRoute generates less congested solutions in 132times and 64times faster runtimes than the state-of-the-art academic global routers Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al, 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (R. T. Hadsell and P. H. Madden, 2003), respectively. It is even faster than the highly-efficient congestion estimator FaDGloR (J. Westra and P. Groeneveld, 2005). The promising results make it possible to incorporate global routing directly into placement process without much runtime penalty. This could dramatically improve the placement solution quality. We believe this work will fundamentally change the way the EDA community look at and make use of global routing in the whole design flow","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110216","","Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Permission;Routing;Runtime;Steiner trees;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces","integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","Chi Dispersion router;FaDGloR;FastRoute;IC design flow;Labyrinth router;Steiner tree topology generation;advanced IC technology;congestion estimation;edge shifting;electronic design automation;global routing;logistic function;maze routing;placement process","","36","2","21","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous bundling method (Chan et al., 2005) introduces a huge error which compromises the performance. We present an error-free bundling approach which utilizes the piecewise linear wire length function of a pair of blocks. With the function implemented into a lookup table, the wire length can be computed promptly and precisely by binary search.

For each “hotspot” where placement overfill occurs, an expansion region covering the hotspot is constructed. Then the movable cells within each of these expansion regions are evenly assigned to density bins inside the expansion region by displacement-minimizing recursive bisection. In addition, a fast density-preserving and wirelength-reducing discrete refinement is applied to the first few LAL placements before each of these is used to augment the quadratic model used to obtain the next major placement iteration.

In region-based MSV, circuits are partitioned into ""voltage islands"" where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one supply voltage. In a work by Wu et al. (2005), this supply voltage partitioning problem is addressed, and the input circuit is partitioned into a slicing structure with every voltage island rectangular in shape. This unnecessary restriction on the structure and island shapes has caused a significant degradation in the solution quality. In this paper, we propose a method to solve this voltage island generation problem without these restrictions.

Recent efforts in digital hardware security aim to thwart piracy by using XOR-based chip locking, cryptography, and active metering. To counter direct attacks and lower the exposure of unlocked circuits to the foundry, we introduce a multiplexor-based locking strategy that preserves test response allowing IC testing by an untrusted party before activation.
