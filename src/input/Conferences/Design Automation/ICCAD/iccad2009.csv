In memory based reconfigurable computing frameworks, which use large high density memory array, such failures lead to incorrect execution of mapped applications. It causes loss in quality of service (QoS) for digital signal processing (DSP) applications. We propose a Â¿preferential designÂ¿ approach at both application mapping and circuit level, which can significantly improve QoS and yield under large parameter variations. Such a architecture/circuit co-design approach can also tolerate increased failure rate at low operating voltage, thus facilitating low-power operation. Simulation results for a common DSP application show 45% improvement in power at iso-QoS and 47% in yield for a target peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) at 45 nm technology.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361296","","Circuits;Degradation;Digital signal processing;Discrete cosine transforms;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic arrays;Performance loss;Processor scheduling;Quality of service;Registers","CAD;SRAM chips;digital signal processing chips;quality of service;reconfigurable architectures","SRAM;architecture-circuit codesign;digital signal processing;large high density memory array;low-power operation;memory based reconfigurable computing;peak signal to noise ratio;quality of service;static random access memory arrays;variation-aware preferential design","","0","4","10","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an integrated solution for achieving significantly higher EDP in these frameworks by leveraging on the read-dominant memory access pattern. First, we propose to employ an asymmetric memory cell design, which provides higher read performance (~2X) and lower read power (~1.6X) in order to improve the overall EDP during operation. Exploiting the fact that the proposed memory cell provides better read power/performance for cells storing logic `0', next we propose a content-aware application mapping approach, which tries to maximize the logic `0' content in the LUTs. We show that the joint circuit and application mapping level optimization approach provides significant improvement in system EDP for a set of benchmark circuits.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361305","Content-aware Mapping;Low Power;Memory Design;Reconfigurable Frameworks","Delay;Design optimization;Field programmable gate arrays;High performance computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Permission;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Reconfigurable logic;Table lookup","field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;logic design;storage management chips;table lookup","application mapping level optimization approach;asymmetric memory cell design;benchmark circuits;circuit-software codesign approach;content-aware mapping approach;energy-delay product;field programmable gate arrays;lookup table;memory cell;read-dominant memory access pattern;reconfigurable computing frameworks;two-dimensional memory array","","0","","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To guarantee full process space coverage, the ensemble of critical paths of all chips irrespective of their manufacturing process conditions needs to be tested, as different chips may have different critical paths. Existing coverage-based path selection techniques, however, suffer from the loss of coverage after ATPG (automatic test pattern generation), i.e., although the pre-ATPG path selection achieves good coverage, after ATPG, the coverage can be severely reduced as many paths turn out to be unsensitizable. This paper presents a novel path selection algorithm that, without running ATPG, selects a set of n paths to achieve near optimal post-ATPG coverage. Details of the algorithm and its optimality conditions are discussed. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed algorithm achieves not only superior post-ATPG coverage, but also significant runtime speedup.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361310","Optimality;Path Selection;Process Space Coverage","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Delay;Manufacturing processes;Permission;Space technology;System testing;Timing","automatic test pattern generation;delays;integrated circuit testing","automatic test pattern generation;critical paths;optimal post ATPG process space coverage;path delay testing;path selection algorithm;pre-ATPG path selection","","0","3","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, designers are left either to manually process such modifications by hand or to restart the design process from scratch - a very costly option. In order to address this issue, we present DeltaSyn, a method for generating a highly optimized logic difference between a modified high-level specification and an implemented design. DeltaSyn has the ability to locate boundaries in implemented logic within which changes can be confined. Delta-Syn demarcates the boundary in two phases. The first phase employs fast functional and structural analysis techniques to identify equivalent signals forming the input-side boundary of the changes. The second phase locates the output-side boundary of the changes through a novel dynamic algorithm that detects matching logic downstream from the changes required by the ECO. Experiments on industrial designs show that together these techniques successfully implement ECOs while preserving an average of 97% of the existing logic. Unlike previous approaches, the use of bit-parallel logic simulation and fast SAT solvers enables high performance and scalability. DeltaSyn can process and verify a typical ECO for a design of around 10K gates in about 200 seconds or less.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361205","","Design optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Logic design;Permission;Phase detection;Process design;Routing;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Signal synthesis","high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;integrated logic circuits","DeltaSyn;ECO synthesis;IC design;functional specifications;logic difference optimizer;modified high-level specification","","4","2","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361306","Design obfuscation;hardware Trojan;hardware security","Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Hardware;Information security;Logic design;National security;Permission;Protection;State-space methods","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;invasive software;monolithic integrated circuits;national security;safety-critical software","design obfuscation;internal circuit nodes;malicious hardware Trojan;reachable state space;safety-critical applications;security;state transition function","","2","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Present commercial thermal analysis tools are incapable of simulating complex structures, particularly in the 3-D domain and are also difficult to integrate with existing design tools. Existing analytical thermal models are not perfect either: they are either not accurate enough or oversimplified. This paper uses a methodology, which exploits existing electrical resistance solvers for thermal simulation, to allow fast acquisition of thermal profiles of complex interconnect structures with good accuracy and reasonable computation cost. Moreover, for the first time, an accurate closed-form thermal model is developed. The model allows for an equivalent medium with effective thermal conductivity (isotropic or anisotropic) to replace the detailed material information in non-critical regions so that complex interconnect structures can be simulated. Using these techniques, this paper demonstrates the simulation of a very complex interconnect structure (~9000 objects or 15 million meshed unknowns after first order isotropic equivalent medium replacement), which is a first time achievement in the area of interconnect thermal analysis. On the other hand, it is shown that an anisotropic equivalent medium is a much better approximation of real interconnect structures from the point of view of accuracy and computation.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361226","","Analytical models;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit reliability;System performance;Thermal conductivity;Thermal resistance;Very large scale integration","VLSI;electrical resistivity;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;thermal analysis;thermal conductivity","3-D thermal analysis;VLSI interconnect thermal profiles;analytical thermal models;anisotropic thermal conductivity;closed-form thermal model;complex interconnect structures;electrical modeling;electrical resistance solvers;electrical simulation;equivalent medium;first order isotropic equivalent medium replacement;isotropic thermal conductivity;reliability;thermal simulation","","4","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we model the nonlinear dynamics associated with various chemical reactions in gene-regulatory memory networks using chemical reaction equations. These reaction equations are mapped into a set of electrical-equivalent models and the network is simulated by an extended SPICE-like circuit simulation environment. Furthermore, we address the practical difficulty in direct characterization of network model parameters by developing a simulation-driven Bayesian framework for parameter identification. To ensure the reliable identification of key system properties, we propose a two-step structure-preserving parameter identification approach. The first step infers bistability, the most critical characteristics of a memory device; and the second step is geared towards identifying dynamical properties of the network while maintaining the identified bistability. We demonstrate the proposed approaches through extensive simulations that well agree with established biological understandings and identified networks that recreate measured circuit responses in a statistical sense.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361247","","Application software;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Chemicals;Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Computer applications;Nonlinear equations;Parameter estimation;Predictive models","Bayes methods;SPICE;chemical reactions;integrated circuit modelling;integrated memory circuits;parameter estimation","Bayesian framework;SPICE like circuit simulation;biological information storage;chemical reaction equations;electrical equivalent modeling;electrical equivalent simulation;gene-regulatory memory circuits;nonlinear dynamics;parameter identification","","0","","13","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20091228","2009","","","809","812","Over the years functional hardware verification has made significant progress in the areas of traditional simulation techniques, hardware accelerator usage and last but not least formal verification approaches. This has been sufficient to deal with the additional design content and complexity increase that has been happening at the same time. For POWER7, IBM's first high end 8-core microprocessor, these incremental improvements in verification have been deemed not to be enough by themselves, because the chip was not just a remap of an existing design with more cores. The infrastructure on the chip had to be changed significantly, while at the same time the business side requested a shorter development cycle with perfect quality but without growing the team. Looking at these constraints a two phase approach seemed to be the only solution. This paper commences with the highlights of the first phase, where improvements to the existing process have been identified. This includes topics ranging from enhanced test case generation, over advancements in structural checking to the extensions of the formal verification scope both in property checking and sequential equivalence checking. At the same time, the paper describes the second phase which has targeted the exploitation of synergy across the various verification activities. The active interlock between simulation, formal verification and the design has helped to reduce workload and improved the project schedule. And the usage of coverage in holistic way from unit level simulation to acceleration has led to new innovations and new insight, which improved the overall verification process. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and future trends is given. Categories and Subject Descriptors B.6.3 [Logic Design]: Design Aids - Verification.

Instead of viewing nano-scale characteristics as an impediment, technologies such as PCMOS exploit them as a source of randomness. The technology generates random numbers that are used in probabilistic algorithms. With the PCMOS approach, different voltage levels are used to generate different probability values. If many different probability values are required, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technique for synthesizing logic that generates new probabilities from a given set of probabilities. Three different scenarios are considered in terms of whether the given probabilities can be duplicated and whether there is freedom to choose them. In the case that the given probabilities cannot be duplicated and are predetermined, we provide a solution that is FPGA-mappable. In the case that the given probabilities cannot be duplicated but can be freely chosen, we provide an optimal choice. In the case that the given probabilities can be duplicated and can be freely chosen, we demonstrate how to generate arbitrary decimal probabilities from small sets - a single probability or a pair of probabilities - through combinational logic.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361265","","CMOS technology;Circuit noise;Impedance;Inverters;Noise figure;Probabilistic logic;Random number generation;Semiconductor device noise;Switches;Voltage","combinational circuits;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;probability","CMOS devices;FPGA-mappable;PCMOS approach;combinational logic;decimal probability;nanometer regime;nanoscale characteristics;probabilistic algorithms;synthesizing logic;voltage levels","","0","","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DPL gives rise to two independent, un-correlated distributions of linewidth on a chip, resulting in a `bimodal' linewidth distribution and an increase in performance variation. suggested that new physical design mechanisms could reduce harmful covariance terms that contribute to this performance variation. In this paper, we propose new bimodal-aware timing analysis and optimization methods to improve timing yield of standard-cell based designs that are manufactured using DPL. Our first contribution is a DPL-aware approach to timing modeling, based on detailed analysis of cell layouts. Our second contribution is an ILP-based maximization of `alternate' mask coloring of instances in timing-critical paths, to minimize harmful covariance and performance variation. Third, we propose a dynamic programming-based detailed placement algorithm that solves mask coloring conflicts and can be used to ensure Â¿double patterning correctnessÂ¿ after placement or even after detailed routing, while minimizing the displacement of timing-critical cells with manageable ECO impact.

All the manufactured chips are divided into groups (bins) and each group is assigned its individual supply voltage.

In this paper we present an agent-based power distribution approach (TAPE) which aims to balance the power consumption of a multi/many-core architecture in a pro-active manner. By further taking the system's thermal state into consideration when distributing the power throughout the chip, TAPE is able to noticeably reduce the peak temperature. In our simulation we provide a fair comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches HRTM and PDTM using the MiBench benchmark suite. When running multiple applications simultaneously on a multi/many-core architecture, we are able to achieve an 11.23% decrease in peak temperature compared to the approach that uses no thermal management. At the same time we reduce the execution time (i.e. we increase the performance of the applications) by 44.2% and reduce the energy consumption by 44.4% compared to PDTM.

Nevertheless, such a scheme necessitates high unspecified bit ratios in the original test cubes, resulting in quite significant difficulties in preprocessing test cubes for scan power reduction. The linear mapping from the original cubes to the compressed seeds typically provides extra degrees of flexibility as multiple seeds may reconstruct the test cube. Appreciable power reductions in the decompressed test data can be attained through the pinpointing of the power-optimal seeds during the compression phase. The proposed work explores the aforementioned flexibility in the seed space, and proposes the mathematical and algorithmic framework for a power-aware linear test compression scheme. The proposed technique incurs no hardware overhead over the traditional linear compression scheme; it can be easily embedded furthermore into the industrial test compaction/compression flow.

The problem is first approached by formulating it as an integer linear programming to lay a theoretical foundation. A heuristic approach is proposed, which solves the problem by performing clock skew scheduling for the minimum clock period and gradually converting skew into a combination of retiming and time borrowing.

Such clock distributions are usually highly complex. While the simulation of clock meshes is already time consuming, tuning such networks under tight performance constraints is a more daunting task. In this paper, we address the challenging task of driver size optimization with a goal of skew minimization. The expensive objective function evaluations and difficulty in getting explicit sensitivity information make this problem intractable to standard optimization methods. We propose to explore the recently developed asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPS) method for efficient driver size tuning. While being a search-based method, APPS not only provides the desirable derivative-free optimization capability, but is also amenable to parallelization and possesses appealing theoretically rigorous convergence properties. We show how such a method can lead to powerful parallel sizing optimization of large clock meshes with significant runtime and quality advantages over the traditional sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. We also show how design-specific properties and speeding-up techniques can be exploited to make the optimization even more efficient while maintaining the convergence of APPS in a practical sense.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361244","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Convergence;Design optimization;Microprocessors;Optimization methods;Permission;Quadratic programming;Robustness;Runtime","circuit optimisation;clocks;logic design;quadratic programming","asynchronous parallel pattern search method;clock distributions;clock mesh optimization;clock meshes;driver size tuning;mesh-based clock distribution network;microprocessor designs;parallel pattern search leveraging;sequential quadratic programming method","","0","","8","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, memory bandwidth bottlenecks prevent designs to reach optimal throughput with respect to available parallelism. In this paper we present an automatic memory partitioning technique which can efficiently improve throughput and reduce energy consumption of pipelined loop kernels for given throughput constraints and platform requirement. Our partition scheme consists of two steps, the first step considers cycle accurate scheduling information to meet the hard constraints on memory bandwidth requirements specifically for synchronized hardware designs. Experimental results show an average 6X throughput improvement on a set of real world designs with moderate area increase (about 45% on average), given that less resource sharing opportunities exist with higher throughput in optimized designs. The second step further partitions the memory banks for reducing the dynamic power consumption of the final design. In contrast with previous approaches, our technique can statically compute memory access frequencies in polynomial time with little to none profiling. Experimental results show about 30% power reduction on the same set of benchmarks.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361219","Behavioral Synthesis;Memory Partition","Acceleration;Bandwidth;Costs;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Explosives;Hardware;Kernel;Processor scheduling;Throughput","embedded systems;optimisation;pipeline processing;power aware computing;power consumption;program control structures","automatic memory partitioning;automatic memory scheduling;computation kernels;cycle accurate scheduling information;dynamic power consumption;embedded system design;hardware acceleration;loop pipelining;loop tiling;memory access frequencies;memory bandwidth bottlenecks;nest loops;polynomial time;power optimization;resource sharing opportunities;state-of the art techniques;synchronized hardware designs;throughput optimization","","2","1","18","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional design flow, our approach considers decap impacts at the placement stage to seek the placement minimizing decap requirements while still satisfying the traditional placement objectives. In the new method, we first devise a fast procedure to assess the decap requirement for the force-based placement framework, in which the required decap is modeled as a density function over the chip. Then, we build a corresponding supply and demand system to adjust the placement in favor of minimizing decap. Finally, we develop a decap efficient placement algorithm with a new force induced by imbalance between power supply and power demands.

By exploring the underlying sparse structure in (spatial) frequency domain, VP achieves substantially lower sampling frequency than the well-known (spatial) Nyquist rate. In addition, VP is formulated as a linear programming problem and, therefore, can be solved both robustly and efficiently. Our industrial measurement data demonstrate that by testing the delay of just 50 chips on a wafer, VP accurately predicts the delay of the other 219 chips on the same wafer. In this example, VP reduces the estimation error by up to 10Ã compared to other traditional methods.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361258","Characterization;Integrated Circuit;Process Variation","Compressed sensing;Costs;Delay;Frequency domain analysis;Integrated circuit measurements;Linear programming;Manufacturing processes;Probes;Sampling methods;Silicon","Nyquist criterion;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;linear programming;probes;silicon","Nyquist rate;Si;estimation error;intra-die variations;linear programming problem;minimum cost silicon characterization;nanoscale integrated circuits;nanoscale manufacturing process;sparse structure;spatial correlation;spatial frequency domain;statistically optimal framework;virtual probe","","6","3","23","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ICCAD 2009. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20091228","2009","","","389","396","We present a new projection-based nonlinear model order reduction method, named QLMOR (MOR via quadratic-linear systems). QL-MOR employs two novel ideas: (1) we show that DAEs (differential-algebraic equations) with many commonly-encountered nonlinear kernels can be re-written equivalently into a special format, QL-DAEs (quadratic-linear differential algebraic equations, i.e., DAEs that are quadratic in their state variables and linear in their inputs); (2) we adapt the moment-matching reduction technique of NORM to reduce these QLDAEs into QLDAEs of much smaller size. Because of the generality of the QLDAE form, QLMOR has significantly broader applicability than Taylor-expansion based methods. Importantly, QLMOR, unlike NORM, totally avoids explicit moment calculations (A<sup>i</sup>B terms), hence it has improved numerical stability properties as well. Because the reduced model has only quadratic nonlinearities (i.e., no cubic and higher-order terms), its computational complexity is less than that of similar prior methods. We also prove that QLMOR-reduced models preserve local passivity, and provide an upper bound on the size of the QLDAEs derived from a polynomial system. We compare QLMOR against prior methods on a circuit and a biochemical reaction-like system, and demonstrate that QLMOR-reduced models retain accuracy over a significantly wider range of excitation than Taylor-expansion based methods. Indeed, QLMOR is able to reduce systems that Taylor-expansion based methods fail to reduce due to passivity loss and impractically high computational costs. QLMOR therefore demonstrates that Volterra-kernel based nonlinear MOR techniques can in fact have far broader applicability than previously suspected, possibly being competitive with trajectory-based methods (e.g., TPWL) and nonlinear-projection based methods (e.g., maniMOR).","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361264","","Chemical analysis;Circuits;Differential algebraic equations;Kernel;Nonlinear equations;Nonlinear systems;Permission;Polynomials;Taylor series;Transfer functions","Volterra equations;computational complexity;differential algebraic equations;nonlinear equations;numerical stability;polynomials","-projection based methods;QLMOR-reduced models;Taylor-expansion based methods;Volterra-kernel based nonlinear MOR techniques;biochemical reaction-like system;computational complexity;explicit moment calculations;improved numerical stability properties;moment-matching reduction technique;nonlinear model order reduction;passivity loss;polynomial system;projection-based approach;quadratic-linear differential algebraic equations;trajectory-based methods;upper bound","","3","","25","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Well-managed TSVs alleviate congestion, reduce wirelength, and improve performance, whereas excessive TSVs not only increase the die area, but also have negative impact on many design objectives.

FinFET-based design, however, requires special attention due to its exclusive properties such as width quantization and electrical confinement (quantum-mechanical effect) even in subthreshold regime. Considering these exclusive properties of FinFETs, the sources of process variations and their effects on FinFET-based circuit characteristics can be significantly different from that in bulk CMOS devices. This paper identifies a new source of random process variation due to the gate work-function variation and resulting electrical confinement in emerging high-k/metal-gate FinFET devices. In order to capture the effect of the variations on the characteristics of multifin FinFETs (considering their width quantization property), this paper also presents a new statistical framework to accurately predict the effective threshold voltage of multifin FinFET devices. This framework is subsequently used to predict the leakage profile of FinFET-based SRAM cells. Since FinFETs are optimal for ultra-low-voltage operations due to near-ideal subthreshold swing (60 mV/dec), we focus on FinFET-based SRAM (including subthreshold SRAM) design. Contrary to the low sensitivity of the static noise margin (SNM) to the width of the pull-down devices in bulk-CMOS subthreshold SRAMs, our analysis shows, for the first time, the significant impact of employing multifin pull-down devices on the SNM of subthreshold FinFET SRAMs.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361245","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuits;FinFETs;High K dielectric materials;High-K gate dielectrics;Potential well;Quantization;Random access memory;Random processes","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;SRAM chips;high-k dielectric thin films","FinFET;SRAM cells;bulk CMOS technology;electrical confinement;high-k/metal-gate devices;quantum-mechanical effect;random process variation;static noise margin;ultra-low-voltage operations;width quantization","","1","","42","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To maximize yield rate improvement and to make the problem tractable, we identify a key insight, tolerance-ratio, as an effective guide for choosing insertion patterns and insertion order. Finally, to guarantee yield rate improvement, only positive gain redundant wires are committed. Experimental results show that, compared with unprocessed cases, all yield rate improvements in the proposed algorithm are positive, and the defect rates are reduced by up to 65% and by 24% on average.

The method presented here is similar to the covering algorithm used in multi-level optimizations; however, it is not based on Sum-of-Product form, or any specific input representation. Our experiments show that our approach is not only capable of automatically reproducing some known architectural implementations without any prior knowledge about the functionality of the circuit, but also, in some cases, it is able to discover completely new designs which we have not seen described in literature.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361206","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit analysis;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Digital arithmetic;Input variables;Iterative algorithms;Libraries;Logic circuits","circuit optimisation;logic circuits","arithmetic circuits;hand-optimized arithmetic component libraries;information flow structuring;input circuit structural implementation;iterative layering;logic synthesis algorithm","","0","","19","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An efficient approach for this purpose is post-ATPG test modification based on X-identification and X-filling since it causes no circuit/clock design change and no test vector count inflation. However, applying this approach to test compression has been considered challenging due to the limited availability of X-bits. This paper solves this serious problem by proposing a novel and practical CA (Compression-Aware) test modification scheme for reducing IR-drop in the widely-used broadcast-scan based test compression environment. This unique scheme features (1) CA circuit remodeling for minimizing the effort of applying test modification to broadcast-scan-based test compression, (2) CA X-identification for increasing X-bits for risky test vectors, and (3) CA X-filling for effectively using limited X-bits in reducing IR-drop. As a result, the CA test modification scheme can achieve significant IR-drop reduction even when a test cube only has a small number of X-bits. This advantage is clearly demonstrated by experimental results on three compression configurations created from an industrial circuit.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361307","","Automatic test pattern generation;Broadcasting;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Clocks;Delay;Lab-on-a-chip;Permission;Power supplies;Voltage","automatic test pattern generation;boundary scan testing;network synthesis","At speed scan testing;CA X-identification;IR drop reduction;X-bits limited availability;X-filling;broadcast scan based test compression environment;circuit remodeling;circuit/clock design;compression aware test modification scheme;post ATPG IR drop reduction scheme;post ATPG test modification;test induced yield loss;test vector count inflation","","1","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, utilizing the GPU requires both a change in the programmer's traditional algorithmic model as well as a judicious selection of algorithm being used for the problem. This paper reviews the GPU architecture and the tools available to utilize this valuable resource.

Facing such variations, statistical static timing analysis is introduced to model variations more accurately so that the pessimism in traditional worst case timing analysis is reduced. Because all delays are modeled using correlated random variables, most statistical timing methods are much slower than corner based timing analysis. To speed up statistical timing analysis, we propose a method to extract timing models for flip-flop and latch based sequential circuits respectively. When such a circuit is used as a module in a hierarchical design, the timing model instead of the original circuit is used for timing analysis. The extracted timing models are much smaller than the original circuits. Experiments show that using extracted timing models accelerates timing verification by orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches using flat netlists directly. Accuracy is maintained, however, with the mean and standard deviation of the clock period both showing usually less than 1% error compared to Monte Carlo simulation on a number of benchmark circuits.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361272","","Acceleration;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Delay;Flip-flops;Latches;Random variables;Semiconductor devices;Sequential circuits;Timing","flip-flops;integrated circuit design;sequential circuits;statistical analysis;synchronisation;timing","flip flop;latch;process variation;sequential circuits;statistical timing analysis;timing model extraction","","0","","22","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the past few years, while much research has been aimed at handling parameter variations as part of timing analysis, few proposals have actually included ways to interpret the results of this parameterized static timing analysis (PSTA) step. In this paper, we propose a new post-variational analysis metric that can be used to quantify the (timing) robustness of designs to parameter variations. In addition to helping designers diagnose if and when different nodes can fail, this metric can guide optimization and can give insights on what to fix, by identifying nodes with small robustness values and proceeding to fix those nodes first. Inspired by the rich literature on design centering, tolerancing, and tuning (DCTT), we use distance as a measure for robustness. Our analysis thus determines the minimum distance from the nominal point in the parameter space to any timing violation, and works under the assumption that parameters are specified as ranges rather than statistical distributions. We demonstrate the usefulness of this distance-based robustness metric on circuit blocks extracted from a commercial 45 nm microprocessor.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361289","","Circuits;Delay estimation;Design automation;Microprocessors;Proposals;Robustness;Statistical distributions;Temperature;Timing;Voltage","integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;microprocessor chips;timing","design centering;microprocessor;parameterized static timing analysis;post variational analysis metric;robustness metric;size 45 nm;timing violation","","0","","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme chooses an energy-minimizing set of so-called Special Instructions (considering leakage, dynamic, and reconfiguration energy) and then 'power-gates' a temporarily unused subset of the Special Instruction set. We provide a comprehensive evaluation for different technologies (ranging from 65 nm to 150 nm) and thereby show that our scheme is technology independent, i.e. it is beneficial for various technologies alike. By means of an H.264 video encoder we demonstrate that for certain performance constraints our scheme (applied to our in-house reconfigurable processor) achieves an allover energy saving of up to 40.8% (avg. 24.8%) compared to a performance-maximizing scheme. We also demonstrate that our scheme is equally beneficial to various other state-of-the-art reconfigurable processor architectures like Molen where it achieves energy savings of up to 48.7% (avg. 28.93%) at 65 nm.

Existence of purely imaginary eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix provides useful information in assessing and correcting the passivity of a system. Since direct computation of eigenvalues is very expensive for large-scale systems, several authors have proposed to solve iteratively for a subset of the eigenvalues based on heuristic sampling along the imaginary axis. However, completeness is not guaranteed in such methods and thus potential risk of missing important eigenvalues is difficult to avoid. In this paper we are aiming at finding all eigenvalues efficiently to avoid both the high cost and the potential risk of missing important eigenvalues. The idea of the proposed method is to convert the Hamiltonian matrix to an equivalent sparse form, termed the Â¿extended Hamiltonian pencilÂ¿, and solve for its eigenvalues efficiently using a special eigensolver.

Experiments show that our approach is comparable and often superior to bit-blasting on the core fragment, and that it also helps as a theory layer when applied over the full bit-vector theory.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361322","","Constraint theory;Data structures;Decision feedback equalizers;Encoding;Hardware;NP-complete problem;Permission;Polynomials;Registers;Surface-mount technology","data structures;inference mechanisms;program slicing;program verification","bit-vector slicing;data structures;equality reasoning;fixed-width bit-vector theory;lazy SMT schema;modulo equivalence classes;theory-solver","","0","","23","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a computational framework, referred to as ""Virtual SRAM Fab"", for analyzing and estimating pre-Si SRAM array manufacturing yield considering both lithographic and electrical variations. The framework is being demonstrated for SRAM design/optimization in 45 nm nodes and currently being used for both 32 nm and 22 nm technology nodes. The application and merit of the framework are illustrated using two different SRAM cells in a 45 nm PD/SOI technology, which have been designed for similar stability/performance, but exhibit different parametric yields due to layout/lithographic variations.

As a result, state-of-the-art crosstalk calculators use simplistic and overly pessimistic models resulting in the over-estimation of crosstalk effects. Such pessimism in crosstalk analysis often leads to the triggering of false violations and consequently an inefficient use of design resources. The main contribution of this paper is a novel technique called Timing Arc Based Logic Analysis (TABLA) that serves as an efficient means to calculate realistic crosstalk bounds. TABLA uses timing arcs as basic elements to perform an efficient temporal logic analysis employing the min-max timing model using dedicated solvers for logic and timing. Additionally, a procedure to generate powerful conflict clauses is proposed to improve the run time of the overall analysis.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical floating random walk (HFRW) algorithm for computing the 3D capacitances of a large number of topologically different layout configurations that are all composed of the same layout motifs. Our algorithm is not a standard hierarchical domain decomposition extension of the well established floating random walk technique, but rather a novel algorithm that employs Markov Transition Matrices. Specifically, unlike the fast-multipole boundary element method and hierarchical domain decomposition (which use a far-field approximation to gain computational efficiency), our proposed algorithm is exact and does not rely on any tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency. Instead, it relies on a tradeoff between memory and computational efficiency. Since floating random walk type of algorithms have generally minimal memory requirements, such a tradeoff does not result in any practical limitations. The main practical advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle a set of layout configurations in a complexity that is basically independent of the set size. For instance, in a large 3D layout example, the capacitance calculation of 120 different configurations made of similar motifs is accomplished in the time required to solve independently just 2 configurations, i.e. a 60Ã speedup.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361211","","Capacitance","Markov processes;boundary-elements methods;capacitance;integrated circuit layout","3D capacitance extraction;Markov transition matrices;boundary element method;hierarchical domain decomposition;hierarchical floating random walk algorithm;integrated circuit layout;parasitic extraction;size 22 nm","","1","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Isochrons were instrumental in introducing a notion of generalized phase for an oscillation and form the basis for oscillator perturbation analysis formulations. Calculating the isochrons of an oscillator is a very difficult task. Except for some very simple planar oscillators, isochrons can not be calculated analytically and one has to resort to numerical techniques. Previously proposed numerical methods for computing isochrons can be regarded as brute-force, which become totally impractical for non-planar oscillators with dimension more than two. In this paper, we present a precise and carefully developed theory and advanced numerical techniques for computing local but quadratic approximations for isochrons. Previous work offers the theory and the numerical methods needed for computing only linear approximations for isochrons. Our treatment is general and applicable to oscillators with large dimension.

Besides, some features must be sliced and put onto two masks so that there would be a feasible solution for mask assignment. Such slicing will cause stitches that affect yield. So decomposer needs to minimize their number. In this paper, we formulate the DPT decomposition problem as a maximum cut problem. We propose an extremely efficient two-stage decomposition algorithm called GREMA. The first stage of GREMA generates a set of candidate stitches to ensure that feasible solutions exist for DPT decomposition. The second stage uses maximum cut to find the minimal set of stitches.

These constraints determine both the minimum cell size and supply voltage. RCM is set by the maximum read access time over the array. The randomness of transistor threshold voltages, and thus read times, makes maximum read time follow extreme order statistics, specifically, the Gumbel distribution which is characterized by long tails. Thus, the margin specification needs to be met at the high sigma corners in order to reach acceptable yield, resulting in oversizing and increased VDD. In this work, we demonstrate that a reduced-area bitcell design is achievable by reducing the impact of intra-array randomness through a new architecture that employs an adaptive voltage scheme in a partitioned SRAM array. The key idea is to be able to shift empirical distributions (realizations) of read time in a set of rows that form a single partition to meet the target. Because the partition is smaller than the whole array, the tail of the Gumbel distribution is significantly reduced. The adaptive voltage tuning policy is driven by the worst partition access time. For the blocks whose delay violates access time constraints, a higher voltage is selected out of the available set to gain yield, otherwise voltage is reduced for power saving. This permits smaller cell area and lower V<sub>DD</sub> at identical yield. The cost of adaptivity is in generation and routing of a small number (in our experiments, four) voltage levels and the area of one-per-partition set of PMOS switches. We demonstrate that through the voltage tuning architecture we propose, it is possible to obtain mean power consumption reduction on average by 21% iso-area. Alternatively, bitcell area can be reduced on average by 7% iso-power compared to the existing design strategy.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361227","","Adaptive arrays;Costs;Delay effects;Energy efficiency;Probability distribution;Random access memory;Routing;Statistical distributions;Threshold voltage;Time factors","SRAM chips;integrated circuit design;logic arrays","Gumbel distribution;adaptive voltage architecture;empirical distribution;intra array SRAM variability;mean power consumption reduction;read current margin;reduced area bitcell design;static noise margin;voltage tuning;write margin","","0","1","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20091228","2009","","","314","320","Multi-core processors have become an integral part of mainstream high performance computer systems. In parallel, exponentially increasing power density and packaging costs have necessitated system level thermal management solutions for multi-core systems. Dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques monitor on-chip temperature continuously and typically employs dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to lower the temperature when it exceeds a pre-defined threshold. State-of-the-art DTM solutions for multi-core systems include distributed DVFS (where each core can scale the voltage/ frequency individually) and global DVFS (where all cores scale voltage/frequency simultaneously). Distributed DVFS generally offers higher performance than global DVFS, but it is hard to implement and has major scalability issues. We propose a hybrid local-global thermal management approach for multi-core systems that offers better performance than distributed DVFS, while maintaining the simplicity of global DVFS. We employ global DVFS across all the cores but locally tune the performance of each core individually through architectural adaptations. We exploit easily reconfigurable micro-architecture parameters such as instruction window size, issue width, and fetch throttling in per-core thermal management. Our hybrid solution is easy to implement and highly effective towards temperature management.

For thermal problem, two possible solutions exist: thermal-through-silicon-vias (T-TSVs) and micro-fluidic channel (MFC) based liquid cooling. In case of power delivery, a highly complex power distribution network is required to deliver currents reliably to all parts of the 3D stacked IC while suppressing the power supply noise to an acceptable level. However, these thermal and power networks pose major challenges in signal routability and congestion. This is because the signal, power, and thermal interconnects are all competing for routing space. In this paper, we present a co-optimization methodology for the signal, power, and thermal interconnects for 3D stacked ICs based on design of experiments (DOE) and response surface method (RSM). The goal is to improve performance, thermal, noise, and congestion metrics with our holistic approach. We also provide in-depth comparison between T-TSV and MFC based cooling method and discuss how to employ DOE and RSM to best co-optimize the multi-functional interconnects simultaneously.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361228","3D stacked IC;design of experiments;micro-fluidic channel;through-silicon-via","Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit noise;Liquid cooling;Noise level;Power supplies;Routing;Semiconductor device noise;Signal design;Thermal management;US Department of Energy","design of experiments;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;microfluidics;optimisation","3D stacked integrated circuit technology;design of experiments;heat removal;integrated circuit reliability;microfluidic channel;multifunctional interconnect co-optimization;power delivery;power supply noise;response surface method;signal congestion;signal routability;thermal interconnection;thermal through silicon vias","","5","","10","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus it is appealing to study the potential of GPU for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications. However, EDA generally involves irregular data structures such as sparse matrix and graph operations, which pose significant challenges for efficient GPU implementations. In this paper, we propose high-performance GPU implementations for two important irregular EDA computing patterns, Sparse-Matrix Vector Product (SMVP) and graph traversal. On a wide range of EDA problem instances, our SMVP implementations outperform all published work and achieve a speedup of one order of magnitude over the CPU baseline. Upon such a basis, both timing analysis and linear system solution can be considerably accelerated. We also introduce a SMVP based formulation for Breadth-First Search and observe considerable speedup on GPU implementations.

The overall yield of 3D ICs improves with pre-bond testability because designers can avoid stacking defective dies with good ones. However, pre-bond testability presents unique challenges to 3D clock tree design. First, each die needs a complete 2D clock tree for the pre-bond testing. In addition, the entire 3D stack needs a complete 3D clock tree for post-bond testing and normal operations. In the case of two-die stack, a straightforward solution is to have two complete 2D clock trees connected with a single Through-Silicon-Via (TSV). We show that this solution suffers from long wirelength and high clock power consumption. Instead, our algorithm minimizes the overall wirelength and clock power consumption while providing the pre-bond testability and post-bond operability under given skew and slew constraints. Compared with the single-TSV solution, SPICE simulation results show that our multi-TSV approach significantly reduces the clock power by up to 15.9% for two-die and 29.7% for four-die stack.

In this paper, we propose Early Write Termination (EWT), a novel technique to significantly reduce write energy with no performance penalty. EWT can be implemented with low complexity and low energy overhead. Our evaluation shows that up to 80% of write energy reduction can be achieved through EWT, resulting 33% less total energy consumption, and 34% reduction in ED<sup>2</sup>.

In this paper, we formulate and solve the binning optimization problem that decides the bin boundaries and their testing order to maximize the benefit (considering the test cost) for a transparently-latched circuit. The problem is decomposed into three sub-problems which are solved sequentially. First, to compute the clock period distribution of the transparently-latched circuit, a sample-based SSTA approach is developed which is based on the generalized stochastic collocation method (gSCM) with Sparse Grid technique. The minimal clock period on each sample point is found by solving a minimal cycle ratio problem in the constraint graph. Second, a greedy algorithm is proposed to maximize the sales profit by iteratively assigning each boundary to its optimal position. Then, an optimal algorithm of O(n log n) runtime is used to generate the optimal testing order of bin boundaries to minimize the test cost, based on alphabetic tree. Experiments on all the ISCAS'89 sequential benchmarks with 65-nm technology show 6.69% profit improvement and 14.00% cost reduction in average. The results also demonstrate that the proposed SSTA method achieves an error of 0.70% and speedup of 110X in average compared with the Monte Carlo simulation.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361271","Binning Optimization;Latched Circuits;SSTA","Circuit testing;Clocks;Cost function;Distributed computing;Greedy algorithms;Grid computing;Latches;Marketing and sales;Microprocessors;Stochastic processes","Monte Carlo methods;circuit optimisation;computational complexity;graph theory;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit manufacture;microprocessor chips;stochastic processes","Monte Carlo simulation;SSTA;alphabetic tree;bin boundaries;binning optimization;clock period distribution;constraint graph;fabricated chips;generalized stochastic collocation method;greedy algorithm;high performance microprocessors;minimal clock period;minimal cycle ratio;optimal testing;sales profit;sparse grid technique;testing order;transparent latches;transparently-latched circuits","","0","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To handle this problem, existing power delivery aware placement algorithms model voltage drops as an optimization objective. We observe that directly minimizing voltage drops in an objective function might not resolve voltage-drop violations and might even cause problems in power-integrity convergence. To remedy this deficiency, in this paper, we propose new techniques to incorporate device power spreading forces into a mixed-size analytical placement framework. Unlike the state-of-the-art previous work that handles the worst voltage-drop spots one by one, our approach simultaneously and globally spreads all the blocks with voltage-drop violations to desired locations directly to minimize the violations. To apply the power force, we model macro current density and power rails for our placement framework to derive desired macro/cell locations. To further improve the solution quality, we propose an efficient mathematical transformation to adjust the power force direction and magnitude.

Thus, for DC as well as fixed time-step based transient and periodic steady state (PSS) simulation formulations, the solutions produced by the solver are formal in nature.

Previous routability-driven placement techniques are usually tightly coupled with the underlying placers. So usually they cannot be easily integrated into various placement tools. In this paper, we propose a tool called CROP (Congestion Refinement of Placement) for mixed-size placement solutions. CROP is independent of any placer. It takes a legalized placement solution and then relocates the modules to improve routability without significantly disturbing the original placement solution. CROP interleaves a congestion-driven module shifting technique and a congestion-driven detailed placement technique. Basically the shifting technique targets at better allocating the routing resources. Shifting in each direction can be formulated as a linear program (LP) for resizing each G-Cell. Instead of solving the computationally expensive LP, we discover that the LP formulation could be relaxed and solved by a very efficient longest-path computation. Then the congestion-driven detailed placement technique is proposed to better distribute the routing demands. Congestion reduction is realized by weighting the HPWL with congestion coefficient during detailed placement. The experimental results show that CROP is capable of effectively alleviating the congestion for unroutable placement solutions. We apply it to placement solutions generated by four different placers on the ISPD05/06 placement benchmarks. Within a very short runtime, CROP greatly improves the routability and saves execution time for the routing stage after refinement.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361269","","Coupling circuits;Crops;Design engineering;Lagrangian functions;Permission;Resource management;Routing;Runtime;White spaces;Wire","CAD;linear programming;network routing","CROP;G-cell resizing;congestion refinement of placement;congestion-driven detailed placement technique;congestion-driven module shifting technique;linear program;longest-path computation;mixed-size placement solutions;routing resources","","3","2","21","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Circuit optimization is then tuned to the worst-case conditions to guarantee error-free computation but may also lead to very inefficient designs. Recently, there are processor works that over-clock the chip to achieve higher performance to the point where timing errors occur, and then error correction is performed either through circuit-level or microarchitecture-level techniques. This approach in general is referred to as Timing Speculation. In this paper, we propose a new circuit optimization technique ""DynaTune"" for timing speculation based on the dynamic behavior of a circuit. DynaTune optimizes the most dynamically critical gates of a circuit and improves the circuit's throughput under a fixed power budget. We test this proposed technique with two timing speculation schemes-Telescopic Unit (TU) and Razor Logic (RZ). Experimental results show that applying DynaTune on the Leon3 processor can increase the throughput of critical modules by up to 13% and 20% compared to the timing-speculative and non-timing-speculative results optimized by Synopsys Design Compiler, respectively. For MCNC benchmark circuits, DynaTune combined with TU can provide 9% and 20% throughput gains on average compared to timing-speculative and non-timing-speculative results optimized by Design Compiler. When combined with RZ, DynaTune can achieve 8% and 15% throughput gains on average for above experiments.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361295","BDD;Timing speculation;dual threshold voltage;logic synthesis;performance;throughput;timing analysis","Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Design optimization;Error correction;Logic testing;Microarchitecture;Optimizing compilers;Throughput;Timing","critical path analysis;network synthesis;optimisation;parallel programming;timing","circuit level optimization;circuit optimization technique;dynamic path behavior;dynatune;error free computation;fixed power budget;microarchitecture level techniques;non timing speculative results;over clock chip;razor logic;speculation schemes telescopic unit;static critical paths;synopsys design compiler;timing speculation;timing speculative;traditional circuit design;worst case conditions","","3","","15","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to enable more aggressive leakage reduction, researchers are seeking ways to control leakage with finer granularity. Our research proposes two novel methods, namely circuit clustering for temporal and spatial idleness exploitation, to systematically reduce the granularity of leakage control and improve leakage reduction. Another strength of this paper is the quantitative study of leakage saving and control cost by leakage control with different granularity. With our quantitative study, designers can make the trade-off between leakage saving and control cost, and decide the optimum granularity for leakage control. A heuristic algorithm has been developed to automate the two circuit clustering methods and determine the optimum granularity for any given circuit. The analysis and experiments of this paper is mainly based on RBB. They are also applicable to PG by modifying the cost function.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361251","Leakage control;body biasing;granularity;idleness exploitation;power gating","Automatic control;Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Control systems;Cost function;Energy consumption;Optimal control;Runtime;Tuned circuits","heuristic programming;integrated circuit modelling;leakage currents","body biasing;circuit clustering;cost function;heuristic algorithm;leakage reduction;optimal grained leakage control;optimum granularity;power gating;runtime leakage control;spatial idleness exploitation;temporal idleness exploitation","","0","","15","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such networks are prone to premature failure because some nodes deplete their batteries more rapidly than others due to workload variations, non-uniform communication, and heterogeneous hardware. Many-to-one traffic patterns are common in sensor networks, further increasing node power consumption heterogeneity. Most previous sensor network lifetime enhancement techniques focused on balancing power distribution, based on the assumption of uniform battery capacity allocation among homogeneous nodes. This paper gives a formulation and solution to the cost-constrained lifetime-aware battery allocation problem for sensor networks with arbitrary topologies and heterogeneous power distributions. An integer nonlinear programming formulation is given. Based on an energy-cost battery pack model and optimal node partitioning algorithm, a rapid battery pack selection heuristic is developed and its deviation from optimality is quantified. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique achieves network lifetime improvements ranging from 3-11Ã compared to uniform battery allocation, with no more than 10 battery pack energy levels. The proposed technique achieves 2-5 orders of magnitude speedup compared to a general-purpose commercial nonlinear program solver, solution quality improves, and little approximation error is observed.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361220","Battery Allocation;Lifetime;Wireless Sensor Network","Batteries;Capacitive sensors;Costs;Data acquisition;Energy consumption;Hardware;Network topology;Power distribution;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","cells (electric);power supplies to apparatus;wireless sensor networks","battery pack;cost constraint;lifetime aware battery allocation;nonlinear program solver;wireless sensor network lifetime maximization","","0","","23","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The drifts of the sampling distribution are re-configured in each iteration toward further minimization of the estimation variance by using the data obtained from the previous circuit simulations and applying a high-order Householder's method. Secondly, an analytical framework is developed and integrated with the adaptive sampler to further boost the efficiency of the method. This is achieved by the optimal initialization of the alternative multi-variate Gaussian distribution via setting its drift vector and covariance matrix.

While current approaches for defining design rules are largely unsystematic and empirical in nature, this paper offers a novel framework for early and systematic evaluation of design rules and layout styles in terms of major layout characteristics of area, manufacturability, and variability. Due to the focus on co-exploration in early stages of technology development, we use first order models of variability and manufacturability (instead of relying on accurate simulation) and layout topology/congestion-based area estimates (instead of explicit and slow layout generation). The framework is used to efficiently co-evaluate several debatable rules (evaluation for a 104-cell library takes 20 minutes). Results show that: a) diffusion-rounding mainly from diffusion power-straps is a dominant source of variability, b) cell-area overhead of fixed gate-pitch implementation compared to 1D-poly implementation is tolerable (5%) given the improvement in variability, and c) 1D-poly restriction, which improves manufacturability and variability, has almost no area overhead compared to 2D-poly. In addition, we explore gate-spacing rules using our evaluation framework. This exploration yields almost identical values as those of a commercial 65 nm process, which serves as a validation for our approach.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361232","","Circuits;Contracts;Design methodology;Libraries;Lithography;Permission;Productivity;Pulp manufacturing;Topology;Virtual manufacturing","integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit manufacture","cell area overhead;debatable rule;design rule evaluation;diffusion rounding;gate spacing rule;layout styles;size 65 nm","","0","","41","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate these problems, we develop OS scheduling techniques that are aware of online self-test, and schedule/migrate tasks in multi-core systems by taking into account the unavailability of one or more cores undergoing online self-test. These techniques eliminate any performance degradation and perceptible delays in soft real-time and interactive applications (otherwise introduced by online self-test), and significantly reduce the impact of online self-test on the performance of computation-intensive applications.

In the presented approach, a two-stage macromodel that creates broadband, accurate parametric representations of passives, in particular spiral inductors, is developed. The broadband nature is captured through the Vector Fitting algorithm. The macromodels are implemented via efficient nonlinear, multidimensional regression using Relevance Vector Machine, and are coupled into circuit simulators through admittance parameters. Subsequently, optimization on both active and passive parameters are carried out simultaneously, thereby bypassing the ad hoc nature of two stage (actives and passives) approximate optimization.

DPT decomposes a layout into two masks and applies double exposure patterning to increase the pitch size and thus printability. In this paper, we present the first algorithm in the literature for the simultaneous layout migration and decomposition (SMD) problem. Our algorithm first constructs a conflict graph and DPT-aware constraint graphs, and then applies integer linear programming (ILP) corresponding to the graphs to obtain a decomposed and migrated layout. We further present an effective graph-based reduction technique to prune the ILP solution space, which maintains the same DPT conflicts. We also present a new DPT-aware objective for the SMD problem to minimize the difference between the original and migrated layouts while considering the DPT effects. In addition, we present an approach to generate DPT-aware standard cells by considering the DPT effects on the cell boundaries; this technique improves the layout printability and facilitates EDA tools to consider DPT. Experimental results show that our algorithms can effectively generate conflict-free migrated layouts with 14% smaller layout areas and 28% smaller layout changes, compared with the traditional method of layout decomposition followed by layout migration. In particular, our reduction technique can reduce the runtimes for the test cases from more than one day for the basic ILP formulation to only seconds. can reduce the runtimes for the test cases from more than one day to only seconds.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361233","","Design engineering;Electronic design automation and methodology;Integer linear programming;Libraries;Lithography;Manufacturing;Production;Productivity;Runtime;Testing","decomposition;electronic design automation;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit technology;linear programming","DPT aware constraint graphs;DPT aware standard cells;EDA tools;conflict free migrated layouts;double patterning technology;electronic design automation;integer linear programming;layout decomposition;layout printability;simultaneous layout migration","","8","2","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the non-uniform stress distribution in the channel, the enhancement in carrier mobility, velocity, and threshold voltage shift strongly depend on circuit layout, leading to systematic performance variations among transistors. A compact stress model that physically captures this behavior is essential to bridge the process technology with design optimization. In this paper, starting from the first principle, a new layout-dependent stress model is proposed as a function of layout, temperature, and other device parameters. Furthermore, a method of layout decomposition is developed to partition the layout into a set of simple patterns for efficient model extraction. These solutions significantly reduce the complexity in stress modeling and simulation. They are comprehensively validated by TCAD simulation and published Si-data, including the state-of-the-art strain technologies and the STI stress effect. By embedding them into circuit analysis, the interaction between layout and circuit performance is well benchmarked at 45 nm node.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361246","Layout Dependence;Mobility;Pattern Decomposition;Stress Effect;Stress Modeling","Bridge circuits;CMOS technology;Capacitive sensors;Circuit simulation;Design optimization;Fabrication;Integrated circuit technology;Semiconductor device modeling;Stress;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;carrier mobility;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;technology CAD (electronics)","CMOS design;CMOS fabrication;STI stress effect;TCAD simulation;carrier mobility enhancement;carrier transport properties;circuit analysis;circuit layout;compact stress model;design optimization;efficient model extraction;layout decomposition;layout-dependent stress effect;layout-dependent stress model;non-uniform stress distribution;pattern decomposition;process technology;strain technology;stress modeling;threshold voltage shift","","3","","35","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Threshold voltage (vt) assignment has been extensively studied, due to its effectiveness in leakage power reduction. In contrast to the efficiently solvable continuous vt assignment problem, the discrete vt assignment problem is known to be NP-hard. All of the existing techniques are heuristics without performance guarantee due to the NP-hardness nature of the problem. It is still not known whether there is any rigorous approximation algorithm for the discrete vt assignment problem. In this paper, the first Â¿-approximation algorithm is designed for the discrete vt assignment problem. The algorithm can Â¿-approximate the optimal vt assignment solution in O(mn<sup>3</sup> log n log 1/Â¿ + mn<sup>3</sup> log<sup>2</sup> 1/Â¿ ÷ Â¿<sup>2</sup>) time, where n is the size of the combinational circuit and m is the number of available threshold voltages per gate. It is based on an advanced potential function technique and an efficient dual decision core query technique. Our experiments on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits demonstrate that the new algorithm always returns a solution with error bounded by e even compared to the lower bound of the optimal solution. On average, it can approximate the optimal solution with 2.8% additional leakage power running in 51.3 seconds, while the integer linear programming technique is computationally prohibitive. Our algorithm also significantly outperforms the heuristic in by 16.5% leakage power saving with similar runtime. This clearly demonstrates the practicality of the proposed Â¿-approximation algorithm for the vt assignment problem.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361280","∊-Approximation;Leakage Power;NP-Complete;VT Assignment","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Design engineering;Design optimization;Distributed computing;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Threshold voltage;Timing;Very large scale integration","CAD;VLSI;combinational circuits;computational complexity;linear programming;minimisation","ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits;NP-hard problem;VLSI;advanced potential function technique;combinational circuit;discrete VT assignment;dual decision core query technique;epsilon-approximation;integer linear programming;leakage power minimization;threshold voltage","","0","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ICCAD 2009. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20091228","2009","","","47","54","In a behavioral synthesis system, a typical approach used to guide the scheduler is to impose hard constraints on the relative timing between operations considering performance, area, power, etc., so that the resulting RTL design is favorable in these aspects. The mechanism is often flawed in practice because many such constraints are actually soft constraints which are not necessary, and the constraint system may become inconsistent when many hard constraints are added for different purposes. This paper describes a scheduler that distinguishes soft constraints from hard constraints when exploring the design space. We propose a special class of soft constraints called integer-difference soft constraints, which lead to a totally unimodular constraint matrix in an integer linear programming formulation. By exploiting the total unimodularity, the problem can be solved optimally and efficiently using a linear programming relaxation without expensive branch and bound procedures. We also show how the proposed method can be used to support a variety of design considerations. As an example application, we apply the method to the problem of low-power synthesis with operation gating. In a set of experiments on real-world designs, our method achieves an average of 33.9% reduction in total power; it outperforms a previous method by 17.1% on average and gives close-to-optimal solutions on several designs.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361315","","Algorithm design and analysis;Frequency estimation;Integer linear programming;Integrated circuit synthesis;Integrated circuit technology;Permission;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Space exploration;Timing","constraint handling;linear programming","RTL design;behavioral synthesis system;constraint system;exploring design space;hard constraints;impose hard constraints;integer difference soft constraints;integer linear programming formulation;low power synthesis operation gating;mechanism flawed practice;relative timing operations;soft constraints scheduling;unimodular constraint matrix","","1","1","30","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that not only practically meaningful applications of final-value ODE problems exist, but also the inherent stability challenges may be addressed by recently proposed numerical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate an elegant bi-directional parallel circuit simulation scheme, where one time-domain simulation task is sped up by simultaneously solving initial and final-value ODEs, one from each end of the time axis.

For this reason, a number of reliability-aware power management (RA-PM) schemes were recently proposed to preserve the system reliability when DVS is used. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called the shared recovery (SHR) technique, to minimize the system-level energy consumption while still preserving the system's original reliability. The main idea of the SHR technique is to avoid the offline allocation of separate recovery tasks to the scaled tasks by assigning a global/shared recovery block that can be used by any task at run-time. Our simulation results show that, compared to the existing RA-PM schemes, our scheme can achieve up to 35% energy savings. Further, this performance is shown to be comparable to the maximum energy savings that can be achieved by any algorithm. Interestingly, our extensive evaluation indicates that SHR offers also non-trivial gains over the previous algorithms on the reliability side. Further, a dynamic extension is proposed to improve energy and reliability management at run-time by reducing the size of the recovery block and re-using the slack that arises from early completions.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361313","","Computer science;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency;Operating systems;Power system management;Power system reliability;Runtime;Voltage control","energy consumption;energy management systems;power aware computing","dynamic voltage scaling;energy management;enhanced reliability-aware power management;shared recovery technique;system reliability;system-level energy consumption","","0","","28","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This trend leads to potential vulnerabilities from untrusted circuit foundries to covertly implant malicious hardware trojans into a genuine design. Hardware trojans provide back doors for on-chip manipulation, or leak secret information off-chip once the compromised IC is deployed in the field. This paper explores the design space of hardware Trojans and proposes a novel technique, Â¿Malicious Off-chip Leakage Enabled by Side-channelsÂ¿ (MOLES), which employs power side-channels to convey secret information off-chip. An experimental MOLES circuit is designed with fewer than 50 gates and is embedded into an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic circuit in a predictive 45 nm CMOS technology model. Engineered by a spread-spectrum technique, the MOLES technique is capable of leaking multi-bit information below the noise power level of the host IC to evade evaluators' detections. In addition, a generalized methodology for a class of MOLES circuits and design verification by statistical correlation analysis are presented. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the potential threats of MOLES on embedded system security. Nevertheless, MOLES could be constructively used for hardware authentication, fingerprinting and IP protection.","1092-3152","978-1-60558-800-1","978-1-60558-800-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361303","","CMOS technology;Cryptography;Economic forecasting;Electronics industry;Fabrication;Foundries;Hardware;Integrated circuit noise;Power generation economics;Space exploration","CMOS digital integrated circuits;cryptography;industrial property;integrated circuit design","Advanced Encryption Standard cryptographic circuit;CMOS technology;IP protection;MOLES;fingerprinting;hardware authentication;hardware trojans;malicious hardware;malicious off-chip leakage enabled by side channels;on chip manipulation;size 45 nm;spread spectrum technique;untrusted circuit","","4","","26","","","2-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
