"An energy and deadline aware resource provisioning, scheduling and optimization framework for cloud systems","Yue Gao; Yanzhi Wang; Gupta, S.K.; Pedram, M.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Profit maximization for the cloud service provider (CSP) is a key objective in the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-user environment of a cloud system. This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the operation cost of a cloud system by maximizing its energy efficiency while ensuring that user deadlines as defined in Service Level Agreements are met. The workload in the cloud system can be modeled as independent batch requests or as task graphs with dependencies. This paper adopts the latter modeling approach, which provides more opportunities for energy and performance optimizations, thus enabling the CSP to meet user deadlines at lower operation costs. However, these optimizations require additional supporting efforts e.g., resource provisioning, virtual machine placement, and task scheduling, which are addressed in a holistic manner in the proposed framework. In the envisioned cloud environment, users can construct their own services and applications based on the available set of virtual machines, but are relieved from the burden of resource provisioning and task scheduling. The CSP will then exploit data parallelism in user workloads to create an energy and deadline-aware cloud platform.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659018","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Schedules;Servers","cloud computing;contracts;power aware computing;profitability;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","CSP;cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud systems;data parallelism;deadline aware resource provisioning;deadline-aware cloud platform;energy aware resource provisioning;energy efficiency;energy-aware cloud platform;energy-efficient computing;heterogeneous environment;large-scale environment;multiuser environment;optimization framework;profit maximization;scheduling framework;service level agreements;task scheduling;user workloads;virtual machine placement","","3","","41","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Reducing inter-core cache contention with an adaptive bank mapping policy in DRAM cache","Hameed, F.; Bauer, L.; Henkel, J.","Dept. of Embedded Syst., Karlsruhe Inst. of Technol.

Recent research has demonstrated the benefits of high capacity on-chip DRAM cache that leads to reduced off-chip accesses. However, state-of-the-art has not taken into consideration the cache access patterns of concurrently running heterogeneous applications that can cause inter-core cache contention. We therefore propose an adaptive bank mapping policy in response to the diverse requirements of applications with different cache access behaviors that - as a result - reduces inter-core cache contention in DRAM-based cache architectures. On average, our adaptive bank mapping policy increases the harmonic mean instruction-per-cycle throughput by 19.3% (max. 71%) compared to state-of-the-art bank mapping policies.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658988","","Arrays;Bismuth;Indexes;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Round robin;Vectors","DRAM chips;cache storage;integrated circuit design","DRAM-based cache architectures;adaptive bank mapping policy;cache access patterns;harmonic mean instruction-per-cycle throughput;inter-core cache contention;memory bandwidth;on-chip DRAM cache","","0","","17","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic refinement of requirements for verification throughout the SoC design flow","Pierre, L.; Bel Hadj Amor, Z.","TIMA Lab., UJF, Grenoble, France","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","10","This paper focuses on the verification of requirements for hardware/software systems on chip (SoC's) along the design flow. In the early stages of this flow, the Electronic System Level (ESL) description style, and languages such as SystemC TLM, enable high-level debugging of the SoC functionality. In the last stages, hardware blocks become RTL or gate level (VHDL or Verilog) descriptions. We have developed two autonomous Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) solutions, for SystemC TLM platforms and for VHDL/Verilog IP blocks: designs are automatically instrumented with ad hoc property checkers produced from requirements formalized as PSL assertions. Furthermore, for a comprehensive and seamless verification flow, analogous requirements should be verifiable before and after ESL-to-RTL hardware refinement. This requires the transformation of ESL assertions into their counterparts at the RT level. This paper discusses this issue and proposes a first set of transformation rules for the automatic refinement of PSL assertions from the system level to the signal level. Properties of an industrial case study are used as illustrative examples.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659016","","Hardware;Program processors;Registers;Synchronization;System-on-chip;Time-domain analysis;Time-varying systems","formal verification;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;logic circuits;logic design;system-on-chip","ABV;ESL assertion transformation;ESL description style;ESL-to-RTL hardware refinement;PSL assertions;SoC design flow;SoC functionality;SystemC TLM languages;SystemC TLM platform;VHDL IP blocks;VHDL descriptions;Verilog IP blocks;Verilog descriptions;ad hoc property checker;automatic requirement refinement;autonomous assertion-based verification;comprehensive verification flow;electronic system level description;gate level descriptions;hardware blocks;hardware-software systems on chip;high-level debugging;industrial case study;requirement verification;seamless verification flow;signal level;transformation rules","","0","","31","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic generation of compact formal properties for effective error detection","Bertasi, M.; Di Guglielmo, G.; Pravadelli, G.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Verona, Verona, Italy","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","10","Several approaches exist in literature for automatic extraction of model behaviours represented in the form of formal properties. Some of them rely on static analysis of the source code, others dynamically mine specifications by analysing simulation traces. In both cases, most of them work at bit level and generate properties in the form of combinational or temporal relationships among Boolean expressions. Such techniques are suited only for gate-level or RTL HW models. There are also approaches working on system-level descriptions and SW programs, but they generate properties to express only the sequential ordering of communication function calls and events, while the functional part of the implementation is ignored. To fill in the gap, this paper presents a dynamic methodology that works on gate-level, RTL and system-level HW descriptions as well as embedded SW, independently from the design model and the abstraction level. The generated properties are in the form of temporal relationships among arithmetic and logic expressions involving traditional HW description language data types (i.e., bit and logic vectors) as well as data types typically adopted in system-level models and SW programs (i.e., integer, double and string). A ranking function is also defined to classify the mined properties according to their capability of capturing meaningful design behaviours. Experimental results have shown that the approach allows generating compact properties really useful to effectively detect errors in the design implementation.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659015","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data mining;Educational institutions;Logic gates;Protocols","data mining;formal specification","Boolean expressions;RTL HW model;RTL descriptions;combinational relationships;compact formal properties;embedded software;error detection;gate-level descriptions;gate-level model;ranking function;simulation traces analysis;software programs;source code static analysis;system-level descriptions;system-level hardware descriptions;temporal relationships","","0","","31","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tree nodes migrate between DRAM and flash memory, as needed, in response to user access pattern so as to optimize the performance and to reduce managing overhead.

Software Managed Multicore (SMM) architectures are one of the promising solutions. In an SMM architecture, there are no caches, and each core has only a local scratchpad memory. If all the code and data of the task mapped to a core do not fit on its local scratchpad memory, then explicit code and data management is required. In this paper, we solve the problem of efficiently managing code on an SMM architecture. We extend the state of the art by: i) correctly calculating the code management overhead, ii) even in the presence of branches in the task, and iii) developing a heuristic CMSM (Code Mapping for Software Managed multicores) that results in efficient code management execution on the local scratchpad memory. Our experimental results collected after executing applications from MiBench suite [1] on the Cell SPEs (Cell is an SMM architecture) [2], demonstrate that correct management cost calculation and branch consideration can improve performance by 12%. Our heuristic CMSM can reduce runtime in more than 80% of the cases, and by up to 20% on our set of benchmarks.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658998","Code;SPM;embedded systems;instruction;local memory;multi-core processor;scratchpad memory","Estimation;Interference;Memory management;Multicore processing;Software;Switches","multiprocessing systems;storage management","Cell SPE;SMM architecture;branch consideration;code management;code mapping for software managed multicores;data management;heuristic CMSM;management cost calculation;scratchpad memory;software managed multicores","","0","","22","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting with a variants system specification including a set of task graphs, linear constraints on binary variables are specified for their alternative selection as well as the selection of groups of alternatives called application groups. These constraints may stem from a certain domain knowledge, e. g., entertainment or power train domain, or global constraints. The typically vast space of resulting possible combinations of different selections of alternative behaviors will be termed variant space and those satisfying the set of formulated constraints valid variants. An important result of this paper is that the set of variants, and especially the set of valid variants, do not need to be modeled or stored explicitly but rather implicitly. Nevertheless do we show that using state-of-the-art PB solver techniques, we may determine the set of valid variants very efficiently. Each of these valid variants may subsequently be used as a candidate for design space exploration (DSE) in order to optimize also the mapping of the corresponding task graph functionalities to a final optimized E/E architecture. A real-world case study is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and efficiency of the presented approach on implicit variant modeling and analysis.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659011","","Automotive engineering;Business;Computer architecture;Hardware;Sensors;Software;Space exploration","automotive electronics;design engineering;embedded systems;graph theory;mechanical engineering computing","DSE;IVaM;PB solver techniques;automotive embedded systems;design space exploration;electric-and-electronic architecture functionality;electronic control units;functional variant analysis;functional variant modeling;global business knowledge;graph-based approach;group selection;implicit variant modeling-and-management;linear constraints;local technical expert knowledge;task graph functionalities","","2","","14","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this observation we present a new system architecture for implementing DIFT, and also describe wrappers that provide DIFT functionality for third-party IP components. Results show that our implementation minimally impacts performance of programs that do not utilize DIFT, and the price of security is constant for modest amounts of tagging and then sub-linearly increases with the amount of tagging.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658991","Dynamic Information Flow Tracking;Hardware accelerators;Heterogeneous designs;Network-on-Chip;Security;System-on-Chip","Computer architecture;Engines;Hardware;Security;Software;System-on-chip;Tagging","embedded systems;network-on-chip","DIFT functionality;WHISK;dynamic information flow tracking;heterogeneous embedded SoC;holistic platform level;network-on-chip;onchip accelerators;third-party IP components;uncore architecture","","0","","23","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intend of this paper is to present problems and solutions of top research initiatives from diverse angles with the common denominator of the dire need for run-time adaption: The first part tackles the thermal problem i.e. high power densities and the related short and long-term effects it has on the reliability and it presents scalable techniques to cope the related problems. The second section demonstrates the potential of steep slope devices on thread scheduling of multi-cores. The third approach presents embedded pipelined architectures running complex multi-media applications whereas the fourth section introduces the paradigm of invasive computing i.e. a novel computing approach promising high efficiency through a highly-adaptive hardware/software architecture.

Widespread chronic diseases such as diabetes constitute a significant cause of rising healthcare costs. Despite the increased need for smart healthcare systems that monitor patients' body balance, there is no coherent theory that facilitates the design and optimization of efficient and robust cyber physical systems. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for capturing the dynamics of blood glucose characteristics (e.g., time dependent fractal behavior) observed in real world measurements via fractional calculus concepts. Building on our time dependent fractal model, we propose a novel mathematical model as well as hardware architecture for an artificial pancreas that relies on solving a constrained multi-fractal optimal control problem for regulating insulin injection. We verify the accuracy of our mathematical model by comparing it to conventional nonfractal models using real world measurements and showing that the nonlinear optimal controller based on fractal calculus concepts is superior to nonfractal controllers. We also verified the feasibility of in silico realization of the proposed optimal control algorithm by prototyping on FPGA platform.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659004","Cyber-physical systems;FPGA;Real time systems;artificial pancreas;fractal behavior;fractional calculus;non-stationary behavior;optimal and model predictive control","Blood;Fractals;Heuristic algorithms;Insulin;Mathematical model;Optimal control;Sugar","diseases;field programmable gate arrays;health care;mathematical analysis;patient monitoring","FPGA platform;artificial pancreas design;blood glucose characteristics;chronic diseases;coherent theory;cyber physical system approach;fractal calculus concepts;fractional calculus concepts;hardware architecture;insulin injection;mathematical model;multifractal optimal control problem;nonfractal controllers;nonlinear optimal controller;optimal control algorithm;patient monitoring;robust cyber physical systems;smart healthcare systems;time dependent fractal model","","1","","57","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The polyhedral compilation framework has shown great promise in this area with the development of HLS-specific polyhedral transformation techniques and tools. However, all these techniques rely on polyhedral code generation to translate a schedule for the program's operations into an actual C code that is input to the HLS tool. In this work we study the changes to the state-of-the-art polyhedral code generator CLooG which are required to tailor it for HLS purposes. In particular, we develop various techniques to significantly improve resource utilization on the FPGA. We also develop a complete technique geared towards effective code generation of rectangularly tiled code, leading to further improvements in resource utilization.

Researchers at Macronix have recently discovered that heating can cause worn-out NAND flash cells to become reusable and greatly prolong the lifetime of flash memory cells. However, the heating process consumes a substantial amount of power. This means that some fundamental changes are required if existing NAND flash management techniques are to be applied in self-healing NAND flash memory. In particular, all existing wear-leveling techniques are based on the principle of evenly distributing writes and erases. This causes NAND flash cells tend to wear out in a short time period. Moreover, healing these cells in a concentrated manner may cause power outages in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose for the first time a new wear-leveling scheme called DHeating (Dispersed Heating) to solve the concentrated heating problem in self-healing flash memory. In DHeating, rather than evenly distributing writes and erases over a time period, write and erase operations are concentrated on a small portion of flash memory cells, so that these cells can be worn-out and healed by heating first. In this way, we can disperse healing to avoid the problem of concentrated power usage caused by heating. Furthermore, with the very long lifetime that results from self-healing, we can sacrifice lifetime for reliability. Therefore, we propose an early heating strategy to solve the reliability problem caused by concentrated heating. The idea is to start the healing process earlier by heating NAND flash cells before their expected endurance. We evaluate our scheme based on a real embedded platform. The experimental results show that our scheme can effectively solve the concentrated heating problem.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658994","Dispersed heating;Flash memory;Power consumption;Self-healing;Wear leveling","Ash;Computer architecture;Heating;Logic gates;Microprocessors;Reliability;Silicon","NAND circuits;flash memories","DHeating;Macronix;NAND flash management techniques;concentrated heating;concentrated power usage;dispersed heating;embedded platform;erase operation;flash memory cells;heating process;heating repair;mobile devices;multilevel cell flash memory;power outages;self-healing NAND flash memory;time period;triple-level cell flash memory;wear-leveling techniques;worn-out NAND flash cells;write operation","","5","","32","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To support highly parallel execution, GPGPUs contain large register files (RFs) that are among the most highly stressed GPGPU components; however we observe heavy underutilization of RFs (on average only 46%) for typical general-purpose kernels. We present ARGO, an Aging-awaRe GPGPU RF allOcator that opportunistically exploits this RF underutilization by distributing the stress throughout RF. ARGO achieves proper leveling of RF banks through deliberated power-gating of stressful banks. We demonstrate our technique on the AMD Evergreen GPGPU architecture and show that ARGO improves the NBTI-induced threshold voltage degradation by up to 43% (on average 27%), that yields improving RFs static noise margin up to 46% (on average 30%).

As an alternative to strict priority (SP) scheduling, weighted round robin (WRR) is supported by most commercially available Ethernet switches. In WRR scheduling the link capacity is distributed fairly among traffic streams according to preset weights on a per round basis. As WRR does not provide latency guarantees, formal timing verification is necessary in order to deploy WRR in real-time applications. In this paper, we present a formal method to analyze WRR scheduling in Ethernet networks. Compared to existing methods which overestimate by assuming unnecessarily high interference, our method will take actual load bounds into account, thus achieving tighter analysis results. Finally, we perform an evaluation of our approach against existing methods and also against SP scheduling.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659012","Ethernet;formal performance analysis;network protocol;real-time systems;weighted-round robin","Equations;Interference;Mathematical model;Scheduling;Time factors;Timing;Upper bound","formal verification;local area networks;scheduling;telecommunication links;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication switching;telecommunication traffic","Ethernet network;Ethernet switch;WRR scheduling;distributed embedded applications;fair link capacity distribution;formal method;formal timing verification;formal worst-case timing analysis;interference;latency guarantee;load bound;real-time applications;strict priority scheduling alternative;traffic streams;weighted round robin scheduling","","1","","23","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work proposes an approach for optimal dimensioning and configuration of EES systems in EVs. It is challenging to find optimal design points in the parameter space, which expands exponentially with the number of battery types available and the number of cells that can be implemented for each type. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with the driving range, rated power output, installation space and cost as design targets. We report a novel boundary-conditioned adaptive scalarization technique to solve both convex and concave problems. It provides a Pareto surface of evenly distributed Pareto points, presents the group of Pareto points according to different specific requirements from automotive manufacturers and also takes the fact in EES system design into account that the importance of an objective could be nonlinear to its value.

Furthermore, several existing and emerging reliability loss mechanisms have caused increased transient, intermittent and permanent failure rates. While this variability has been typically addressed by process, device and circuit designers, there has been a recent push towards sensing and adapting to variability in the various layers of software. Current hardware platforms, however, typically lack variability sensing capabilities. Even if sensing capabilities were available, evaluating variability-aware software techniques across a significant number of hardware samples would prove exceedingly costly and time consuming. We introduce VarEMU, an extension to the QEMU virtual machine monitor that serves as a framework for the evaluation of variability-aware software techniques. VarEMU provides users with the means to emulate variations in power consumption and in fault characteristics and to sense and adapt to these variations in software. Through the use (and dynamic change) of parameters in a power model, users can create virtual machines that feature both static and dynamic variations in power consumption. Faults may be injected before or after, or completely replace the execution of any instruction. Power consumption and susceptibility to faults are also subject to dynamic change according to an aging model. A software stack for VarEMU features precise control over faults and provides virtual energy monitors to the operating system and processes. This allows users to precisely quantify and evaluate the effects of variations on individual applications. We show how VarEMU tracks energy consumption according to variation-aware power and aging models and give examples of how it may be used to quantify how faults in instruction execution affect applications.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659014","","Aging;Hardware;Integrated circuit modeling;Program processors;Registers;Switching circuits","operating systems (computers);power aware computing;virtual machines","QEMU virtual machine monitor;VarEMU emulation testbed;across-chip;aging model;chip-to-chip;integrated circuits;intermittent failure rate;nanometer technologies;operating system;permanent failure rate;power consumption;power-performance variation;reliability loss mechanisms;software variations;transient failure rate;variability sensing capabilities;variability-aware software techniques;variation-aware power model;virtual energy monitors","","5","","33","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although most sensor data is fixed-point, the normalization process-an absolute necessity for highly accurate similarity search of time-series data-converts the data to floating-point in order to avoid a loss in precision. The sensors that collect time-series data are typically connected to low-power microcontrollers or RISC processors sans floating point units. The computational requirements of real-time similarity search would overwhelm such processors.

Predictable and composable virtual platforms solve this problem by enabling verification in isolation, but designing SoC resources suitable to host such platforms is challenging. This paper focuses on a reconfigurable SDRAM controller for predictable and composable virtual platforms. The main contributions are: 1) A run-time reconfigurable SDRAM controller architecture, which allows trade-offs between guaranteed bandwidth, response time and power. 2) A methodology for offering composable service to memory clients, by means of composable memory patterns. 3) A reconfigurable Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) arbiter and an associated reconfiguration protocol. The TDM slot allocations can be changed at run time, while the predictable and composable performance guarantees offered to active memory clients are unaffected by the reconfiguration.

However, the computational requirements demanded by future perceptual computing applications will far exceed the capabilities of traditional vision algorithms that are executed on sequential CPUs and GPUs. Hardware accelerators are recognized as key to surpassing the limits of existing sequential architectures. In particular, brain inspired, or neuromorphic, vision accelerators have the potential to support computationally intensive perception algorithms on resource and power constrained devices.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659009","","Accuracy;Brain models;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Machine vision;Neuromorphics","computer vision;embedded systems;graphics processing units;image classification;image fusion;interactive systems;neural nets;ubiquitous computing","GPU;augmented reality;automotive domain;bottom-up image saliency;brain inspired sequential;computational requirements;computationally intensive perception algorithm;cortical based object classification;driver assistance;embedded neuromorphic vision systems;first person assistance;hardware accelerator;image data fusion;interactive perceptual computing application;medical domain;neuromorphic vision accelerators;personal analytics;pervasive computing;power constrained devices;resource constrained devices;retail domain;scene GIST extraction;sequential CPU;sequential architecture;vision algorithm;wearable first person computing device","","0","","","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Embedded supercomputing in FPGAs with the VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor","Severance, A.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","10","Embedded systems frequently use FPGAs to perform highly parallel data processing tasks. However, building such a system usually requires specialized hardware design skills with VHDL or Verilog. Instead, this paper presents the VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor, an FPGA-based soft processor capable of highly parallel execution. Programmed entirely in C, the MXP is capable of executing data-parallel software algorithms at hardware-like speeds. For example, the MXP running at 200MHz or higher can implement a multi-tap FIR filter and output 1 element per clock cycle. MXP's parameterized design lets the user specify the amount of parallelism required, ranging from 1 to 128 or more parallel ALUs. Key features of the MXP include a parallel-access scratchpad memory to hold vector data and high-throughput DMA and scatter/gather engines. To provide extreme performance, the processor is expandable with custom vector instructions and custom DMA filters. Finally, the MXP seamlessly ties into existing Altera and Xilinx development flows, simplifying system creation and deployment.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658993","","Clocks;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Finite impulse response filters;Hardware;Registers;Vectors","C language;FIR filters;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;formal specification;hardware description languages;instruction sets;logic design;microprocessor chips;parallel algorithms;parallel machines","Altera development flow;C programming;FPGA-based soft processor;MXP parameterized design;VHDL;VectorBlox MXP matrix processor;Verilog;Xilinx development flow;custom DMA filters;custom vector instructions;data-parallel software algorithm execution;embedded supercomputing;embedded systems;gather engine;hardware design;hardware-like speed;high-throughput DMA;highly parallel data processing task;highly parallel execution;multitap FIR filter;parallel ALU;parallel-access scratchpad memory;parallelism amount specification;scatter engine;system creation;system deployment;vector data","","4","","7","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"pvFPGA: Accessing an FPGA-based hardware accelerator in a paravirtualized environment","Wei Wang; Bolic, M.; Parri, J.","Comput. Archit. Res. Group, Univ. of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","9","In this paper we present pvFPGA, the first system design solution for virtualizing an FPGA-based hardware accelerator on the x86 platform. Our design adopts the Xen virtual machine monitor (VMM) to build a paravirtualized environment, and a Xilinx Virtex-6 as an FPGA accelerator. The accelerator communicates with the x86 server via PCI Express (PCIe). In comparison to the recent accelerator virtualization solutions which primarily intercept and redirect API calls to the hosted or privileged domain's user space, pvFPGA virtualizes an FPGA accelerator directly at the lower device driver level. This gives rise to higher efficiency and lower overhead. In pvFPGA, each unprivileged domain allocates a shared data pool for both user-kernel and inter-domain data transfer. In addition, we propose a new component, the coprovisor, which enables multiple domains to simultaneously access an FPGA accelerator. The experimental results have shown that 1) pvFPGA achieves close-to-zero overhead compared to accessing the FPGA accelerator without the VMM layer, 2) the FPGA accelerator is successfully shared by multiple domains, and 3) distributing different maximum data transfer bandwidths to different domains is achieved by regulating the size of the shared data pool at the split driver loading time.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658997","FPGA;coprovisor;hardware accelerator;paravirtualization;pvFPGA;shared data pool","Aerospace electronics;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Kernel;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","electronic data interchange;field programmable gate arrays;peripheral interfaces;virtual machines","API calls;FPGA accelerator;FPGA-based hardware accelerator;PCI express;PCIe;VMM;Xen virtual machine monitor;Xilinx Virtex-6;accelerator virtualization solutions;close-to-zero overhead;driver level;inter-domain data transfer;maximum data transfer bandwidths;multiple domains;paravirtualized environment;pvFPGA achieves;shared data pool;split driver loading time;system design solution;user space;user-kernel data transfer;x86 platform;x86 server","","0","","33","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such high-level simulations can achieve order of magnitude speedups, but approaches that can achieve highly accurate characterization of both power and performance metrics are lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel host-compiled simulation approach that provides close to cycle-accurate estimation of energy and timing metrics in a retargetable manner, using flexible, architecture description language (ADL) based reference models. Our automated flow considers typical front- and back-end optimizations by working at the compiler-generated intermediate representation (IR). Path-dependent execution effects are accurately captured through pairwise characterization and backannotation of basic code blocks with all possible predecessors. Results from applying our approach to PowerPC targets running various benchmark suites show that close to native average speeds of 2000 MIPS at more than 98% timing and energy accuracy can be achieved.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659023","Host-compiled simulation;Power and performance modeling","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Estimation;Optimization;Pipelines;Program processors;Timing","hardware description languages;power aware computing;program compilers","ADL based reference models;IR;PowerPC targets;architecture description language;back-end optimizations;compiler-generated intermediate representation;energy accuracy;energy metrics;front-end optimizations;high-level simulations;host compiled performance;host-compiled simulation approach;instruction-set simulations;pairwise characterization;path-dependent execution effects;performance metrics;power metrics;power modeling;source-level software execution approach;timing accuracy;timing metrics","","1","","32","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On the automatic generation of GPU-oriented software applications from RTL IPs","Bombieri, N.; Fummi, F.; Vinco, S.","Dipt. di Inf., Univ. di Verona, Verona, Italy","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","10","Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been explored as a new computing paradigm for accelerating computation intensive applications. In particular, the combination between GPUs and CPU has proved to be an effective solution for accelerating the software execution, by mixing the few CPU cores optimized for serial processing with many smaller GPU cores designed for massively parallel computations. In addition, sustained by the need of low power consumption besides high performance, a recent trend is combining GPUs and CPU onto a single die (e.g., AMD Fusion, Intel Sandy Bridge, NVIDIA Tegra). The good tradeoff between computing capability and power consumption makes the integrated GPUs a promising alternative for accelerating a wide range of software application for embedded systems. Nevertheless, algorithms must be redesigned to take advantage of these architectures and such a manual parallelization often results in being unsatisfactory. This paper presents a methodology to automatically generate software applications for GPUs, by reusing existing and preverified register-transfer level (RTL) intellectual-properties (IPs). The methodology aims at exploiting the intrinsic parallelism of RTL IPs (such as process concurrency and pipeline micro-architecture) for generating the parallel software implementation of the functionality. The experimental results show how the performance obtained by running the RTL functionality as software applications on GPUs outperform those provided by the RTL code mapped into a hardware accelerator.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6658999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658999","APU;GP-GPU processing;HW to SW migration;OpenCL;SW generation","Computer architecture;Graphics processing units;IP networks;Instruction sets;Parallel processing;Pipelines","embedded systems;graphics processing units;integrated circuit design;multiprocessing systems;software engineering","AMD Fusion;CPU cores;GPU cores;Intel Sandy Bridge;NVIDIA Tegra;RTL IP;RTL code;automatic GPU-oriented software application generation;computation intensive application acceleration;computing capability;computing paradigm;graphics processing units;hardware accelerator;parallel computations;pipeline microarchitecture;power consumption;process concurrency;register-transfer level intellectual-properties;serial processing;software execution","","0","","19","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A grid-connected hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) system can help residential users lower their electric bills by storing energy during low-price hours and releasing the stored energy during high-price hours. A HEES system consists of different types of electrical energy storage (EES) elements, utilizing the benefits of each type while hiding their weaknesses. This paper presents a residential energy management system to maximize the annual profits on residential electric bills, based on a HEES system comprised of a lead-acid battery bank as the main storage bank and a Li-ion battery bank as the energy buffer. We first derive the optimal daily energy management policy based on energy buffering to minimize the daily energy cost. Next, we find the near-optimal design specifications of the energy management system, aiming at maximizing the amortized annual profits under practical constraints. We show that this system achieves averagely 11.10% more profits compared to the none-buffering HEES system.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659019","Electric bill savings;energy management;hybrid electrical energy storage system","Batteries;Discharges (electric);Energy management;Lead;Pricing;Supercapacitors","battery storage plants;energy management systems;lead acid batteries","HEES system;energy buffering strategy;grid-connected hybrid electrical energy storage system;lead-acid battery bank;lithium-ion battery bank;main storage bank;residential energy management system;residential hybrid electrical energy storage system","","0","","19","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci. & Eng., UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2013 International Conference on","20131111","2013","","","1","10","We propose a tightly-coupled, multi-core cluster architecture with shared, variation-tolerant, and accuracy-reconfigurable floating-point units (FPUs). The resilient shared-FPUs dynamically characterize FP pipeline vulnerability (FPV) and expose it as metadata to a software scheduler for reducing the cost of error correction. To further reduce this cost, our programming and runtime environment also supports controlled approximate computation through a combination of design-time and runtime techniques. We provide OpenMP extensions (as custom directives) for FP computations to specify parts of a program that can be executed approximately. We use a profiling technique to identify tolerable error significance and error rate thresholds in error-tolerant image processing applications. This information guides an application-driven hardware FPU synthesis and optimization design flow to generate efficient FPUs. At runtime, the scheduler utilizes FPV metadata and promotes FPUs to accurate mode, or demotes them to approximate mode depending upon the code region requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (in terms of energy savings) on a 16-core tightly-coupled cluster with eight shared-FPUs for both error-tolerant and general-purpose error-intolerant applications.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659022","OpenMP;PVT variability;approximation;floating-point;multi-core;resilient;timing error","Approximation methods;Computer architecture;Pipelines;Registers;Runtime;Software;Timing","floating point arithmetic;image processing;meta data;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;pattern clustering","FP pipeline vulnerability;FPV metadata;OpenMP extensions;accuracy configurable computation;approximate computation;error correction;floating point units;hardware FPU synthesis;image processing applications;metadata;multicore cluster architecture;optimization design flow;shared FPU processor clusters;software scheduler;variability aware OpenMP environment","","1","","34","","","Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The inclusion of realistic plasticity equations, neural dynamics, and recurrent topologies has increased the descriptive power of SNNs but has also made the task of tuning these biologically realistic SNNs difficult.
