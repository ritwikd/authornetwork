"Hard-real-time scheduling of data-dependent tasks in embedded streaming applications","Bamakhrama, M.; Stefanov, T.","Leiden Inst. of Adv. Comput. Sci., Leiden Univ., Leiden, Netherlands","Embedded Software (EMSOFT), 2011 Proceedings of the International Conference on","20111031","2011","","","195","204","Most of the hard-real-time scheduling theory for multiprocessor systems assumes independent periodic or sporadic tasks. Such a simple task model is not directly applicable to modern embedded streaming applications. This is because a modern streaming application is typically modeled as a directed graph where nodes represent actors (i.e. tasks) and edges represent data-dependencies. The actors in such graphs have data-dependency constraints and do not necessarily conform to the periodic or sporadic task models. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the applicability of hard-real-time scheduling theory for periodic tasks to streaming applications modeled as acyclic Cyclo-Static Dataflow (CSDF) graphs. In such graphs, the actors are data-dependent, however, we analytically prove that they (i.e. the actors) can be scheduled as implicit-deadline periodic tasks. As a result, a variety of hard-real-time scheduling algorithms for periodic tasks can be applied to schedule such applications with a certain guaranteed throughput. We compare the throughput resulting from such scheduling approach to the maximum achievable throughput of an application for a set of 19 real streaming applications. We find that in more than 80% of the cases, the throughput resulting from our approach is equal to the maximum achievable throughput.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064526","Real-time multiprocessor scheduling;streaming applications","Equations;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules;Scheduling;Silicon;Vectors","data flow graphs;directed graphs;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","acyclic cyclo-static dataflow graphs;data-dependent task;directed graph;embedded streaming;hard-real-time scheduling;independent periodic task;multiprocessor system;sporadic task","","6","","28","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to previous works on multicore real-time task scheduling algorithms and synchronization protocols, this paper proposes a dedicated-core framework to separate the executions of application tasks and (system) services over cores such that blocking among tasks can be better explored and managed. The rationale behind the framework is that we can exploit the characteristics of many-core systems to resolve the challenges raised by the systems themselves. We define three core minimization problems with respect to the constraints on core configurations, and present corresponding task allocation algorithms with optimal, approximate, and heuristic solutions. The results of simulations conducted to evaluate the proposed framework provide further insights into task scheduling in many-core real-time systems.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064514","Many-core systems;real-time scheduling;task allocation;task synchronization","Approximation algorithms;Minimization;Protocols;Real time systems;Resource management;Silicon;Synchronization","multiprocessing systems;real-time systems;scheduling;task analysis","core minimization problems;dedicated-core framework;many-core systems;multicore real-time task scheduling algorithms;task synchronization","","2","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Demand bound server: Generalized resource reservation for hard real-time systems","Kumar, P.; Jian-Jia Chen; Thiele, L.","Comput. Eng. & Networks Lab., ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Embedded Software (EMSOFT), 2011 Proceedings of the International Conference on","20111031","2011","","","233","242","Servers have been proposed to implement resource reservations on shared resources. Such reservations isolate the temporal behavior of tasks sharing the shared resources, thereby providing performance guarantees to tasks independent of other tasks. In existing work, resource reservation has been synonymous to utilization (also called bandwidth) on the resource, i.e., we can reserve only a constant fraction of the resource utilization via a server. Such reservation schemes are not suited to serve interrupt-like tasks: tasks that occur seldom but require quick service or tasks with jitter. With this motivation, we present a generalized server algorithm, called Demand Bound Server (DBS), whose offered service is characterized by the demand bound function (dbf) of the task it serves. We show that schedulability of DBS tightly follows that of EDF, and if schedulable a DBS provides a performance guarantee as requested by the dbf of the task. We present an implementation of DBS when the dbf is a shifted-periodic curve and characterize its overhead. We also present efficient composition operations on DBS that widen the class of implemented servers to tightly serve tasks arising in most practical settings.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064531","Composition;Real-Time Systems;Servers;Timing Isolation","Calculus;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Real time systems;Satellite broadcasting;Servers;Timing","real-time systems;resource allocation","demand bound function;demand bound server;generalized resource reservation;generalized server algorithm;hard real-time system;interrupt-like task;resource utilization;schedulability;shifted-periodic curve;task sharing","","0","","18","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its safety properties were then assured according to the set of generic safety requirements also provided by the FDA. Once the safety of the reference model was established, we applied the TIMES tool to automatically generate platform-independent code as its preliminary implementation. The code was then equipped with auxiliary facilities to interface with pump hardware and deployed onto a real PCA pump. Experiments show that the code worked correctly and effectively with the real pump. To assure that the code does not introduce any violation of the safety requirements, we also developed a testbed to check the consistency between the reference model and the code through conformance testing.

To use these networks in real-time systems, their worst-case behavior must be proved analytically in order to ensure the required timing guarantees. Current analysis approaches, however, do not capture the multi-stage arbitration accurately. In this paper, we propose an analysis that maps the multi-stage arbitration to a schedulability analysis of multiprocessors with shared resources. This allows the exploitation of knowledge about the worst-case behavior of the individual traffic streams, which is required to provide non-symmetric guarantees. Using this scheduling analysis approach, a detailed analysis solution for a common multi-stage arbitration scheme (iSLIP) is presented. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach experimentally and compare it to previous work.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064532","Algorithms;Theory","Schedules;Switches","multiprocessing systems;multistage interconnection networks;network-on-chip;processor scheduling;real-time systems","crossbar inputs;crossbar outputs;iSLIP;individual traffic streams;knowledge exploitation;macro networks;multiprocessors;multistage arbitration schemes;nonsymmetric guarantees;on-chip networks;real-time communication analysis;real-time systems;schedulability analysis;scheduling analysis approach;shared resources;timing guarantees;two-stage arbitration;worst-case behavior","","0","","34","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The limiting average cost and the discounted cost are two standard criteria for such optimization problems. In theory of finite-state probabilistic systems, a number of interesting results are available relating the optimal values according to these two different performance objectives. These results, however, do not directly apply to timed systems due to the infinite state-space of clock valuations. In this paper, we present some conditions under which the existence of the limit of optimal discounted cost objective implies the the existence of limiting average cost to the same value. Using these results we answer an open question posed by Fahrenberg and Larsen, and give simpler proofs of some known decidability results on (probabilistic) timed automata. We also show the determinacy and decidability of average-time games on timed automata, and expected average-time games on probabilistic timed automata.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064523","Blackwell optimality;Quantitative Analysis;Tauberian Theorems;Timed Automata","Automata;Clocks;Cost accounting;Games;Markov processes;Optimization;Probabilistic logic","control engineering computing;control system synthesis;game theory;optimisation;probabilistic automata;real-time systems","controller synthesis;discounted costs;finite-state probabilistic systems;optimization;probabilistic extensions;quantitative analysis;reactive real-time systems;timed automata;timed games;timed systems","","0","","29","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our technique, first, transforms the input model into a model that has no priorities. Then, it transforms the deprioritized model into another model that resolves distributed conflicts by incorporating a solution to the committee coordination problem. Finally, it generates distributed code using asynchronous point-to-point send/receive primitives. All transformations preserve the properties of their input model by ensuring observational equivalence. The transformations are implemented and our experiments validate their effectiveness.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064512","Automated transformation;BIP;Committee coordination;Component-based modeling;Conflict resolution;Correctness-by-construction;Distributed systems","Bismuth;Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Context;Educational institutions;Semantics;Synchronization","distributed processing;embedded systems;object-oriented methods","component based model;deprioritized model;distributed embedded system;high-level synchronization primitives;model based approach;three phase method","","0","1","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents RT-Xen, the first real-time hypervisor scheduling framework for Xen, the most widely used open-source virtual machine monitor (VMM). RT-Xen bridges the gap between real-time scheduling theory and Xen, whose wide-spread adoption makes it an attractive platform for integrating a broad range of real-time and embedded systems. Moreover, RT-Xen provides an open-source platform for researchers and integrators to develop and evaluate real-time scheduling techniques, which to date have been studied predominantly via analysis and simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, efficiency, and efficacy of fixed-priority hierarchical real-time scheduling in RT-Xen. RT-Xen instantiates a suite of fixed-priority servers (Deferrable Server, Periodic Server, Polling Server, and Sporadic Server). While the server algorithms are not new, this empirical study represents the first comprehensive experimental comparison of these algorithms within the same virtualization platform. Our empirical evaluation shows that RT-Xen can provide effective real-time scheduling to guest Linux operating systems at a 1ms quantum, while incurring only moderate overhead for all the fixed-priority server algorithms. While more complex algorithms such as Sporadic Server do incur higher overhead, none of the overhead differences among different server algorithms are significant. Deferrable Server generally delivers better soft real-time performance than the other server algorithms, while Periodic Server incurs high deadline miss ratios in overloaded situations.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064510","deferrable server;hierarchical scheduling;periodic server;polling server;real-time virtualization;sporadic server","Open source software;Operating systems;Real time systems;Schedules;Scheduling;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","Linux;embedded systems;operating systems (computers);public domain software;scheduling;virtual machines;virtualisation","Linux operating systems;RT-Xen;complex real-time systems;deferrable server;embedded systems;open-source virtual machine monitor;periodic server;polling server;real-time hypervisor scheduling;real-time systems;sporadic server;system integration;virtualized environments","","7","","43","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such an integration is critical for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) when model parts are independently developed by different teams as it is the case in multi-tier industries, e.g. avionics and automotive. Analysis algorithms play a central role augmenting the designer's capacity to automatically verify properties of interest in systems at the scale and complexity required by these industries. Unfortunately, the verification results are valid only if the assumptions of the different analysis algorithms (analytic assumptions) are consistent with each other. This paper presents our work on the automatic verification of one important class of analytic assumptions in OAR models: resource allocation assumptions. These assumptions are modeled as Resource Allocation (RA) contracts. RA contract constructs include not only the typical assumes and guarantees but also runtime facts and implications. Finally, we automatically determine the correct sequence of execution of the analysis algorithms based on the contract input/output dependencies described in our models. Together these characteristics enable the automatic assumption verification that preserves the scalability of analytic models.

These policies and parameters are computed from high-level timing and control performance constraints. The proposed tutorial will cover different aspects of this design flow, with a focus on timing and schedulability problems. After reviewing the basic concepts of worst-case execution time analysis and schedulability analysis, we will discuss the differences between meeting timing constraints (as in classical real-time systems) and meeting control performance constraints (e.g., stability, steady and transient state performance). We will then describe various control performance related schedulability analysis techniques and how they may be tied to model-based software development.

We present an approach for specifying quantitative measures using reward and penalty functions, and illustrate its effectiveness using several examples. Each trajectory of the system, and each state of the system, is associated with a cost. Our goal is to synthesize a system that minimizes this cost from each initial state. Our algorithm works in two steps. For a single initial state, we reduce the synthesis problem to an unconstrained numerical optimization problem which can be solved by any off-the-shelf numerical optimization engines. In the next step, optimal switching condition is learnt as a generalization of the optimal switching states discovered for each initial state.

This “roadmap” paper prescribes an approach to modeling based on concurrent communicating components (called actors), where a diversity of orchestration strategies govern the execution and interaction of the components. The prescribed approach has been extensively explored in the Ptolemy Project, but as yet is not widely deployed in engineering practice. The approach achieves interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. The actor semantics is an abstract semantics that can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today. The actor abstract semantics and many concrete semantics are implemented in Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064506","Ptolemy;heterogeneity;models of computation","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Object oriented modeling;Semantics;Syntactics;Unified modeling language","large-scale systems;multiprocessing programs;public domain software","Ptolemy project;abstract semantics;actor semantics;complex systems;concurrent communicating components;heterogeneous actor modeling;modeling mechanisms;open-source software;orchestration strategies;roadmap","","0","","56","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is posed by complicated loops whose iterations exhibit non-uniform behavior. We adopt a brute-force strategy by simply unrolling them, and show how to make this scalable while preserving accuracy. Our algorithm performs symbolic simulation of the program. It maintains accuracy because it preserves, at critical points, path-sensitivity. In other words, the simulation detects infeasible paths. Scalability, on the other hand, is dealt with by using summarizations, compact representations of the analyses of loop iterations. They are obtained by a judicious use of abstraction which preserves critical information flowing from one iteration to another. These summarizations can be compounded in order for the simulation to have linear complexity: the symbolic execution can in fact be asymptotically shorter than a concrete execution. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation using a standard benchmark suite. We show that our algorithm is fast, and importantly, we often obtain not just accurate but exact results.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064540","Interpolation;Path Analysis;Summarization;WCET","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Context;Interpolation;Merging;Timing;Upper bound","iterative methods;program diagnostics;software reliability;symbol manipulation","WCET path analysis;abstraction;bounded programs;brute-force strategy;compact representations;complicated loops;comprehensive experimental evaluation;concrete execution;critical information;key challenge;linear complexity;loop iterations;nonuniform behavior;path-sensitivity;resource variable;standard benchmark suite;summarizations;symbolic execution;symbolic simulation;worst-case execution time path analysis","","0","","39","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many efficient modeling, programming and verification paradigms have been developed in this setting: mathematical modeling using differential equations, reactive and synchronous programming, data-flow based signal processing, model-checking, etc. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, systems are becoming much more complex. They mix hardware and software in subtle ways, involve a large number of sensors and actuators, become physically distributed, and may be remotely controlled by Web-based devices such as smartphones. Designing and verifying such systems raises many challenges that were independently known in particular areas but now need to be solved together. Here are some: understanding the relation between continuous and discrete time models, still quite unclear in the available mathematical modelers; understanding the ways in which synchronous and asynchronous communication could work in harmony; relaxing determinacy and timing constraints without losing too much predictability; being able to write full and faithful simulators of systems before building them, which is still a big problem in areas such as SoCs or transportation networks; developing methods to couple classical embedded systems with Web-based systems, which are of a very different nature. We will review some of the new problems posed in this area and some emerging solutions that could be applied to them, taking the notion of causality as the pivot of our reflections.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064505","Embedded systems;plenum talk","Actuators;Embedded systems;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Programming;Transportation","Web services;continuous time systems;discrete time systems;embedded systems;formal verification;large-scale systems","Web-based devices;asynchronous communication;causality;complex systems;continuous time models;discrete time models;embedded system;mathematical modeling;software program;synchronous communication;timing constraints;verification","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Fractal component-based framework, and its industrial instantiation MIND, provide for support for control operations in the lifecycle of components. Nevertheless, the use of complex and integrated architectures make the management of this reconfiguration operations difficult to handle by programmers. To address this issue, we propose to use synchronous languages, which are a complete approach to the design of reactive systems, based on behavior models in the form of transition systems. Furthermore, the design of closed-loop reactive managers of reconfigurations can benefit from formal tools like Discrete Controller Synthesis. In this paper we describe an approach to concretely integrate synchronous reconfiguration managers in Fractal component-based systems. We describe how to model the state space of the control problem, and how to specify the control objectives. We describe the implementation of the resulting manager with the Fractal/Cecilia programming environment, taking advantage of the Comete distributed middleware.

Not only does doing so make the software more comprehensible to those with domain understanding, it also becomes possible to check that the software conforms to correctness criteria expressed in the domain of interest. Here we present a unified framework that enables users to create ontologies representing arbitrary domains of interest and analyses over those domains. These analyses may then be run against software specifications, encapsulated as models, checking that they are sound with respect to the given ontology. Our approach is general, in that the framework is agnostic to the semantic meaning of the ontologies that it uses and does not privilege the example ontologies that we present here. Where practical use-cases and principled theory exist, we provide for the expression of certain patterns of infinite ontologies. In this paper we present two patterns of infinite ontologies: those containing values, and those containing ontologies recursively. We show how these two patterns map to use cases of unit systems and structured data types, and show how these are applicable to cyber-physical systems examples drawn from automotive and avionic domains. Despite the range of ontologies and analyses that we present here, we see user-built ontologies as a key feature of our approach.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064508","model engineering;ontologies;static analysis","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Lattices;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Semantics;Unified modeling language","embedded systems;formal verification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program diagnostics","automotive domain;avionic domain;cyber-physical system;embedded software;infinite ontology;model checking;model encapsulation;practical ontology framework;semantic meaning;software specification;static model analysis;structured data type","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More realistically, the goal is to guarantee a software development process that is conducted by knowledgeable engineers, who follow generally accepted procedures to control known risks, while meeting agreed upon standards of workmanship. We target three specific issues that must be addressed in such a certification procedure: the coding process, the code that is developed, and the skills of the coders. The coding process is driven by standards. The code is mechanically checked against the standards with the help of state-of-the-art static source code analyzers.

The goal of the approach is to allow the programmer to specify a part of her intent imperatively (that is, give a partial program) and a part of her intent declaratively, by specifying which conditions need to be achieved or maintained. The task of the synthesizer is to construct a program that satisfies the specification. As an example, consider a partial program where threads access shared data without using any synchronization mechanism, and a declarative specification that excludes data races and deadlocks. The task of the synthesizer is then to place locks into the program code in order for the program to meet the specification. In this paper, we argue that quantitative objectives are needed in partial-program synthesis in order to produce higher-quality programs, while enabling simpler specifications. Returning to the example, the synthesizer could construct a naive solution that uses one global lock for shared data. This can be prevented either by constraining the solution space further (which is error-prone and partly defeats the point of synthesis), or by optimizing a quantitative objective that models performance. Other quantitative notions useful in synthesis include fault tolerance, robustness, resource (memory, power) consumption, and information flow.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064521","quantitative models;quantitative synthesis;synthesis","Context;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Games;Robustness;Synchronization;Synthesizers","constraint theory;formal specification;information retrieval;synchronisation","Boolean synthesis;computational power;constraint solving technology;declarative specification;fault tolerance;information flow;partial program synthesis;program specification;programmer productivity;quantitative synthesis;resource consumption;shared data access;synchronization mechanism","","0","","42","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet the further development of flash memory strongly hinges on the tackling of its inherent implausible characteristics, including read and write speed asymmetry, inability of in-place update, and performance harmful erase operations. While Write Buffer Cache (WBC) has been proposed to enhance the performance of write operations, the development of a unified WBC management scheme that is effective for diverse types of access patterns is still a challenging task. In this paper, a novel WBC management scheme named Expectation-based LRU (ExLRU) is proposed to improve the performance of write operations while at the same time reducing the number of erase operations on flash memory. ExLRU accurately maintains access history information in WBC, based on which a new cost model is constructed to select the data with minimum write cost to be written to flash memory. An efficient ExLRU implementation with negligible hardware overhead is further developed. Simulation results show that ExLRU outperforms state-of-art WBC management schemes under various workloads.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064542","ExLRU;Flash Memory;Write Buffer Cache","Ash;Educational institutions;Flash memory;Hardware;Memory management;Organizations;Virtual private networks","cache storage;embedded systems;flash memories;write-once storage","ExLRU;NAND flash memory;embedded systems;expectation-based LRU;unified WBC management;write buffer cache management;write operations","","2","","20","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to tremendous research interest in techniques for scheduling signals, which are generated by real-time applications, on the FlexRay bus. Signals are first packed together into frames at the application-level and the frames are then transmitted over the bus. To ensure reliability of frames in the presence of faults, frames must be retransmitted over the bus but this comes at the cost of higher bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frame packing method for FlexRay bus. Our method computes the required number of retransmissions of frames that ensures the specified reliability goal. The proposed frame packing method also ensures that none of the signals violates its deadline and that the desired reliability goal for guaranteeing fault-tolerance is met at the minimum bandwidth cost.

Typically, the design of such systems proceeds in two steps. In the platform independent step, for each control loop in the system, the control designer calculates a control law and a sampling time that together ensure that the control loop has certain desired performance. Then, in the platform dependent step, these control tasks are scheduled on the platform, and a schedulability analysis determines if (and how) the control laws can be implemented and scheduled without missing the sampling deadlines. In this paper, we explore an alternative controller-scheduler co-design approach that aims to achieve optimal performance for all the individual control loops maintaining fairness. We first analyze the control systems to find out the rates at which control signals should be dropped to maintain schedulability and the optimal performance. We then use the rates to compute a schedule statically. We show a control theoretic approach to compute the effect of the rate of drops on the performance of the control systems and provide an SMT-based scheduling algorithm that takes as input control tasks, their periods, worst-case execution times, and their rate of drops, and outputs a static schedule that optimizes the performance of the control systems. We demonstrate our results through a case study on a family of inverted pendulums sharing the same processor for their control computations.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064538","Control Systems;Performance;Scheduling;Synthesis","Closed loop systems;Computational modeling;Schedules;Software;Switches;Upper bound","computability;control engineering computing;control system synthesis","SMT-based scheduling algorithm;control loops;control system;controller-scheduler codesign;cyber-physical system;inverted pendulum;performance-aware scheduler synthesis","","1","","29","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main novelty is a language with hierarchical automata that can be arbitrarily mixed with data-flow and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A type system statically ensures that discrete state changes are aligned with zero-crossing events and that the function passed to the numerical solver has no side-effects during integration. Well-typed programs are compiled by source-to-source translation into synchronous code which is then translated into sequential code using an existing synchronous language compiler.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064520","Block diagrams;Compilation;Hybrid systems;Real-time systems;Semantics;Synchronous languages;Type systems","Automata;Biological system modeling;Equations;Gravity;Mathematical model;Semantics;Synchronization","automata theory;differential equations;program compilers","ODE;Simulink;code generation;hierarchical automata;hybrid synchronous language;ordinary differential equations;simulation platforms;source-to-source translation;static translation;static typing;synchronous code;synchronous language;synchronous language compiler;synchronous languages","","0","","14","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For preemptive scheduling however, the isolated analysis of tasks becomes imprecise as interferences among tasks cannot be considered with sufficient precision. For such scenarios, the cache-related preemption delay (CRPD) denotes a key metric as it reflects the effects of preemptions on the execution behavior of a single task. Until recently, proposals for CRPD analyses were often limited to direct mapped caches or comparably imprecise for k-way set-associative caches. In this paper, we propose how the current best techniques for CRPD analysis, which have only been proposed separately and for different aspects of the analysis can be brought together to construct an efficient CRPD analysis with unique properties. Moreover, along the construction, we propose several different enhancements to the methods employed. We also exploit that in a complete approach, analysis steps are synergetic and can be combined into a single analysis pass solving all formerly separate steps at once. In addition, we argue that it is often sufficient to carry out the combined analysis on basic block bounds, which further lowers the overall complexity. The result is a proposal for a fast CRPD analysis of very high accuracy.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064541","Cache-related Preemption Delay;Multitasking;Static Analysis;Useful Cache Blocks","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Delay;Estimation;Proposals;Resilience;Upper bound","cache storage;scheduling;task analysis","CRPD analysis;WCET;cache-related preemption delay;nonpreemptive multitask scheduling;static estimation;synergetic approach;worst-case execution time","","0","","17","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Aciom: Application characteristics-aware disk and network I/O management on Android platform","Hyosu Kim; Minsub Lee; Wookhyun Han; Kilho Lee; Insik Shin","Dept. of Comput. Sci., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","Embedded Software (EMSOFT), 2011 Proceedings of the International Conference on","20111031","2011","","","49","58","The last several years have seen a rapid increase in smart phone use. Android offers an open-source software platform on smart phones, that includes a Linux-based kernel, Java applications, and middleware. The Android middleware provides system libraries and services to facilitate the development of performance-sensitive or device-specific functionalities, such as screen display, multimedia, and web browsing. Android keeps track of which applications make use of which system services for some pre-defined functionalities, and which application is running in the foreground attracting the user's attention. Such information is valuable in capturing application characteristics and can be useful for resource management tailored to application requirements. However, the Linux-based Android kernel does not utilize such information for I/O resource management. This paper is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to attempt to understand application characteristics through Android architecture and to incorporate those characteristics into disk and network I/O management. Our proposed approach, Aciom (Application Characteristics-aware I/O Management), requires no modification to applications and characterizes application I/O requests as time-sensitive, bursty, or plain, depending on which system services are involved and which application receives the user's focus. Aciom then provides differentiated I/O management services for different types of I/O requests, supporting minimum bandwidth reservations for time-sensitive requests and placing maximum bandwidth limits on bursty requests. We present the design of Aciom and a prototype implementation on Android. Our experimental results show that Aciom is quite effective in handling disk and network I/O requests in support of time-sensitive applications in the presence of bursty I/O requests.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064511","Android Platform;Application Characteristics Awareness;I/O Management","Androids;Bandwidth;Humanoid robots;Linux;Media;Middleware;Smart phones","Internet;Java;Linux;input-output programs;mobile computing;mobile handsets;multimedia computing;operating systems (computers)","Aciom;Android middleware;Android platform;Java applications;Linux based kernel;Web browsing;application characteristics aware disk;multimedia;network I/O management;open source software platform;resource management;screen display;smart phone","","0","","18","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define the notion of fault recovery for cyber-physical component-based models. We also present synthesis constraints that preserve the correctness and cyber-physical nature of a given fault-intolerant model under which recovery can be added. We show that the corresponding synthesis problem is NP-complete and consequently introduce symbolic heuristics to tackle the exponential complexity. Our experimental results validate effectiveness of our heuristics for relatively large models.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064519","Component-based modeling;Correctness-by-construction;Cyber-physical systems;Fault-tolerance;Recovery;Synthesis;Transformation","Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Protocols;Receivers;System recovery","computational complexity;fault tolerant computing;system recovery","NP-complete;automated addition;automated synthesis;cyber-physical component-based model;cyber-physical system;exponential complexity;fault recovery;fault-intolerant component-based model;fault-intolerant model","","0","","25","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France","Embedded Software (EMSOFT), 2011 Proceedings of the International Conference on","20111031","2011","","","351","352","Embedded systems must interact with their real-time environment in a timely and dependable fashion. Most embedded-systems architectures and design processes consider “non-functional” properties such as time, energy, and reliability as an afterthought, when functional correctness has (hopefully) been achieved. As a result, embedded systems are often fragile in their real-time behaviour, and take longer to design and test than planned. Several techniques have been proposed to make real-time embedded systems more robust, and to ease the process of designing embedded systems: 1. Precision-timed and time-triggered architectures, to make time a first-class citizen of system design. 2. Deterministic architectures for repeatable timing behaviour. 3. Composability, which guarantees that the (non)-functional behaviour of components is unchanged on integration in a larger system. The tutorial presents the state of the art and major approaches to time-predictability and composability, such as BIP, TTA, PRET, PTIDES, Giotto, and CompSOC.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064502","System on chip;composability;design;determinism;methodology;predictability;real-time","Biological system modeling;Educational institutions;Embedded systems;Real time systems;Semantics;Timing","embedded systems;object-oriented programming;software architecture","composability;composable architectures;dependable embedded systems;deterministic architectures;precision-timed architectures;time-predictable architectures;time-triggered architectures","","0","","4","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
