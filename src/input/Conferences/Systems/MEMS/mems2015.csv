A cracked metal wire on a stretchable substrate can get its conductivity again by the self-healing function. In this paper, first, we theoretically analyzed force acting on a nanoparticle and calculated a critical voltage which cause the electric field trapping. Next, we fabricated gold wires with artificially patterned cracks on a glass substrate and verified the self-healing function by experiments of a crack healing.

A novel approach of facilitating the diffusion and penetration of parylene coatings into PDMS using in-situ heated deposition is presented. The parylene depth profiling in PDMS and 180° peel tests demonstrate that parylene deposition at elevated temperatures shows enhanced pore sealing capability. A theoretical model is proposed, featuring an infinitely long cylindrical PDMS pore model, free molecular flow and time-varying pore geometry during the deposition.

SEM EDAX and Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were introduced to characterize the Parylene C caulked status in the PDMS matrix based on the specific Cl element component and the firstly-found temperature-sensitive autofluorescence of Parylene C. The preliminary results indicated that the present bonding-friendly pcPDMS can successfully suppress the diffusion of small molecules into the PDMS matrix.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050992","","Annealing;Coatings;Fluorescence;Microfluidics;Plasma temperature;Silicon;Surface treatment","X-ray chemical analysis;microfluidics;microscopy;permeability;plasma;polymers;scanning electron microscopy","LSCM;PDMS matrix;Parylene C;SEM EDAX;bonding-friendly pcPDMS;laser scanning confocal microscopy;low-permeability required microfluidics;oxygen plasma treatment","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the utility is general for a wide variety of microdevices and electronics, in this paper we demonstrate one application by developing a low-cost fabrication of a large-array electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chip that requires three metal layers.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050939","","Electrodes;Fabrication;Insulation;Metals;Nonhomogeneous media;Resistance","anodisation;interconnections;microfabrication;micromechanical devices","EWOD chip;electrical connections;large-array electrowetting-on-dielectric chip;metal layer anodization;microdevices;multilayer interconnection fabrication;photolithography;repeating deposition","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BDTT was characterized using tensile testing in a vacuum from room temperature to 600 °C. The fractured specimens showed that the slips were occurred at 500 °C and above, which indicated that the BDTT of micrometer-sized silicon decreased compared to millimeter-sized structures. By comparing the temperature ranges of the slip occurrences among the different sized specimens including other researchers' reports, we found that the length along slips-propagation direction, i.e. thickness, might dominate the BDTT.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050971","","Crystals;Displacement measurement;Stress measurement;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Testing","ductile-brittle transition;elemental semiconductors;silicon;slip;tensile testing","Si;brittle-ductile transition temperature;fractured specimen;micrometer-sized silicon;millimeter-sized structure;single crystal silicon;size 120 mum;size 2 mum;size 4 mum;size 9 mum;size effect;slip-propagation direction;temperature 293 K to 600 degC;tensile testing","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool to monitor the physiological changes of the zebrafish heart. However, due to its in-water habitat, a long term ECG monitoring solution, although very much needed, was not present. All published adult zebrafish ECG recorded to this date have been done acutely with anesthetized fish. This work presents, for the first time a wearable flexible parylene (PA) micro-electrode that monitors the Adult Zebrafish ECG long term.

Device was operated in rate integrating mode using a FPGA based control system. In contrast to the conventional amplitude control architecture, the central star electrode of the gyroscope, connected to a single drive channel was utilized for amplitude control of both modes. Due to the parametric pumping effect, energy added to each (x and y) mode is proportional to the existing amplitude of the respective mode. As a result, errors associated with finding the orientation of the standing wave and x-y drive gain drift are bypassed.

The electrical resistance of the MWCNT was 215 kΩ without strain, which was similar to the previously reported value, however the anomalous resistance change was observed under enormous strain. Although the resistance change ratio was almost constant during interlayer sliding of the MWCNT, it specifically showed a sharp raise at the end of the sliding in spite of the MWCNT not breaking mechanically. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provided a good understanding that the atomic reconfiguration due to the hard sticking at the edge of extracted outer layer of MWCNT might induce the sharp raise of resistance without its mechanically breaking.

This is in sharp contrast to the response of standard folded-beam suspensions. The static response of the standard folded-beam suspension is linear over a wide range of motions. But, surprisingly, the dynamic response of the standard folded-beam suspension is strongly nonlinear for small motion amplitudes that are larger than the width of the flexure beams.

The non-rotation part keeps a non-rotation state by using the air breaking boards. This non-rotation part controls its falling trajectory and the scattering region. By using large falling objects, aerodynamics of the falling object was characterized, e.g. falling speed, rotational speed, etc. Then the MEMS falling object was designed considering with this aerodynamics.

Low-cost and low-voltage ultrasound transducers would enable many new applications in healthcare, biometrics, and personal health-monitoring. Here, we demonstrated short-range (~mm) and high-resolution (<;100 μm) imaging based on piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) and a 1.8 V interface ASIC. The PMUTs use piezoelectric Aluminum Nitride (AlN), which has the advantages of low-temperature (<;400 °C) deposition and compatibility with CMOS fabrication but has a relatively low piezoelectric constant (e<sub>31</sub>=-0.5 C/m<sup>2</sup>), making detection of ultrasound signals from tiny (50 μm) PMUTs a challenging task. To solve this problem, we developed an ASIC with a low-noise analog front-end pre-amplifier that is impedance matched to the PMUT. Furthermore, a novel beam-forming and scanning method was demonstrated to achieve a sub-100μm focus size and 70 μm scanning step. Pressure map measurement from phased PMUT array and pulse echo imaging results were demonstrated using 1-D and 2-D phantoms.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050905","","Acoustic beams;Arrays;III-V semiconductor materials;Imaging;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic transducers","CMOS integrated circuits;III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;application specific integrated circuits;array signal processing;biomedical electronics;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;image resolution;image sensors;impedance matching;medical image processing;micromachining;microsensors;phantoms;piezoelectric transducers;preamplifiers;pressure measurement;sensor arrays;signal detection;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducers;wide band gap semiconductors","1D phantom;2D phantom;ASIC interface;AlN;CMOS fabrication;aluminum nitride PMUT array;beamforming method;biometrics application;healthcare application;image resolution;impedance matching;low-noise analog front-end pre-amplifier;personal health-monitoring application;piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer;pressure map measurement;pulse echo imaging;scanning method;size 50 mum;ultrasound imaging;ultrasound signal detection;ultrasound transducer;voltage 1.8 V","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Membrane-based approaches have been proposed to overcome the inherent limitations of the micro-cantilever system, but most results were either inconclusive or far from practical standards. Here we show clear-cut detection of molecular binding using a membrane transducer fabricated with conventional MEMS technology. This goal is achieved through the implementation of CMR that rejects physical effects such as pressure and temperature, leaving only specific chemical binding responsible for resulting signal.

In this approach, a single lithography step is used to pattern cantilevers that undergo lateral motion towards opposing stationary electrodes separated by a defined gap. Upon wet developing of the pattern, capillary forces induce cantilever deflection and collapse leading to permanent adhesion between the tip and an opposing support structure. The deflection consequently reduces the separation gap between the cantilever and the electrodes neighboring the point of stiction to dimensions smaller than originally patterned. Through nanoscale force control achieved by altering device design, we demonstrate the fabrication of nanogaps having controlled widths smaller than 15 nm.

For sensor evaluation, we conducted the rice cracker chewing test with our sensor attached to a real scale 3D jaw model, and propagation waves of around 500 Hz are observed.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051039","","Acoustic measurements;Acoustic sensors;Solid modeling;Teeth;Three-dimensional displays;Vibration measurement;Vibrations","biomechanics;bone;dentistry;vibration measurement","acoustic sensor fabrication;food texture;periodontal membrane;propagating teeth vibration measurement;real scale 3D jaw model;rice cracker chewing test","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By this means, uneven etching of the substrate is induced under the through holes, consequently, nanopillars are fabricated into patterns corresponding to the holes. By sputtering a thin layer of Ag on the nanopillar patterns, obvious Raman enhancement can be observed. Since the large areas around the patterns are protected from anisotropic etching and metal sputtering, they are flat enough to be bonded with PDMS caps thus to form microfluidic Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering devices, and the whole fabrication process for the devices is simplified.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050953","","Etching;Fabrication;Microfluidics;Nanoscale devices;Silicon;Substrates","nanofabrication;plasma materials processing;sputter etching","Raman enhancement;SERS devices;anisotropic etching;etching rate;fabrication process;lithography-free approach;metal sputtering;microfluidic surface-enhanced Raman scattering devices;nanopillar patterns;patternable nanopillars","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optimized active reflectors that resort to 100% metal coverage of the λ/4 extensions enable: (i) a considerable improvement of k<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>, (ii) spurious mode suppression, and robustness to processing (iii) misalignment and (iv) over/under-etching. 2X improvement in k<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup> and significant suppression of in-band spurious vibrations were attained with respect to the conventional design (without active reflectors) despite 0.5 μm misalignment and more than 0.5 μm overetch in the fabrication process.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051128","","Couplings;Electrodes;Etching;Fabrication;Fingers;Lithium niobate","lithium compounds;niobium compounds;resonators;semiconductor thin films;silicon compounds","SiO<sub>2</sub>;active reflectors;electrical signal;electroded quarter wavelength regions;electromechanical coupling;laterally vibrating resonators;resonant plate;size 0.5 mum","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been shown that as the thermal-piezoresistive amplification sets in, noise rms value increases with a slower rate than the boost in vibration amplitude and output signal level, therefore the SNR increases. In addition to higher sensitivity due to internal amplification in such devices, improvement in SNR reduces the minimum detectable signal in presence of limiting Brownian and thermal noises. Preliminary measurement results show that increasing the DC bias current, which leads to a 3X increase in vibration amplitude, improves the SNR by a factor of 4.5 (6.6 dB).","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051108","","Micromechanical devices;Signal to noise ratio;Thermal noise;Thermal sensors;Vibrations","amplification;microsensors;piezoresistance;thermal noise","Brownian noises;DC bias current;Lorentz force magnetometers;SNR improvement;amplitude modulated resonant MEMS sensors;noise RMS value;output signal level;signal to noise ratio;thermal noises;thermal-piezoresistive internal amplification effect;vibration amplitude;vibratory gyroscopes","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our previous work has shown that a microfluidic system equipped with a field-effect-transistor (FET)-based biosensor could detect CRP in 0.1X PBS and provided a limit of detection (LOD) of 26 pM CRP without gate bias. To improve the LOD, a new microfluidic device with a new methodology for measuring FET-based biosensors is presented in this study. Not only can the proposed system work in a solution with a physiological salt concentration but it also detects CRP with ultra-high sensitivity in an automatic fashion. This is the first time that a FET-based biosensor can effectively and automatically detect CRP in a physiological salt concentration without decreasing the sensitivity. The LOD of CRP using aptamer-immobilized AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) was experimentally found to be 1fM, demonstrating the superior performance of this new technique.

This study demonstrates the high selectivity of tactile pressure and temperature sensors against bending based on strain engineering. To achieve high selectivity, a cantilever type strain sensor in a flexible substrate is developed. In addition, the temperature sensor is also mechanically stable.

Graphene transferred on silicon nitride (Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) is below the analyte thin film, and the graphene resistance changes due to dangling bond interactions between the analyte film and graphene surface. At the same time, the resonance frequency of the analyte film/graphene/Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> composite membrane changes with variations in temperature, mechanical properties, mass and elasticity of the analyte film. This device provides a bi-modal characterization of the organic thin film, both in the electrical and mechanical domain, which allows one to identify and optimize the organic film formulation.

Cheerios effect is a common phenomenon in which small floating objects are either attracted or repelled by the sidewall via capillary effects. The wettability of the sidewall surface is known to be a key parameter for this phenomenon. By controlling the contact angle of the sidewalls via di-electrowetting and thus distorting the adjacent interfaces, Cheerios effect can be controlled to manipulate floating objects. In this control, the titling angle of the sidewall is found to be critical. Theoretical calculation and experimental results are compared for various titling angles and applied voltages. The theory qualitatively agrees with the experiments. Using this method, a linear transportation of millimeter-sized floating object in a channel is achieved. By sequentially applying a voltage to the arrayed di-electrowetting electrodes on the titled sidewalls and by carefully controlling the time interval between switching shifts, the floating object can be propelled continuously along the channel.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051000","","Dielectrics;Electrodes;Force;Liquids;Propulsion;Switches","contact angle;dielectric liquids;flow control;propellants;propulsion;transportation;wetting","active cheerios effect control;arrayed dielectrowetting electrodes;capillary effects;contact angle;dielectric fluid;floating object manipulation;linear transportation;millimeter-sized floating object;sidewall surface;switching shifts;titling angle;wettability","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On-chip enucleation using an untethered microrobot incorporated with an acoustically oscillating bubble","Il Song Park; Young Rang Lee; Sung Jin Hong; Kang Yong Lee; Sang Kug Chung","Myongji Univ., Yongin, South Korea","Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), 2015 28th IEEE International Conference on","20150302","2015","","","1059","1062","This paper presents a novel on-chip enucleation method using a magnetically driven microrobot incorporated with an acoustically excited bubble. The proposed microrobot mainly consists of a compressible bubble for the manipulation of a cell and twin neodymium magnets for the motion control of the microrobot in an aqueous medium. First, the two-dimensional (2D) motion control of the microrobot - horizontal, vertical, and rotational motions - is demonstrated by using an external magnetic controller attached beneath the bottom of a chip owing to the interaction forces induced by twin magnets installed inside both the microrobot and controller. Second, the enucleation of a cell is separately investigated using an acoustically oscillating bubble. When a bubble is acoustically excited at its natural frequency, it oscillates and simultaneously generates cavitational microstreaming and radiation forces around it. The flow pattern and strength of the microstreaming in different frequencies and voltages are studied using a microscopic PIV system. The flow strength is proportional to the voltage and strongly dependent on the frequency and maximum at its natural frequency. To investigate the effects of the microstreaming on the inside of a cell through a narrow slit, particle extraction test is conducted using a small PDMS cylinder chamber. It shows that most of the particles initially filled in the chamber are extracted by an acoustically excited bubble and the chamber becomes empty within 160 seconds. Finally, as proof of concept, the embryo extraction from a fish egg (1.7 mm diameter) dyed by methylene blue is successfully achieved using the proposed microrobot. This on-chip enucleation technique may improve the efficiency of enucleation processes with minimizing the contact damage between a cell and a micromanipulation tool.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051145","","Cloning;Embryo;Magnetic separation;Magnetoacoustic effects;Marine animals;Motion control;System-on-chip","microrobots;motion control","PDMS cylinder chamber;acoustically oscillating bubble;aqueous medium;cavitational microstreaming;compressible bubble;embryo extraction;external magnetic controller;fish egg;flow pattern;flow strength;magnetically driven microrobot;microscopic PIV system;motion control;neodymium magnets;onchip enucleation method;particle extraction;radiation forces;twin magnets;untethered microrobot","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This hybrid oligomer manipulation leverages the advantages of both electrokinetic and pressure-driven oligomer manipulation by reducing the amount of flow control elements (e.g. valves) while avoiding exposure of the target to electric field induced, potentially structure altering, environmental conditions (e.g. pH). Efficient manipulation of reagents and reaction products is achieved through bead-based affinity selection and amplification, which, combined with hybrid transfer, allows integration of all steps of the SELEX process on a single chip. The microfluidic device is thus capable of closed-loop, multi-round aptamer enrichment without manual intervention or use of off-chip instruments, as demonstrated by selection of DNA aptamers against the protein IgE with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 12 nM) in a rapid manner (4 rounds in 10 hours).","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050998","","Electric fields;Electrokinetics;Fluorescence;Libraries;Microfluidics;Proteins;Silicon","DNA;bioMEMS;biochemistry;electrokinetic effects;hydrodynamics;lab-on-a-chip;microfabrication;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;pH;proteins","DNA aptamer selection;SELEX process;bead-based biochemical;electrokinetic manipulation;flow control elements;hydrodynamic manipulation;microfluidic device;off-chip instruments;pH;pressure-driven fluid flow;pressure-driven oligomer manipulation;protein IgE;target-binding oligomer selection","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fabrication method might allow us to efficiently develop novel MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) devices such as wearable sensors and artificial muscle in large quantities at a low cost.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7050968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050968","","Electrodes;Fabrication;Films;Micromechanical devices;Substrates;Voltage measurement;Wet etching","etching;piezoelectric materials;piezoelectric thin films;piezoelectricity;polymers;stainless steel;thin films","MEMS devices;PDMS substrate;Pb(ZrTi)O<sub>3</sub>;artificial muscle;crystal structures;fabrication method;fabrication process;flexible piezoelectric substrate;inverse piezoelectric effect;microelectromechanical systems;piezoelectric properties;piezoelectric thin films;poly-dimethylsiloxane substrate;stainless-steel substrate;transfer technique;wearable sensors;wet etching process","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through investigations of the device resonances via optical excitation and detection by ultrasensitive laser interferometry, we first observe multimode resonances up to ~50MHz with the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate under different bending and stretching conditions. The device resonance frequencies (f<sub>res</sub>) first increase and then stabilize while quality (Q) factors are enhanced with PDMS trench widening of up to 161% in the region away from the MoS<sub>2</sub> flake and 61% at the MoS<sub>2</sub> flake edge, without breaking the device. This platform could facilitate investigations of the strain limits in devices, strain-induced bandgap tuning in two-dimensional (2D) crystals, and strain-engineered performance enhancement (e.g., f<sub>res</sub>, Q, and mobility) in 2D resonators. Furthermore, it is well suited for exploring new 2D flexible and wearable electronic components such as strain gauges and resonant transducers.","","","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2015.7051099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051099","","Clamps;Optical device fabrication;Optical imaging;Optical interferometry;Optical resonators;Resonant frequency;Substrates","Q-factor;energy gap;flexible electronics;light interferometry;micromechanical resonators;molybdenum compounds;polymers","2D crystals;2D flexible electronic components;2D resonators;MoS<sub>2</sub>;PDMS;bendability;bending conditions;device resonance frequency;device resonances;flake edge;flexible substrate;high-frequency nanomechanical resonators;microtrenches;optical detection;optical excitation;polydimethylsiloxane substrate;quality factors;resonant transducers;strain gauges;strain-engineered performance enhancement;strain-induced bandgap;stretchability;stretching conditions;two-dimensional crystals;two-dimensional nanomechanical resonators;ultrasensitive laser interferometry;wearable electronic components","","0","","","","","18-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Like other SAW resonator designs, the proposed resonator eliminates the release step common to most MEMS devices, leading to higher yield and simpler design and packaging. However, the use of a tapered PnC reflector in this work (Fig. 1) reduces the footprint of SAW resonators by > 100× relative to conventional metal grating reflectors while maintaining high Q. A 3.5× improvement in Q is experimentally demonstrated relative to resonators with uniform PnC reflectors of comparable dimensions.
