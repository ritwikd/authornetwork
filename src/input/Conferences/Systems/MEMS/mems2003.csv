The realized sensor array is mechanically flexible, which can be attached on nonplanar surfaces. To realize the flexible strain gauge, a new packaging scheme using polysilicon/oxide based surface-micromachining was developed. The proposed packaging scheme completes the strain sensors and the circuit board on a single process, which eliminates additional assembly and alignment problems. The measured gauge factor shows that it is more sensitive than metal strain gauge. Unlike a single-crystal silicon strain gauge, the proposed polysilicon gauge does not have any limitations in the direction of strain.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189816","","Capacitive sensors;Fabrication;Mechanical sensors;Micromachining;Packaging;Piezoresistance;Polyimides;Semiconductor films;Sensor arrays;Silicon","elemental semiconductors;micromachining;packaging;piezoelectric semiconductors;silicon;strain gauges","Si;Si-SiO<sub>2</sub>;flexible polysilicon strain gauge array;packaging;strain sensors;surface micromachining;surface-micromachined flexible polysilicon sensor array","","0","","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To produce these untethered micro-actuators in a batch-compatible manner while leveraging existing MEMS infrastructure, we have devised a novel post-processing sequence for the PolyMUMPS process. Through the use of this sequence, we show how to add, post hoc, a layer of dielectric between two previously-deposited polysilicon films.

"Business models for the successful commercialisation of silicon based MEMS","Neylon, S.","Colibrys S.A, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, 2003. MEMS-03 Kyoto. IEEE The Sixteenth Annual International Conference on","20030402","2003","","","455","","When considering how to construct or review business models for successful commercialisation of microsystems, it is wise to take into account several important factors that help assess the risk associated with one strategy versus another. Purely a statement of the novelty of the technology employed or the perception of a market need for a product or services are insufficient in themselves to undertake this risk assessment properly. Global macro economic factors, political or market specific forces, intellectual property conflicts, market resistance to new disruptive ideas are but a few of the factors that influence the success of a particular market strategy. These commercial factors can make the difference between what in Colibrys we define as 'creativity' and 'innovation'. The successful exploitation of an idea in the marketplace is the only true 'innovation' and differentiates winners from losers in today's marketplace. The commercial environment for nearly all technology companies today is extremely difficult. External factors such as the collapse of the internet bubble, the consequential rapid correction in the telecoms industry and resulting price pressures, the volatility of the worlds stock markets, and finally a collapse in confidence in corporate governance have all collectively taken their toll. For an emerging early-medium stage tech start up and even established (Small Medium size Enterprises) SMEs this is proving a real test of their financial strength. Commercial survival has replaced ambitious growth plans; financial breakeven has replaced IPOs and over-priced trade-sales. Any vision of the right Business model must take the current economic climate into consideration, not just an identification of a need for a product or service in the marketplace. This paper aims to explore these themes in more detail in particular with respect to Silicon MEMS manufacturing Business models.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189784","","Business;Communication industry;Environmental economics;Intellectual property;Internet;Micromechanical devices;Risk management;Silicon;Technological innovation;Telecommunications","micromechanical devices;risk management","Si-based MEMS;business models;creativity;global macro economic factors;innovation;intellectual property conflicts;market resistance;market specific forces;market strategy;microsystems commercialisation;political forces;risk assessment","","0","","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These steps protect nano tips during the whole process and minimize tip damage. To compensate residual stress, the multi-layered structure is used. It is composed of silicon nitride and poly silicon which have tensile and compressive stresses, respectively.

With this approach, DNA samples could be first duplicated using the micro PCR module, then injected and separated in the micro electrophoretic channels driven by electrokinetic forces, and finally detected optically by buried optical waveguides downstream the separation channel. In order to have a better separation efficiency for DNA samples, a novel surface treatment method by coating a thin layer of spin-on-glass (SOG) is developed. Experimental data show that DNA samples can be successfully duplicated using the micro PCR device with less sample and reagent volumes in a shorter period thanks to lower thermal inertia of the micro devices.

However, there are some problems such as sample loss when the injected plug encounters the junctions in the middle of the channel. This paper explains the phenomenon of the cyclic CE as an example of the channel network structure. In the new design, the quartz cyclic CE chip showed < 2 % degradation per junction. This means the high resolution CE analysis has 100,000 plate numbers after a three and one quarter cycle (20.4 cm) in just a 4 cm × 4 cm chip.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189778","","Chemistry;Degradation;Electric resistance;Electrokinetics;Electronic mail;Optical attenuators;Plugs;Telephony;Testing;Toy manufacturing industry","capillarity;channel flow;electrohydrodynamics;electrophoresis;microfluidics","4 cm;channel flow network;channel network structure;channel network structures;cyclic capillary electrophoresis;downsizing;high flow resistance compensation pattern;high reliability;injected plug;low electric field;low operation voltage","","0","","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The combined parametric/harmonic mode of operation is investigated as well and experimental data are provided.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189713","","Atomic force microscopy;Capacitors;Chemical sensors;Equations;Filters;Frequency;Mathematical model;Resonance;Sensor arrays;Voltage","electrostatic actuators;micromechanical devices","Mathieu equation;capacitively actuated microcantilevers;electrostatically actuated microcantilever;mathematical model;mechanical domain parametric resonance;parametric resonance phenomena","","3","1","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was found that the surface wettability can be dynamically switched from medium hydrophobic to super hydrophobic states by deflecting the membrane with a pneumatic method. The reported mechanism is the first demonstration of wettability switching by roughness modification.

Studies using hypochlorite (OCl) have shown it to be a strong oxidising agent in KOH, thus suitable for shifting electrochemical potentials, and for micropyramid suppression during etching. This new ES works by adding small amounts of sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, to KOH solutions. The dependency of the galvanic ES on KOH concentration and temperature is investigated.

The height of a switch and that of its cavity are independently controlled. The low process temperature allows eventual modular integration of switches on active substrates containing pre-fabricated electronic signal-processing circuits. The scheme also provides leads for electrical access to the sealed devices. The switches are based on a lateral mechanical resonator design responding to inertia change above a pre-determined threshold value.

The main advantage of the scanners is their high frequency of operation for both axes. Namely, the actuators allow static two-axis rotation of a micromirror without the need for gimbals, or specialized isolation technologies. Each device is actuated by four orthogonally-arranged vertical combdrive rotators etched in the device layer of an SOI wafer, which are coupled by mechanical linkages and mechanical rotation transformers. The transformers allow larger static rotations of the micromirror from the combdrive-stroke limited rotation of the actuators, with a magnification of 1.7× angle demonstrated. A device with a mirror diameter of 600 μm exhibits lowest resonant frequencies of 4.9 kHz and 6.52 kHz for x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The static optical deflection of the x-axis up to 9.6° and of the y-axis up to 7.2°, are achieved for <275 Vdc. Another type of device, designed for lower-voltage operation exhibits static optical deflection about the x-axis to 10.8° and about the y-axis to 11.7°, for <85 Vdc.

A rigorous and exact link is provided between the energy function corresponding to any given physical phenomena, and the resulting shape and size dependent force term in the (modified) Young's equation. It is shown that a dielectric solid and a perfectly conducting liquid is all that is needed to exactly recover the Young-Lippmann equation.

The Q-factor of the fabricated QCM increases exponentially from 2000 to 10000 as the thickness decreases due to the decrease of supporting loss.

When a growing metal in the through-holes was contacted to the gold, a resistance between the opposite two electrodes decreases suddenly. Thus the endpoint detection was realized by in situ monitoring of applied voltage at constant current mode.

Increased mass flow over the incompressible flow case is due to both compressibility and rarefaction. Deviations from the linear incompressible distributions get larger with the inlet to outlet pressure ratio. The dimensionless streamwise location of the maximum deviations is slightly less than 0.6, which is skewed slightly downstream of the middle of the channel.

IEEE The Sixteenth Annual International Conference on","20030402","2003","","","650","653","A frozen water process, which is clean, low temperature and biocompatible, is successfully demonstrated. The working principle is based on that frozen water can be processed as a solid thin film before it melts. In order to pattern the frozen water, hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions should be defined to allow water to be selectively attached to the hydrophilic area under the ambient environment. After water is frozen, a polymer layer can be spun on top of this solid layer to form the final structure. The frozen water can melt and evaporate gradually afterwards and function as the sacrificial layer. This frozen water process can also serve as a packaging procedure to encapsulate working liquids with an impermeable layer over the polymer. Two possible applications are envisioned and realized, including capillary-driven micropumps and micro optical lenses. Experimental results show that micropumps have flow rate from about 3nL/min at the beginning and reduce to about 0.2nL/min after 10 minutes with microchannel widths of 20 to 40 μm.

The conventional D-RIE process obtains the high aspect ratio trench etching with the protection layer, such as a polymeric layer. The etching anisotropy is limited in this process because this protection layer prevents not only lateral etching, but also vertical etching.

It is shown that a special isolation technique is suitable to separate the electrical potentials on the movable elements and therefore allows to excite the two oscillations independently.

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating.

The doped poly is used to create regions of conductivity within a nonconducting structure. Thus it is possible to create high-aspect-ratio, monolithic electromechanical microstructures which are transferable from a reusable mold. These microstructures are more resistant to thermal changes and misalignment errors compared to microstructures transferred in segments. A suspended electrostatic microactuator was successfully fabricated using this process. High-aspect-ratio structures, 100 μm and 75 μm tall, were fabricated with 7 μm wide capacitive gaps.

Each of these nozzles is connected to a distinct fluidic reservoir constituting the interface to the macro world. To allow an automated replenishing of the chip, the alignment of the reservoirs is amenable for liquid handling via standard pipetting robots.

It is a fast, cheap and accurate directional etch technique for brittle materials like glass, silicon and ceramics. By introducing electroplated copper as a new mask material, the feature size of this process was decreased. It was found that blasting with 9 μm particles (compared with 30 μm particles) result in a higher slope of the channel sidewall. The aspect ratio of powder blasted channels was increased by using the high resistance of the copper mask in combination with the use of 9 μm particles. Furthermore, our measurements show how the blast lag (small channels etch slower compared to wider channels) is decreased by using smaller particles","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838615","","Abrasives;Ceramics;Copper;Electrical resistance measurement;Etching;Glass;Machining;Micromachining;Powders;Silicon","micromachining","Cu;abrasive jet machining;brittle material;directional etching;electroplated copper mask;mechanical material;powder blast micromachining","","17","1","19","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A diaphragm (6 mm×6 mm×0.15 mm) was etched on the Si side for oscillation. The ultrasonic vibration originated from a bulk piezoelectric PZT ceramic (5 mm×4 mm×0.15 mm), which was excited by a 60 kHz square wave at 50 V (peak-to-peak). Liquids were mixed in a chamber (6 mm×6 mm×0.06 mm) with the Si oscillating diaphragm driven by the PZT. A solution of uranine and water were used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness.

To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves.

Over the years, micro-wire based devices that are manufactured by hand, have allowed researchers to record for several months, and in rare cases up to a year or more. Devices based on microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMs) offer more controlled designs with the added benefit of batch fabrication. Polymer-based MEMs interfaces offer exciting promise over traditional silicon arrays due to their mechanical flexibility and excellent biocompatibility. In this paper we microfabricated a neural interface using a new class of polymer known as benzocyclobutene (BCB), developed for microelectronics under the trade name Cyclotene™. This polymer has properties that we believe make it an attractive candidate for chronic implant applications.

Though the design of L-switching matrix improves system scalability but it suffers internal blocking problem. In this paper, a rearrangeably nonblocking algorithm will be presented. Moreover, two enhanced designs are proposed to improve the overall system performance of the L-switching matrix. They are the staircase switching mechanism and redundant switching system.

The SOI angular rate sensor (gyroscope), intended for wide dynamic range and harsh environment applications, utilizes advantages offered from the mass and feature sizes achieved by Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). This particular effort is focused on developing a symmetric device design along with multi-bit sigma-delta force-feedback control to increase dynamic range and reduce susceptibility to environmental parameters, including temperature, vibration, and sustained Z-axis acceleration loading. A prototype, single layer MEMS chip, consisting of a proof mass placed in a three-fold mode-decoupled symmetric suspension, has been fabricated and tested. The mode-decoupled suspension allows only one degree of in-plane motion for each comb drive, thereby attenuating errors due to oscillation axis misalignment. In addition, suspension symmetry maintains matched oscillation mode frequencies through processing and temperature variations, allowing maximized dynamic range in the discrete-time control loop. Attached to the suspension are comb-drives operating in their linear mode. Use of these actuators eliminates deflection-induced nonlinearity in the control loop. The rate sensing performance of these devices in an open-loop configuration has been characterized, and a unit is being flight-tested on a prototype hypervelocity missile. Current efforts will reduce random walk through preamp optimization, add an excitation control loop to improve bias stability, and implement the digital feedback loop to increase dynamic range.

International Conference on","20030818","2003","","","62","68","This paper investigates the application of two different meshing techniques used by the finite element method to analyze Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or structures. In this work, particular interest is focused on the application of these two techniques to comb-drive actuators, where a parametric study is carried out to optimize the design parameters of a lateral Electrostatic comb-drive actuator. In this case, the thickness, gab size, applied driving voltage and the number of Comb fingers are varied. The two meshing techniques applied are commonly known as, the Exposed Face Meshing method (EFM), and the Volume Refining Meshing (VRM) method. On one hand, the EFM algorithm permits the independent refinement of the electrostatic and the mechanical meshes while keeping full compatibility between the two meshed domains. On the other hand, the VRM method requires both, the electrostatic and the mechanical meshes, to be refined together at the same time; which result in a large problem size for complex structures with high aspect ratio. While the VRM method requires meshing of air gaps between the conductors, the EFM method uses the boundary element technique to map and calculate the electrostatic forces on the surfaces of the structure conductors, which eliminates the need to mesh the air gaps between the conductors, which is proved to be more efficient. In the current work, a calibration tool that can be used to enhance the efficiency of FE results produced by the VRM technique is developed. In this process, the results obtained from both meshing techniques of the para-metrically studied comb-drive are used to train a Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Network. This network is constructed using the FE results obtained from the (EFM) as the training target or output. The result obtained from the (VRM) technique is then fed as input to the network, which can then be calibrated using the EFM results.","","0-7695-1947-4","","10.1109/ICMENS.2003.1221966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221966","","Air gaps;Conductors;Design optimization;Electrostatic actuators;Finite element methods;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Neural networks;Parametric study;Voltage","electrostatic actuators;finite element analysis","Comb fingers;MEMS;design parameters;driving voltage;electrostatic comb-drive actuators;electrostatic forces;electrostatics;exposed face meshing method;finite element method;mechanical meshes;neural networks;volume refining meshing method","","0","","","","","20-23 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To measure X- and Y-axis magnetic fields, two fluxgate sensing elements were perpendicularly aligned. The fluxgate sensor was composed of rectangular-ring shaped magnetic core, solenoid excitation and pick-up coils. The 2 /spl mu/m thick Ni/sub 0.8/Fe/sub 0.2/ (permalloy) magnetic core layer was electroplated with photoresist frame using sputtered Ni/sub 0.8/Fe/sub 0.2/ seed layer. The fabricated fluxgate chip size was 4.5/spl times/2.7 mm/sup 2/. Excellent linear response over the range of -100 /spl mu/T to +100 /spl mu/T was obtained with 210 V/T sensitivity at excitation square wave of 2.8 V/sub p-p/ and 1.2 MHz. When two-axis fluxgate sensing element was rotated in terrestrial field, induced second harmonic voltages from X-and Y-axis were sine and cosine wave without distortion, respectively. It is very useful to commercialize the portable navigation system including north-up and map matching, military research, medical research, and space research.","","0-7803-7731-1","","10.1109/SENSOR.2003.1217091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217091","","Coils;Iron;Magnetic cores;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic sensors;Mechanical sensors;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Sensor systems;Solenoids","Permalloy;compasses;electric sensing devices;elemental semiconductors;iron alloys;magnetic cores;magnetic sensors;microsensors;nickel alloys;photoresists;silicon","1.2 MHz;2 micron;NiFe;NiFe magnetic core layer;Permalloy magnetic core layer;Si;Si based MEMS;Si based micro electro mechanical system;cosine wave;electronic compass;electroplating;induced second harmonic voltage;magnetic field;map matching;medical research;military research;pick up coils;rectangular ring shaped magnetic core;sine wave;solenoid excitation;space research;sputtering;two axis micro fluxgate sensing element","","0","","","","","8-12 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fifth International Conference on","20040524","2003","","","126","129","With the continuous reduction in IC feature size, the increased demand for higher speed and lower power consumption and with the simultaneous increase of I/O, wafer-level packaging is today an interesting solution for IC and micro electro mechanical systems(MEMS) packaging having as result the cost decrease and increased performance. With wafer-level packaging (WLP) the die and the package are fabricated and tested on the wafer prior to the dicing. Among the advantages of WLP are smaller IC package and a significant of-scale cost reduction due to high throughput of the parallel running packaging and electrical testing steps on wafer size. Thick resist-coating, lithography and wafer-to-wafer alignment for subsequent bonding are key enabling technologies for WLP. The roadmap for transistor scaling predicts further increase of circuit complexity, which comes along with higher pin count densities (pins per unit area) and therefore smaller feature sizes. This fact makes specialized and unique processing equipment development a must. This paper is summarizing the specific process requirements and will review the current technologies supporting WLP.","","0-7803-8168-8","","10.1109/EPTC.2003.1298707","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298707","","Circuit testing;Costs;Energy consumption;High speed integrated circuits;Integrated circuit packaging;Integrated circuit testing;Lithography;Throughput;Wafer bonding;Wafer scale integration","chip scale packaging;photolithography;spin coating","IC feature size;chip size packaging;circuit complexity;cost decrease;high throughput;lithography technologies;mask aligner;processing equipment development;thick resist-coating;wafer-level packaging;wafer-to-wafer alignment","","1","","","","","28-30 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
