In this abstract, we have first introduced a new interfacial microfluidic transport principle to automatically drive three-dimensional liquid flows on a micropatterned superhydrophobic textile (MST) platform in a controllable and continuous manner. Specifically, the MST system utilizes the surface tension-induced Laplace pressure to facilitate the liquid motion along the fabric, in addition to the capillary force existing in the fibrous structure. The surface tension-induced pressure as well as pumping speed can be highly controllable by the sizes of the stitching patterns of hydrophilic yarns and the confined liquid volume.

Two types of ssDNA were used as inputs, while the output was obtained by electrical signals across the nanopores, which recognizes whether ssDNA passed through the nanopores or not. NAND gate was successfully demonstrated by exploiting the mechanism. The proposed approach herein is significantly different from the conventional computation using DNA in the respect that electrical signals are directly obtained as the output, which drastically facilities the microfluidic system to connect to electrical systems for fast and accurate computing.

Previously, researchers have tuned the linear stiffness of microposts to investigate cell mechanobiological processes and direct cellular behavior; however, microposts suffer from an inherent, yet critical drawback - regulation of micropost stiffness is fundamentally limited to “biaxial” control. To overcome this issue, here we utilize three-dimensional (3D) direct-write laser lithography processes to fabricate arrays of microscale springs (μSprings). By adjusting the geometric characteristics of individual μSprings, the x-, y-, and z-axis stiffness of the cellular substrate can be customized at the microscale. COMSOL simulations were performed to characterize the theoretical “triaxial” stiffness associated with a variety of μSpring designs. Endothelial cells seeded on μSpring arrays were found to successfully deform the μSprings via cell-generated forces.

When stress is applied to the system, the surface of the system is often deformed in periodical wrinkle patterns due to the mismatch of the stiffness and the length. As reported in [3,4], the periodical patterns result in functional surfaces, such as smart adhesion, hydrophobic surfaces and diffractive gratings. In this paper, we present a tunable grating and a hydrophobic surface using the wrinkle phenomenon. The device is composed of a rigid layer and an elastomeric chamber. The chamber can be inflated pneumatically using oil, and the strain exerted on the device is controllable. By controlling the strain, we achieved a wrinkle pattern with a 10 μm wavelength whose amplitude is tunable from 1.6 μm to 2.8 μm. With this method, a tunable optical grating has been achieved. We have also created a tunable hydrophobic surface by controlling the surface roughness in two dimensions. The contact angle of a water droplet on the device ranged from 110 degrees to 130 degrees. The device can be fabricated with a transparent and flexible material and does not require electrical wires. This paper presents a range of possibilities for a functional wrinkle structure controlled using a MEMS technique.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474305","","Gratings;Optical surface waves;Rough surfaces;Strain;Surface morphology;Surface treatment;Surface waves","diffraction gratings;drops;elasticity;elastomers;hydrophobicity;micromechanical devices;surface roughness;thin films","MEMS technique;contact angle;diffractive gratings;elastomeric base;elastomeric chamber;flexible material;functional surfaces;functional wrinkle structure;multilayered systems;periodical wrinkle patterns;pneumatic inflation;rigid layer;rigid thin film;smart adhesion;stiffness-length mismatch;surface roughness;transparent material;tunable hydrophobic surface;tunable optical grating;water droplet;wavelength 10 mum;wrinkle phenomenon","","0","","7","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The microfluidic droplet-based device accepts an unlimited number of sample plugs containing genomic plant DNA from a multi-well plate. Each plug is separated by a fluorinated immiscible carrier fluid to prevent cross-contamination. Once plugs are loaded on to the device, mechanical chopping of these sample plugs is performed to digitize them into smaller daughter droplets. The device then performs subsequent synchronization-free, robust injection of multiple single nucleotide polymorphism interrogating probes in to the sample daughter droplets on-demand. This microfluidic platform combines the excellent control of valve-based microfluidics with the high-throughput capability of droplet microfluidics. Furthermore, generation of a one-dimensional array of combinatorial mixtures of DNA-probe droplets in which the sequence of drops is maintained throughout the device leads to automatic spatial indexing of these droplets, precluding the need for barcoding to identify droplet contents.

Second, the micro-object manipulation is separately tested with glass beads (100 μm diameter) and a steel ball (600 μm diameter) using an acoustically oscillating bubble.

Although these probes becomes a powerful tool in electrophysiology, the challenge still remains the tissue penetrations with small diameter probes for further low-invasive and safe tissue penetrations. However, it is difficult to penetrate small diameter probes with a high aspect ratio (e.g., a micro-scale diameter probe with the length of several hundred microns or more), due to the buckling of the probe during the tissue penetration (Fig.1). To realize the tissue penetration with small diameter needle with a high aspect ratio, quantitative discussions of the penetration force and the buckling/bending properties of the probe are further required. Here we verify the bending strength of silicon-microprobe with a high aspect ratio using in situ force-measurement-system (FMS) inside the SEM. In addition, these silicon probes are coated with a metal of iridium (Ir) with a high Young's modulus as the exoskeleton (shell), quantitatively confirming the increased stiffness of the probe.

The timing function of these valves is realized using a paper timing channel with an ionic resistor, which can detect the event of a solution flowing through the resistor and trigger an electromagnet (through a simple circuit) to open or close a paper cantilever valve. Based on this principle, we developed normally-open and normally-closed valves with a timing period up to 30.3±2.1 minutes (sufficient for ELISA on paper-based platforms). Using the normally-open valve, we performed an enzyme-based colorimetric reaction commonly used for signal amplification of ELISAs, which requires a timed delivery of enzyme substrate to a reaction zone.

Starting off with an intrinsic Q of ~1.3×10<sup>5</sup>, this device exhibits an amplification of effective Q (up to ~2.4×10<sup>5</sup>) by controlling the bias current. Measured results from several samples repeatedly show similar steady increments of Q within a specific bias current range (0-15mA), and agree with theoretical predictions. As the bias current increases from 0mA to 20mA, it is found that the resonant frequency drift versus ambient temperature can be augmented by as much 2.5 times in terms of the apparent TCf. At the same time, the Q-independent transconductance remains linear with bias current and DC bias voltage from experimental results. We show that the tuning of Q and apparent TCf are due to thermomechanical coupling and can be effectively achieved by varying the bias current.

As a proof of concept, the effective temperature coefficient of frequency (TC<sub>f</sub>) was measured under a manual control of bias power with one-point calibration to maintain constant structural resistance, ultimately demonstrating up to 46 times improvement of temperature stability as compared to uncompensated counterparts. This technology prevents the use of external temperature sensors or reference resonators with which errors occur due to indirect temperature measurement of the active MEMS resonator.

The self-sticking of the curled device has been demonstrated on wet samples, due to the surface tension between the parylene-N and the sample.

When the starch-gel was immersed into a solution containing iodine, swelling became slow, gradual and heavily dependent on the temperature and on the thickness of the starch. Microfabricated silicon springs dipcoated with approximately 7.5 μm thick starch retracted 100 μm during dehydration and deployed within a few minutes in water at 37°C.

To overcome this issue, here we introduce single-layer microfluidic “domino” diodes, which utilize free-standing rotational microstructures - constructed in situ via optofluidic lithography - in order to passively regulate the fluidic resistance based on the flow polarity, thereby enabling flow rectification under ultra-low Re conditions.

However, the holes were made by photolithography and the minimum size was limited to be 3 μm in diameter. Large holes allow multiple bacteria to be immobilized in a hole, which resulted in errors in quantification. The number of bacteria immobilized in a nanoimprinted hole was found to have smaller deviation than in photolithographically formed holes.

The produced ED-ISM has a thinner thickness (<; 10 μm) and higher surface-area than typical ISM for such that the sensing performance can be greatly enhanced due to the faster ion diffusion through the membrane.

The limit of detection is measured to be as low as 0.1 ppm (S/N=3). Result also indicates that the response reached 95% in 8s for detecting 1 ppm of urea using the developed microchip device, which is much faster than that obtained using typical commercial ion selective electrode. The developed microchip with ED-ISM provides a low-cost yet high performance way for on-site reaction and detection of biosamples.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474460","","Biochemistry;Biomembranes;Electrodes;Force;Microfluidics;Polymers;Solvents","ammonia;bioMEMS;biomembranes;chemical reactions;enzymes;microsensors;polymers;surface tension","ED-ISM;ammonia ion;bioreactive enzyme;biosample detection;diamond shape microstructures;electrochemical detection;high perforlance urea detection;ion selection;ion selective electrode;microchip device;microfluidic chip;neighboring air sheath flows;on-site bioreaction;on-site reaction;passing urea molecules;polymer liquid;surface tension force;thin enzyme-doped ion selective membrane","","1","","13","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reports an approach to build a micro MET seismometer using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) techniques. We have reduced the MET cell size, resulting in internal dimensions close to 1 micrometer (μm).

However, the lack of effective vaccines and drugs still leads to a high transmission rate of HIV. It was estimated that 2.7 million new infections occurred in 2011. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to control the HIV transmission. Thus, many efforts have been made to explore a rapid and accurate method for HIV detection. The capabilities of antibody-based determination and nucleic-acid-based molecular diagnosis to detect HIV infections have been verified. Yet these methods have some intrinsic drawbacks. For example, antibody-based assays involve a lengthy process and may have an open-window issue while polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays require delicate equipment and well-trained personnel. In this work, we present an integrated microfluidic system using a rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay which could automatically detect DNA fragment of HIV-1. With this approach, the HIV-1 could be detected automatically to reduce the risk of contamination with no human intervention. Additionally, the specially designed hook primer coated on the magnetic beads and a padlock probe both contribute to RNA extraction with higher specificity such that this developed system is capable of detecting HIV-1 from blood cells directly with improved accuracy. Successful demonstration for detection of HIV-1 DNA fragment has been achieved by using the proposed microfluidic platform.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474390","","DNA;Human immunodeficiency virus;Magnetic liquids;Magnetosphere;Microfluidics;Probes;Purification","DNA;RNA;bioMEMS;biochemistry;biomedical equipment;blood;cellular biophysics;enzymes;microfluidics;microorganisms;molecular biophysics;patient diagnosis","DNA fragment;RNA extraction;antibody-based assays;antibody-based determination;blood cells;blood samples;diagnosis;drugs;human immunodeficiency virus detection;human immunodeficiency virus infections;integrated microfluidic system;magnetic beads;nucleic-acid-based molecular diagnosis;padlock probe;polymerase chain reaction-based assays;primer coating;rolling circle amplification assay;vaccines","","0","","15","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The huge reduction of surface energy and the formation of high-density nanostructures (i.e. nanotips) on well-designed microstructures (i.e. inverted pyramids and V-shape grooves) were realized simultaneously due to the enhancement of passivation step of DRIE process. Therefore, the high-temperature thermal cross-linking process, even higher than 180°C, can be directly utilized on the pattern replication of PDMS without surfactant coating to strengthen the precision. After studying of heating temperature and time, the MNDS PDMS membrane with the static contact angle (CA) of ~151° was realized at the optimized temperature of 85°C after 1-hour heating. The plasma treatment of the same improved DRIE process was utilized to enhance the hydrophobicity.

For our use, the array was glued on a 100μm-thick glass substrate for ease of handling. Each cage is to trap an individual neuron to force a close proximity of the neuron to an embedded electrode inside the cage for stimulation and recording. In addition, each neurocage has six tunnels emanating from the cage to allow axons and dendrites to grow outward and form synapses with other trapped neurons. The Electrode inside each neurocage can then be used to stimulate and/or record electrical activity from the trapped cell at any given time. Why thin and flexible? From our previous work, it is learned that manually loading neuron one-by-one into the cage is time-consuming. We then propose to use laser tweezer to do the cell loading from the backside of the array. To facilitate laser tweezer neuron loading, the neurocage array must be transparent and thin.

Electroporation can be induced by illuminating an optical image on a photoconductive layer when the top and the bottom substrates were applied with an electric field. One of the most important factors that affected efficiency of optically-induced gene transfection was the optical patterns illuminating on the chip. Therefore, a series of various optical patterns, including multiple circles, squares, and triangles, were tested in order to enhance the efficiency of gene transfection. Consequently, the pattern of multiple triangular spots was experimentally confirmed to have the highest efficiency of gene transfection. In addition, three fluorescence carried plasmids could be successfully transfected into different types of cells by using the developed optically-induced electroporation platform at the same time.

The core is achieved by sequential electrodeposition of permalloy and copper, followed by selective removal of the copper, thereby releasing the core laminations. Electroplated silver is selected as winding material for its low resistivity and to withstand the copper etching required during core release.

When a bubble is acoustically excited by a piezoactuator around its natural frequency, it oscillates and simultaneously generates microstreaming and radiation forces, which can be used to manipulate (pull and push) neighboring objects.

To investigate the surface wettability, the thicknesses of Cytop and Teflon layers coated with different weight percent of Cytop and Teflon solutions are precisely measured by AFM. And the contact angles of D.I. water droplets sitting on the Cytop and Teflon layers with different thicknesses are measured by a microscope from the side. The results show that for Cytop films the contact angles of D.I. water droplets on the Cytop films thicker than 3 nm maintain around 110° on the other hand, the contact angles with the Cytop film thinner than 3 nm suddenly drop and decrease as the film becomes thinner. Teflon films show the similar trend as Cytop films, except the critical thickness (7 nm). The contact angle hysteresis on the different thicknesses of Cytop and Teflon films is separately investigated by the tilting base method. The results show that for the thin hydrophobic films, the contact angle hysteresis is over 10° however, it decreases as the film thickness increases. When the film is thicker than 12 nm, the values of the contact angle hysteresis are approximately halved and saturated. Based on the test results, the optimum hydrophobic film thickness (12 nm) is suggested. Finally, the thickness effect of the hydrophobic film on the operating voltage in EWOD actuation is tested. As expected the operating voltage in thin hydrophobic films is lower than in thick films. For the Cytop film, the saturation voltage in 12 nm is 20 V lower than 500 nm and 40 V lower than 1500 nm, respectively. Similarly, for the Teflon film, the saturation voltage in 12 nm is 20 V lower than 600 nm and 40 V lower than 1600 nm, respectively.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474444","","Decision support systems","atomic force microscopy;contact angle;dielectric properties;hydrophobicity;microfluidics;wetting","AFM;Cytop film thickness;Cytop films;DI water droplets;EWOD actuation testing;EWOD systems;Teflon layers;atomic force microscopy;contact angle hysteresis;electrowetting-on-dielectric system;hydrophobic film thickness;hydrophobic layer;microfluidics;operating voltage reduction;size 12 nm;size 7 nm;surface wettability;thickness effect;tilting base method;voltage 20 V;voltage 40 V","","0","","14","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a microchamber, single Vorticella increases the speed of mixing by two orders of magnitude higher than mixing by diffusion. 9 to 15 cells of Vorticella mix the particles in a dynamic fluid. Investigation of individual mixing effect by Vorticella reveal the vertical transport to a flow is effective.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474178","","Fluid dynamics;Indexes;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Microorganisms;Valves","bioMEMS;biodiffusion;biological techniques;cellular transport;fluid dynamics;microchannel flow;mixing","Vorticella cilia;Vorticella mix;cellular biophysics;diffusion;dynamic fluids;fluid mixing;microchamber;microchannel;microfluidics;particle transporter;pumping;stationary fluid","","0","","7","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A bilayer lipid membrane is immediately formed at the interface of the split droplets. These processes are conducted on a micro device which we termed as split-and-contact device. The aqueous droplet with a lipid monolayer is split mechanically by either spinning or sliding motions of the device. We experimentally verified the effectiveness of the proposed split-and-contact device by using α-hemolysin and its blockers (single-stranded DNA and hepta-6-sulfato β-cyclodextrin).

A 1.9° device was capable of detecting accelerations from 0.01 to 10 g rms.

Miniature liquid lenses sealed by deformable membranes are arranged on a flexible substrate. During the operation, the flexible substrate where the liquid lenses reside is driven by hydraulic pressure and bulges into different curvatures, which results in the maximal angular difference of the optical axes of individual lenses in the array from 0° to 45°. The focal length of each lens can be simultaneously tuned from 64.3mm to 2.1mm. At the directional view of 45° and focal length of 2.1mm, the overall FOV exceeds 150°.

When a pressure was applied on the pyramid array, the deformation of each pyramid induced the larger contact area between each pyramid and the resistor. Since the pyramid array was coated by a gold layer, which had much lower resistivity than that of the silicon beam, the resistance of each contact area drastically decreased. Therefore the resistance between two electrodes of the silicon beam decreased. Our demonstrated sensor showed the non-linear response to the applied pressure, which was caused by the increase in elasticity of each pyramid as its deformation became larger. This non-linear property can be used as an advantage to enlarge the sensing range of the sensor. The sensitivity of our sensor for the pressure from 0 to 1 kPa was 0.61 kPa<sup>-1</sup>.

Adhesion forces between the samples and the conducting AFM tip was also measured. The best cyclic I-V performers were Ir, Pt, W & Ti. The trend in changing R<sub>c</sub> seen in Ir, Pt and W are similar and can be attributed to factors such as their high Young's modulus, high melting temperatures and high density and low adhesion forces. Ti yeilded the best I-V behavior where contact resistance improved slightly as a function of cycling. A relationship between adhesion forces and defect generation in the contact region is observed and the results of both sets of experiments are detailed here.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474274","","Adhesives;Contact resistance;Force;Force measurement;Nickel;Surface morphology","Young's modulus;adhesion;aluminium;atomic force microscopy;chromium;coatings;contact resistance;copper;iridium;melting;metal-insulator boundaries;metallic thin films;nanoelectromechanical devices;nickel;platinum;titanium;tungsten","Al-SiN-Si;Cr-SiN-Si;Cu-SiN-Si;I-V measurements;Ir-SiN-Si;NEMS switches;Ni-SiN-Si;Pt-SiN-Si;Ti-SiN-Si;W-SiN-Si;Young modulus;adhesion forces;conducting tip;contact resistance evolution;contact-mode atomic force microscopy;current versus voltage measurement system;hot-contact switching;melting temperature;silicon nitride coated silicon;thin-film metals","","1","","16","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, the resonator on diamond withstands energy densities more than 2 times larger than the resonator on silicon before devices fracture and fail mechanically.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474278","","Bifurcation;Density measurement;Diamonds;Energy measurement;Energy storage;Resonant frequency;Silicon","bifurcation;crystal resonators;diamond;elemental semiconductors;failure (mechanical);fracture;silicon","C;Si;bifurcation point;critical energy density;fracture limit;lateral-extensional TPoS resonators;mechanical failure;resonator design;resonator fractures;silicon substrate;thin-film piezoelectric-on-substrate resonators;ultrananocrystalline diamond","","1","","9","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with thin film electrets prepared by spin-coating method, bulk PTFE electrets are of higher trapped charge density by 1.2~2 times, and improved charge storage stability by 1.3 times in charge retain rate over 10 days. Further, the micromolding method guarantees high throughput and cost-effectiveness. The proposed harvester is non-resonant and is of gap-closing structure, which is suitable for low frequency vibration. Maximally, the packaged device generates 2.5μW @10Hz, 1.6g vibration, which is 9 times improvement in power compared with our previous thin film PTFE work. Such results display the potential of using micro-molded bulk PTFE electrets for integrated electrostatic energy harvester in low frequency applications.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474377","","Electrets;Electric potential;Electrodes;Electrostatics;Metals;Silicon;Vibrations","electrets;electrostatic generators;energy harvesting;spin coating","frequency 10 Hz;gap-closing structure;integrated electrostatic energy harvester;low frequency vibration;micromolded bulk PTFE electrets;micromolded bulk electrets;micromolding bulk electrets;packaged device;packaged electrostatic energy harvester;packaged energy harvester;polytetrafluoroethylene;power 2.5 muW;spin-coating method;thin film PTFE;trapped charge density","","2","","14","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The discharge characteristic and particle charging capability of the proposed corona discharger were experimentally examined. At the result, the corona current and induced current by charged particles were 3 times higher than those of the tip-to-pate micro corona discharger.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-5654-1","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2013.6474282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474282","","Atmospheric measurements;Corona;Current measurement;Dielectrics;Discharges (electric);Electrodes;Silicon","corona;dielectric measurement;discharges (electric);micromachining","airborne particle number concentration measurement;charged particles;corona current;discharge electrode;micromachined tip-to-plate corona discharger;slit dielectric barrier","","0","","5","","","20-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
