Magnetic beads conjugated with specific nucleotide probes were first incubated with influenza virus. Then thermolysis and hybridization processes were performed to extract target RNA by utilizing a magnetic field. Then, extracted viral RNA can be specifically amplified by using a one-step RT-PCR process. Finally, amplified RT-PCR products were detected using the optical detection module. The entire process can be completed within less than 2 hour. Moreover, the detection limit of the microsystem was experimentally found to be 10<sup>4</sup>~10<sup>5</sup> dilution of 128 HAU of influenza virus for influenza A virus H1 subtype. Consequently, the proposed integrated microfluidic system can provide a powerful platform for rapid diagnosis of influenza infection.

A testing chip is designed to test the fabricated device sealed with photoresist which can be released by acetone afterward. This work demonstrated a cracking pressure of 0.17 psi by the popping and 0.32 psi by the combined thermal annealing (at 140°C) and popping. The final device is designed as 6 mm long, which is useful for heath care or any biomedical applications.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734619","","Annealing;Coatings;Fabrication;Resists;Silicon;Surface treatment;Testing","annealing;cracks;internal stresses;microfluidics;tensile strength;valves","all-parylene;cracking pressure;in-channel pop-up checkvalve;mechanical residual tensile stress;microfluidic regulating system;para-xylylene;photoresist;popping mechanism;surface-micromachined;temperature 140 C;thermal annealing","","0","","5","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unit cell of this design utilizes an X-shaped air inclusion, instead of the conventional circular ones, in a solid host material. This novel design extends the operating frequency of the AlN PBG to the GHz range by using a structure minimum feature size of 750 nm, instead of 300 nm required by the conventional circular design, which therefore lessens the requirements during the photolithography process. The experimental results confirm the existence of a frequency band gap from 860 MHz to 1.2 GHz with maximum attenuation of 40 dB in the Γ-X direction. The amplitude of rejection and the frequency stop band is verified by COMSOL<sup>®</sup> finite element method (FEM) simulation, proving, for the first time, that COMSOL<sup>®</sup> can be employed for the full characterization of these structures. Low-loss acoustic delay lines in AlN were employed to form the reference response to which the PBG is compared.

After the micro structures are fabricated by silicon bulk micromachining, the CNTs are synthesized from each of the facing surfaces of proof-mass and fixed electrode. When the motion of the proof-mass is generated from incoming acceleration, effective contact area between two sets of CNT bundles changes, resulting in a change of electrical contact resistance. This CNTs-based accelerometer achieves both high sensitivity and wide bandwidth.

The device integrates well-defined microfluidic reaction chambers and utilizes a three-dimensional structure in which a layer of resistive microheaters and temperature sensors are precisely aligned to these chambers to provide uniform heating, in-situ temperature sensing, and convenient self-calibration. Notably, this device exploits the novel use of an antimony-bismuth (Sb-Bi) thermopile with high thermoelectric performance to significantly enhance device sensitivity and thus allow for DSC detection with minimized sample consumption. We demonstrate the utility of this MEMS DSC device by characterizing the unfolding of proteins in a minimized volume (1 μL), and at low protein concentrations approaching practically useful levels (1 mg/mL). Quantitative thermodynamic properties including the total enthalpy change (ΔH) and melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) during this conformational transition are determined and found to agree with published data.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734551","","Heating;Microfluidics;Micromechanical devices;Polyimides;Proteins;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","antimony;bioMEMS;biothermics;bismuth;differential scanning calorimetry;enthalpy;melting point;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;phase transformations;proteins;temperature sensors;thermodynamics;thermoelectric devices;thermoelectricity;thermopiles","DSC;MEMS differential scanning calorimeter;Sb-Bi;antimony-bismuth thermopile;biomolecules;conformational transition;device sensitivity;enthalpy;in-situ temperature sensing;melting temperature;microfluidic reaction chambers;microfluidic regulation;on-chip self-calibration;protein unfolding;resistive microheaters;self-calibration;temperature sensors;thermodynamic characterization;thermoelectric performance;thermoelectric sensing;three-dimensional structure","","1","","10","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tapered inlet and outlet ports and fluidic interconnects facilitate pumped transfer of thermally desorbed vapors to downstream components for analysis. The MISI samples the air at a known rate by diffusion without active pumping, it preconcentrates VOCs, and then thermally desorbs the captured VOCs for injection to the separation column.

To realize such promising applications, there is strong demand for a LOS detection system that does not restrict users' activities and inflicts no mental stress. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable LOS detection system, featuring minimum disturbance to users, both physically and mentally, via the use of dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. These latter are transparent and generate voltage according to the incident light intensity. Arraying the devices on wearable eyeglasses, this system detects the difference in the reflection light from the pupil and the white of the eye and hence determines the position of the pupil. It is wearable as eyeglasses, meaning it does not disturb users' activities or eyesight. More importantly, it involves minimal physical and psychological stress. We fabricated the photovoltaic device and demonstrated their feasibility to determine the location of the pupil. We improved the accuracy of pupil location detection by arraying the micro-patterned devises using MEMS technology.

The entire fabrication process can be completed within one hour in common laboratories with simple tools (e.g., a paper cutter and a painting knife), without requiring cleanroom facilities. The paper substrate allows easy integration of electrical signal processing circuits onto the paper-based MEMS devices. We demonstrated that the paper-based sensor can measure forces with moderate performance (i.e., detection limit: 120 μN, measurement range: ±16 mN, and sensitivity: 0.84 mV/mN), and applied the sensor to characterizing mechanical properties of soft materials. We also developed a paper-based weighting balance with a measurement range of 15 g and a resolution of 25 mg.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734379","","Force sensors;Materials;Micromechanical devices;Resistance;Resistors;Structural beams","force sensors;microfabrication;microsensors;piezoresistive devices","conductive material;electrical signal processing circuit;fabrication process;mass 15 g;mass 25 mg;mechanical property;paper-based piezoresistive MEMS force sensor;soft material;structural material","","8","","17","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This stretching results in a nonlinear stiffness which provides a passive feedback and consequently a Duffing mode resonance. The doubly-anchored beam structure stores the majority of the strain energy in non-linear stretching and behaves like a frequency locked loop device.

Without using sophisticate and high-temperature thin-film process, the entire fabrication process can be performed at low-temperature and completed in a shorter period of time when compared with the fabrication process of amorphous silicon. In this study, we fabricated the ODEP device on a flexible substrate, which may further extend its practical applications. In addition, the rapid separation of micro-particles can be realized with the incorporation of gravity effect utilizing the arch-shaped flexible substrate. More importantly, the fabrication process was compatible with the roll-to-roll process such that large-area, flexible polymer substrates can be adopted for further applications such as concentration, transportation and separation of micro-particles/cells.

The MEMS structure is designed to work at resonant frequency for maximum sensitivity to electric fields. Prototyped by the SOI fabrication process, the device gives high quality factor (Q) of approximately 31034 at a vacuum degree of ~1mTorr with lower actuation voltages (i.e., 250mV DC and 20mVp-p). The sensing area of this sensor is only 5mm×5mm and it requires only less than 1μW to drive its shutter. Tested in ambient air conditions, a minimum detectable DC and AC electric field with current sensor designs better than 50V/m is also achieved. The use of a miniature sensor also helps to measure local electric field around insulators accurately since the field distortion caused by the sensor is minimum.

The screw we use is made by microstereolithography with magnetically modified photo curable polymer previously reported in MEMS '09. We placed the micro screw inside a glass capillary and rotated it by an external magnetic field at high frequencies. Because of the screw's shape, it causes the surrounding fluid to be propelled forward. By decreasing the diameter of the tubing connected to the screw-housing capillary, we succeeded in producing extremely low flow rates. Since we use an electronic magnetic field to rotate the micro screw, we can realize a very high response when stopping the flow. We also pay attention to the position of screw which is influenced by three factors, the propulsive force, magnetic trap force, and static flow force, and we created a new method to monitor flow rate with knowing rotational frequency and position of screw.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734638","","Fasteners;Fluids;Force;Magnetic fields;Micropumps;Monitoring","fasteners;flow control;flow sensors;magnetic traps;microchannel flow;micropumps;propulsion","electronic magnetic field;fluid flow;glass capillary;magnetic trap force;microchannel device;microstereolithography;mobile micro screw pump;on-site flow control;on-site flow sensing;photo curable polymer;propulsive force;rotational frequency;screw position;static flow force","","1","","9","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is higher than exhibited by any sputtered thin-film AlN resonator measured to date at any frequency and more than 2.2× larger than previously achieved by similar devices using conventional (i.e., contacting) electrodes. By attaining such high Q, this work erases a common belief that material losses in sputtered AlN dominate the Q's of resonators constructed in this material and confirms that sputtered AlN is a high-Q material. It further suggests that energy loss associated with contacting electrodes is primarily responsible for the low Q's of previous AlN resonators.

The model possesses both structural and mechanical characteristics of the natural counterparts. To mimic the semi-permeable wall of natural vessels, microfluidic channels with porous walls are fabricated by spinning polymeric nanofibers on the collecting substrate with three-dimensional microelectrodes. The mechanical properties of the porous substrate are evaluated using conventional tensile testing. The permeability of the fibrous membrane is characterized by perfusion experiments. The results collectively show the utility of the membrane in transvascular study. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are cultured on the fibrous membrane and form an endothelial monolayer. The resulting structure is elastic and distensible, similar as natural blood vessels. The curved endothelium surface also helps to mimic the complex mechanical loading states of natural vascular endothelium under pulsatile flow. This work is expected to add a new dimension to the widely used microfluidic systems by allowing both in-vessel transport and trans-vessel transport. The immediate impacts of the porous microfluidic systems can be found in in vitro study of circulatory and respiratory systems.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734584","","Biomembranes;In vitro;Microelectrodes;Microfluidics;Substrates;Surface topography","bioMEMS;biological fluid dynamics;biomimetics;blood vessels;microfluidics;nanofibres;permeability;polymer fibres;porous materials;pulsatile flow","HUVEC;circulatory system;endothelial monolayer;fibrous membrane;human umbilical vein endothelial cells;in-vessel transport;microfluidic channels;natural vessels;perfusion experiments;permeability;porous microfluidic system;pulsatile flow;respiratory system;semipermeable wall;spinning polymeric nanofibers;tensile testing;trans-vessel transport","","0","","5","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Improving the resolution performance of MEMS structures mounts to being able to either increase the minimum detectable signal through an increased sensitivity, or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper reports on parametric amplification and damping employed in a MEMS gyroscope. Experiments confirm that parametric modulation through electro-mechanical coupling leads to both an increase spectral selectivity and a reduction of the equivalent input noise angular rate (from 0.046deg/(sec√Hz) to 0.0026deg/(sec√Hz) for a parametric gain of 5). In a more general analysis of a MEMS resonant structure, electro-mechanical parametric amplification decreases the mechano-thermal noise associated with the mode motion-the equivalent input noise acceleration was diminished from 0.033m · s<sup>-2</sup> to 0.022m · s<sup>-2</sup> for a parametric gain of 5. Both signal amplification and an attenuation of undesired signal components can be achieved by tuning the phase difference between the driving force and the parametric coupling. Therefore, the technique can be applied to reduce the quadrature error signal, which strongly constrains the maximum gain of the sensing circuit.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734500","","Couplings;Damping;Force;Gyroscopes;Micromechanical devices;Noise;Sensors","damping;gyroscopes;micromechanical devices;readout electronics;thermal noise","MEMS gyroscopes;MEMS resonant structure;MEMS structures;electrical readout circuit;electro-mechanical coupling;electro-mechanical parametric amplification;inertial sensors;mechano-thermal noise;parametric amplification/damping;parametric modulation;signal-to-noise ratio","","1","","7","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Residue analysis after polymer etching was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

This PR cover can prevent HF-based solution from diffusing through and arriving at the surface of the noble metal, thus cut off the electrical current of the electrochemical corrosion and thus protect the polysilicon layer intact. The polysilicon layer can be protected longer than 80 min in 49% HF solutions by 3 μm thick AZ6130 photoresist.

The mass which vibrates between two counter electrodes by white noise voltage is “pulled-in” to either of the counter electrodes by applying pulse voltage to the mass. The direction of the pull-in is determined stochastically, and the probability that the mass is pulled in to a particular side depends on mechanical strain applied to the sensor. Therefore, strain can be measured just by counting the number of pull-in to a particular side, which is easy even in low S/N environments. We demonstrated this sensing principle using an SOI-based sensor, which had a reliable pull-in release mechanism using a non-linear spring structure. We also demonstrated that the pull-in probability could be tuned by bias voltage applied to the counter electrodes, as predicted by simulation.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","978-1-4244-9634-1","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734506","","Electrodes;Force;Radiation detectors;Springs;Strain;White noise","electrodes;microsensors;silicon-on-insulator;strain sensors;white noise","MEMS;SOI based sensor;counter electrode;pull in probability;pull-in release mechanism;sensing principle;stochastic strain sensor;white noise applied bistable state;white noise voltage","","1","","2","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fundamentally, due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry, such as ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. The principle of harvesting irregular mechanical energy by the nanogenerator relies on the piezopotenital driven transient flow of electrons in external load, which can be resulted from body motion, muscle stretching, breathing, tiny mechanical vibration/disturbance, sonic wave etc. As of today, a gentle straining can output 1-3 V at an instant output power of ~2 μW from an integrated nanogenerator of a very thin sheet of 1 cm2 in size. This technology has the potential applications for power MEMS/NEMS that requires a power in the μW to mW range. Furthermore, we have replaced the externally applied gate voltage to a CMOS field effect transistor by the strain induced piezopotential as a “gate” voltage to tune/control the charge transport from source to drain. The devices fabricated by this principle are called piezotronics, with applications in strain/force/pressure triggered/controlled electronic devices, sensors and logic units.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","978-1-4244-9634-1","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734375","","Electric potential;Logic gates;Piezoelectric polarization;Strain;Substrates;Wire;Zinc oxide","II-VI semiconductors;III-V semiconductors;biomedical equipment;electric generators;energy harvesting;gallium compounds;indium compounds;micromechanical devices;nanoelectromechanical devices;nanomedicine;nanotechnology;piezoelectric devices;pneumodynamics;zinc compounds","CMOS field effect transistor;GaN;InN;ZnO;breathing;charge transport;electron transient flow;gate voltage;logic unit;mechanical energy harvesting;muscle stretching;nanogenerators;noncentral symmetry;piezoelectric potential;self-powering nanosystems;sensors;smart MEMS;smart NEMS;sonic wave;strain induced piezopotential;strain-force-pressure triggered-controlled electronic devices;strained induced piezotronics;voltage 1 V to 3 V","","2","","16","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fabrication of a compliant mechanism using conventional sacrificial surface micromachining results in a non-planar structure with a step between the structure and its anchor. During mechanism actuation or assembly, stress accumulation at the structure step can easily pass the yield strength of the material and lead to structure failure. Our process overcomes this problem by eliminating the step between the structure and its anchor, and achieves planarization without using Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP). The process is based on low temperature and post-CMOS compatible nickel silicide technology. We use a layer of amorphous silicon (a-Si) as the sacrificial layer. High etch selectivity between silicon and nickel silicide in the XeF<sub>2</sub> gas enables us to use the silicide to anchor the structures to the substrate. The sacrificial layer is locally converted to nickel silicide to form the anchors. The formed silicide has the same thickness as the sacrificial layer; therefore, the structure is virtually flat. The maximum measured step between the anchor and the sacrificial layer is about 10 nm on a 300 nm thick sacrificial layer.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734425","Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP);Nickel silicide;Surface Micromachining;Xenon Difluoride;planarization","Annealing;Films;Nickel;Silicides;Silicon;Substrates;Surface treatment","CMOS integrated circuits;chemical mechanical polishing;etching;micromachining;nickel compounds","CMP;NiSi;amorphous silicon;chemical mechanical polishing;compliant mechanism;freestanding microstructure;high etch selectivity;nonplanar structure;post-CMOS compatible technology;robust micromachining process;sacrificial layer;size 300 nm","","0","","10","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low temperature deposition of the conductive polymer using spin-coating reduces an unexpected electrode warpage due to a thermal stress caused by thermal processes such as metal evaporation.

With this approach, an aptamer specific to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is a biomarker for liver cancer, has been successfully screened.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734392","","DNA;Magnetic separation;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Micropumps;Proteins;Time frequency analysis","DNA;bioMEMS;cancer;liver;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;proteins","amplification;automatic SELEX chip;competitive assay chip;exponential enrichment;integrated microfluidic system;large combinatorial nucleic acid library;liver cancer biomarker;molecule binding;partition;polymerase chain reaction;rapid alpha-fetoprotein aptamers screening;ribonucleic acid;short single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid;systematic ligand evolution","","0","","12","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we demonstrate a direct physical exfoliation and transfer processes of graphene grown via ethanol-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Our exfoliation process exploits a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp for conformal contact with graphene. Moreover, it rapidly exfoliates a few-layer graphene (FLG) film with high quality from entire graphene layers on Ni within 5 min. Indeed, the process time is significantly faster than few hours for a standard process. Even after exfoliation, our graphene shows high quality which is verified by the high intensity ratio of G band to D band (IG / ID > 20) in Raman spectra. IG / ID of our graphene is approximately five times higher than that of standard graphene (IG / ID <; 4) that implies low defects in our graphene. The technology for exfoliating a FLG film can be used for highly desired layer-by-layer manipulation of graphene because it is still difficult to synthesize appropriate layers of graphene on an arbitrary substrate. Through the graphene transfer process, we integrate the exfoliated graphene film to a silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) surface with low damage for various N/MEMS applications. Also, by employing ethanol vapor (i.e., cheap and stable) as a source of carbon for graphene synthesis, we improve a conventional synthesis process of graphene using methane gas (i.e., expensive and explosive).","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734371","","Carbon;Chemicals;Ethanol;Films;Nickel;Optical surface waves;Surface treatment","Raman spectra;chemical vapour deposition;graphene;thin films","C;MEMS application;NEMS application;Raman spectra;SiO<sub>2</sub>;direct physical exfoliation;ethanol chemical vapor deposition;ethanol vapor;few-layer graphene film;graphene transfer process;layer-by-layer manipulation;methane gas;polydimethylsiloxane stamp;silicon dioxide surface","","1","","18","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the actuators are fabricated with elastomeric materials, they are very robust and can undergo large strains in both tension and bending and still operate once released.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734429","","Actuators;Fabrication;Force;Heating;Polymers;Silicon","bending;microactuators;microfabrication;polymers","conductive polymer;elastomeric material;nonconductive polymer feature;robust thermal actuator;size 100 mum;soft all-polymer MEMS actuator","","1","","18","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without using photolithography or etching, the proposed process creates microneedles with: 1) higher aspect ratios than that of the original mold, 2) controllable needle diameter for optimized mechanical strength, and 3) arrowhead-shaped tips for potentially increased capacity and effective payload delivery. The needles presented are formed with biocompatible, water-soluble polymers, but the fabrication process inherently allows many kinds of polymers to be exploited. Various high aspect ratio 3D structures were fabricated and characterized, and the fabrication result was compared with theoretical prediction. Water-soluble microneedle arrays have been fabricated and successfully penetrated into porcine skin, fully releasing the drug-surrogate into the dermis layer within a minute.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734416","","Fabrication;Lithography;Needles;Plastics;Shape;Skin;Three dimensional displays","bioMEMS;biomedical materials;drawing (mechanical);microfabrication;moulding;needles;polymers;solubility","3D structures;biocompatible water-soluble polymers;dermis layer;direct drawing;drug surrogate;high aspect ratio structures;maskless fabrication;mechanical strength;micromolding;microneedle arrays;porcine skin","","0","","9","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gate electrode extended along the length of the beam enabling higher holding force at the moment of the contact, which facilitated the suppression of the dynamic bouncing. The dimple structure was also introduced along the beam's length preventing the beam from collapsing to the gate electrode. Through these considerations on the switch design, the switching time of the conventional switch was reduced to 60 % of the conventional one's. Also, the proposed switch was observed to endure over 1.5 times of its pull-in voltage.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734654","","Contacts;Electrodes;Logic gates;Micromechanical devices;Structural beams;Switches;Switching circuits","cantilevers;electrodes;integrated circuits;microswitches","IC application;cantilever switch;dimple structure;dynamic bouncing suppression;extended gate electrode","","0","","9","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to the 1100°C furnace anneal required for the migration process, the pulsed-laser process localizes the heat to the top few microns of the substrate, with the bulk kept at near to room temperature. In addition, there is no need for special surface treatment, or for a controlled environment. Furthermore, the treatment can be applied to selected regions of the substrate.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734415","","Argon;Laser beams;Quantum dot lasers;Seals;Silicon;Substrates","electronics packaging;elemental semiconductors;encapsulation;laser materials processing;membranes;microfabrication;seals (stoppers);silicon;surface treatment","Si;pulsed-laser process;pulsed-laser processing;silicon membranes release holes sealing;silicon surface migration sealing process;surface treatment;temperature 293 K to 298 K;thermal-budget silicon sealed-cavity microencapsulation process","","0","","6","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An oscillator using a 23 MHz in-plane shear mode resonator with a quality factor of 4,000 exhibits a phase noise of -130 dBc/Hz at 1 KHz offset-frequency, corresponding to an improvement of about 20 dB with respect to linear operation.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-9632-7","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734541","","Electrodes;Micromechanical devices;Performance evaluation;Phase noise;Resonant frequency;Silicon","III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;amplifiers;elemental semiconductors;flicker noise;micromechanical resonators;oscillators;phase noise;piezoelectric devices;silicon;wide band gap semiconductors","AlN-Si;MEMS oscillators;Si;acoustic wave resonator;amplifier flicker-noise contribution;forced nonlinearity;frequency 23 MHz;increased resonator filter;inplane shear mode resonator;phase noise shaping;piezoelectrical actuated micromechanical oscillator","","5","","12","","","23-27 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
