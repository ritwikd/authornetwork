Once the target microbe is trapped at the focal point of the laser manipulator, we can easily realize exclusion of excess microbes by controlling the electric field, while keeping the target trapped at the focal point. To realize an efficient separation system, we made a new separation cell by microfabrication. We show experimental results on our system. We also propose indirect manipulation methods by the micro-tools to avoid direct laser radiation to the target. Some preliminary experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness.

In the experimental study, we fabricate two different microdiffuser prototypes, having the neck widths of 100 μm (D100) and 300 μm (D300), respectively. The prototypes, D100 and D300, show the maximum net flow rates of 116.6 μl/min and 344.4 μl/min, respectively, for an identical piezoelectric flow actuation using the sinusoidal drive voltage of 100 V p-p at 50 Hz.

The experimental flow rate of D300, however, decreases from 47% of the theoretical values at the flow frequencies higher than 90 Hz, at which the net boundary layer thickness is reduced to the microdiffuser neck width.

The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating. The relationship between the required magnetic field and the rotating frequency is investigated","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838508","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Cobalt alloys;Frequency;Glass;Magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic fields;Magnetic films;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Soft magnetic materials;Torque","attitude control;drag;electromagnetic actuators;electroplating;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic thin films;microactuators;torque","1.6 mg;2 mm;CoNi;MEMS;alternating magnetic field;attitude stability;disk;drag;electroplated alloy;glass rod;large-sized model;lift;magnetic anisotropic torque;micro-flight mechanism;micro-rotational wings;scale effect;soft magnetic films;thrust;wing length;wing-longitudinal flow","","0","","6","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thermomigration is a potentially high-throughput process that is consistent with batch fabrication principles, avoids the necessity of a handle wafer, and retains the mechanical integrity of single crystal silicon. By use of this process, electrically isolated sensors and actuators can be fabricated from a single wafer of silicon.

Droplets featuring volumes down to 1nl aligned in a 500 μm grid are simultaneously ejected by applying a steep air pressure ramp to the open upper side of the liquid. Each of these nozzles is connected to a distinct fluidic reservoir constituting the interface to the macro world. To allow an automated replenishing of the chip, the alignment of the reservoirs is amenable for liquid handling via standard pipetting robots. Depending on the design of the print head, a maximum of 20 μl can be stored thus allowing one to dispend about 20.000 droplets of equal quality in a row. Besides its suitability for a robust biochip manufacturing facility in the laboratory, the print head is also well-integrable in a high-throughput production plant.

Microchannels were realized by bonding a glass wafer to the silicon substrate, resulting in a transparent cover for flow visualization. Phase change during the boiling process was studied under forced convection conditions, where DI water was used as the working fluid. No boiling plateau, associated with latent heat, has been observed in the boiling curves of microchannel heat sinks. Flow visualization was carried out to understand the boiling mechanism in such a system. Three phase-change modes were observed depending on the input power level. Local nucleation boiling within the microchannels occurred at low power level. At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system.

It is found that irregular instability and the inhomogeneous distribution of electric field develop micro-discharges. The micro-discharge evaporates an electrode material, results in increasing the pressure in the gap, finally grows up to the breakdown. This effect is seemed to be remarkable, especially in narrow gaps. Furthermore, the electric breakdown threshed depends on the electrode material.

The damping force is caused by viscous friction of the gas film between a moving mirror plate and the electrodes. The grooves decrease the damping force and enable the moving plate to be driven at high speed and low driving voltage. To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves. For that purpose, the idea of hydraulic mean depth is introduced and is applied to the Reynolds equation. The calculated damping force shows good agreement with the measured damping force of the developed torsion mirror actuator for optical heads","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838559","","Damping;Electrodes;Electrostatic actuators;Electrostatic analysis;Equations;Force measurement;Friction;High speed optical techniques;Low voltage;Mirrors","damping;electrostatic devices;friction;micro-optics;mirrors;viscosity","Reynolds equation;air-film viscosity;damping characteristics;damping force;deep grooves;driving voltage;gas film;hydraulic mean depth;micro electrostatic torsion mirror;moving mirror plate;optical heads;sidewalls;torsion mirror actuator;viscous friction","","0","","10","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The slow response agrees well with that of the rotating micro-actuators fabricated in this work. On the other hand, based on heat transfer analyses, a theoretical response time of the order of a few milli-seconds should be possible for scaled microactuators, thus implying a frequency performance of at least a few hundred Hz. Therefore it is concluded that the response of SMA micro-actuators may not be limited by heat transfer, but by the slow rate of phase transformation between the austenitic and the martensitic phases.

As a rule of thumb, if one can't see a tenfold advantage in some parameter of importance, such as performance or cost, the likelihood of successful adoption is low. Several MEMS devices have emerged that have significant commercial importance. Several others appear to be on the threshold of commercial success.
