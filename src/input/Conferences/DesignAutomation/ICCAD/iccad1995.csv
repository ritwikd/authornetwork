This property (called replaceability) is automatically satisfied in the absence of don't cares because ""correctness"" by definition implies that specification and implementation compute the identical function. However don't cares allow an implementation to compute a different function, and thus make it difficult to ensure replaceability. Whether this problem occurs depends on the exact meaning of ""don't care"" and the associated definition of ""correctness"". We will consider three meanings of ""don't care"" and for each give conditions under which correct implementations may replace their specifications.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.479996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479996","","Decoding;Delay;Law;Legal factors;Logic design;Signal synthesis","logic CAD;logic design","correctness;don't cares;replaceability;specifications","","7","5","11","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme encodes deterministic test sets at distinctly lower costs than previously known approaches. In this paper it is shown how this scheme can be supported during test pattern generation. The presented ATPG algorithm generates test sets which can be encoded very efficiently. Experiments show that the area required for synthesizing a BIST scheme that encodes these patterns is significantly less than the area needed for storing a compact test set. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach of combining ATPG and BIST synthesis leads to a considerably reduced hardware overhead compared to encoding a conventionally generated test set.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.479997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479997","","Automatic test pattern generation;Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Encoding;Hardware;System testing;Test pattern generators","built-in self test;logic testing;shift registers","built-in self-test;deterministic BIST;linear feedback shift registers;test pattern generation;test set","","64","31","27","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using existing techniques, the transistor-level circuit is converted into a relation that describes the evolution of the signals in the circuit with respect to the simulator clock. This simulation relation is then manipulated to derive the stable behavior of the circuit. Given this stable behavior and information about the clocking scheme, we determine if the circuit is combinational, asynchronous or synchronous. For combinational and synchronous circuits we derive an equivalent register-transfer level model. This development enables full-custom circuit designers to use tools that were till now available only to designers working at the gate-level. The algorithm has been successfully used to characterize several custom designs, as well as the entire AT&T standard-cell library.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.479879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479879","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Computational modeling;Design optimization;Logic circuits;Pattern matching;Software libraries;Switches;Voltage","circuit analysis computing;combinational circuits","AT&T standard-cell library;RTL models extraction;combinational circuits;equivalent register-transfer level model;full-custom circuit designers;register-transfer level model;simulator clock;synchronous circuits;transistor netlists;transistor-level circuit","","8","5","8","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although state-based models (such as finite state machines) are a powerful formalism to describe the behavior of sequential systems, they cannot explicitly express the notions of concurrency, causality and conflict Petri nets can naturally capture these notions. The proposed method in based on deriving an elementary transition system (ETS) from a specification model. Previous work has shown that for any ETS there exists a Petri net with minimum transition count (one transition for each label) with a reachability graph isomorphic to the original ETS. This paper presents the first known approach to obtain an ETS from a non-elementary TS and derive a place-irredundant Petri net. Furthermore, by imposing constraints on the synthesis method, different classes of Petri nets can be derived from the same reachability graph (pure, free choice, unique choice). This method has been implemented and efficiently applied in different frameworks: Petri net composition, synthesis of Petri nets from asynchronous circuits, and resynthesis of Petri nets.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480008","","Asynchronous circuits;Automata;Buildings;Carbon capture and storage;Circuit synthesis;Concurrent computing;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Merging;Petri nets","Petri nets;asynchronous circuits;finite state machines;logic CAD","Petri nets synthesis;elementary transition system;finite state machines;labeled Petri nets;reachability graph;sequential systems;specification model;state-based models","","11","1","13","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our unified approach, the max-flow min-cut provides an optimal ordered partition subject to the given seeds and the eigenvector placement provides heuristic information for seed selection. Experimental results on MCNC benchmarks show that our approach is superior to other methods for both linear placement and partitioning problems.

The provably optimal bounds for the maximum cardinality of the set of controllable and observable variables for a given design specification are derived. A polynomial time complexity synthesis algorithm for achieving the bounds is developed.

These techniques are applied at various levels of design (synthesis, placement, routing etc.) to yield clock distribution networks of acceptable skew for the two different clock design styles used by PowerPC processors.

The motivation is to deactivate the memory refresh circuitry, apply power down or disable the clock signals during the inactive periods of operation of circuit elements, and thus minimize the power consumption. Since it is impractical to have a separate set of control signals for each circuit element (otherwise, the control itself would consume a lot of power), it is advisable to partition a circuit based on the activity patterns of its elements so that the partitions can be switched into sleep mode for long periods of time. In this paper, we formulate this partitioning problem and show that it is NP-hard. We present Geo-Part, a geometric partitioning heuristic for this problem.

However, state-of-the art state minimizers cannot handle large ISFSMs or PNDFSMs. In addition, these exploitation techniques are at the symbolic level, not directly at the net-list logic level. We present a general approach to exploit exact or approximate flexibility directly at the net-list logic level, and we demonstrate that many sequential logic optimization techniques can be applied in exploitation. Moreover, we propose a new procedure for input don't care sequences. As a result, both computation and exploitation of input don't care sequences in larger FSM networks can be made efficient and effective.

The reduced circuits are guaranteed to be stable. The experiment results show that the number of circuit elements in a reduced network is O(N) for typical clock networks, where N is the number of external ports.

High accuracy is achieved by considering the dependency of the signal probability and switching activity on each primary input. High speed is also achieved by using the incremental approach for probability calculation. Our approach is able to handle large circuits, since it does not need to construct global BDDs for the probability calculation.

We present an algorithm which attempts to maximize the benefit of this architectural feature.

We show how to implement arithmetic operations efficiently for hybrid decision diagrams. In practice, this is one of the main limitations of BMDs since performing arithmetic operations on functions expressed in this notation can be very expensive. In order to extend symbolic model checking algorithms to handle arithmetic properties, it is essential to be able to compute the BDD for the set of variable assignments that satisfy an arithmetic relation.

Both techniques use stochastic analysis to combine a small number of simulations in order to quantify average energy per external signal transition. The first technique uses N-valued simulation to derive mathematically tight upper and lower bounds of energy consumption. Using this technique we bound the effect of hazards under all possible operating conditions and environments for a given circuit. Additionally, to drive synthesis tools for low-power we propose a second technique that uses fixed-delay simulation to derive a realistic estimate of energy consumption within our derived upper and lower bounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of both these techniques on a variety of burst-mode control circuits used in an industrial-quality chip.

Digest of Technical Papers., 1995 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020806","1995","","","310","317","We present several techniques for accelerating dynamic vector compaction for combinational and sequential circuits. A key feature of all our techniques is that they significantly improve the computation times without adversely affecting the quality of test sets that can be derived using state-of-the-art compaction methods. Our techniques are based on three key ideas: (1) identification of support sets, (2) target fault switching, and (3) use of dynamic equivalent and untestable fault analysis, All these techniques are useful in significantly reducing the number of faults that have to be considered by a test generator or a fault simulator in a dynamic vector compaction system. For fault simulation, support sets quickly identify a large subset of faults that are guaranteed to be undetectable by a given input sequence. For test generation, support sets identify a large subset of faults that are guaranteed to be undetectable by any extension of a partially specified test sequence. Experimental results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits and large production VLSI circuits are included. For full scan designs, our acceleration techniques reduce the overall computation times by a factor of 2 to 3 without adversely affecting the quality (size) of the computed test sets or their fault coverages. The improvement factors obtained are higher for larger circuits. The acceleration techniques enabled the computation of compact test sets for large production circuits that the base test generation system was unable to process in more than 2 CPU days on a Silicon Graphics MIPS 4400 workstation. Results for sequential circuits also show that our acceleration techniques significantly improve the computation times for dynamic vector compaction.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480134","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Compaction;Fault diagnosis;Life estimation;Sequential circuits;System testing","combinational circuits;fault diagnosis;logic CAD;logic testing;sequential circuits","ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits;combinational circuits;computation times;dynamic vector compaction;fault analysis;fault simulation;sequential circuits;target fault switching;test generation","","13","","15","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, the minimum lower bound into which a given netlist can be partitioned is determined by disregarding the logic interconnect while distributing the logic nodes into a minimum number of devices. PROP paradigm challenges this assumption by demonstrating feasible partitions of some large netlists such that the number of device partitions is smaller than minimum lower bounds postulated initially. Overall, we report consistent reductions in the total number of partitions for a wide range of combinational and sequential circuit benchmarks while, on the average, reducing critical path delay as well.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480197","","Clustering algorithms;Costs;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Logic devices;Partitioning algorithms;Sequential circuits;World Wide Web","field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;logic partitioning;programmable logic arrays","FPGA netlists;PROP;combinational circuit;partitioning;recursive paradigm;recursive partitioning;sequential circuit","","5","1","25","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their optimal min-cut replication algorithm does not guarantee min-cut replication sets of minimum sizes. Furthermore, their algorithm is not optimal for hypergraphs. In this paper, we optimally solve the min-area min-cut replication problem on digraphs, which is to find min-cut replication sets with the minimum sizes. More importantly, we give an optimal solution to the hypergraph min-area min-cut replication problem using a much smaller flow network model.

Researchers have found that many tasks can be expressed as series of operations on Boolean functions, making them candidates for OBDD-based methods. The success of OBDDs has inspired efforts to improve their efficiency and to expand their range of applicability. Techniques have been discovered to make the representation more compact and to represent other classes of functions. This has led to improved performance on existing OBDD applications, as well as enabled new classes of problems to be solved.

Technology mapping approaches in the existing literature cannot handle these selectors, due to the restriction of I-hot encoding of the control signals. We present a new algorithm to address this problem, which is based an the novel idea of a general Boolean Oracle. Our oracle is based on ATPG techniques, and compared to BDDs, the oracle has the advantage that failure to complete only affects optimization locally, and does not hinder optimization elsewhere in the logic. A limitation of BDDs is that it is difficult to complete the algorithm if a BDD grows too large.

Analogous to a paradigm successfully used for the optimal encoding of synchronous machines, the problem is formulated as an input encoding problem. Implementations are targeted to sum-of-product realizations.

Conditions are derived for a gate to be completely testable for GSEs. These conditions lend to small rest sets for GSEs. Near-minimal test sets are also derived for GCEs. We analyze redundancy in design errors and relate this to single stuck-line (SSL) redundancy. We show how to map all the foregoing error types into SSL faults, and describe an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed method. Our experiments demonstrate that high coverage of the modeled design errors can be achieved with small test sets.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480009","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Computer errors;Formal verification;Ice;Inverters;Logic testing;Redundancy","automatic testing;circuit analysis computing;combinational circuits;logic testing;redundancy","automatic test pattern generation;combinational design verification;conventional ATPG tools;design errors;design verification;error models;gate count errors;gate substitution errors;input count errors;near-minimal test sets;redundancy;simulation-based method;single stuck-line redundancy;specified design errors;wrong input errors","","23","","11","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed model allows multiple dominant signals associated with the state of a node. The strength of several logical low and high signal contributions can thereby be taken into account when the logic state of a node is computed, which means that intermediate voltages can be handled more accurately. To demonstrate the usefulness of the multiple-dominance model in fault simulations, a new fault simulation algorithm is presented. Various common transistor-level fault types were simulated, and the results show that the number of discrepancies from electrical-level simulations is significantly reduced at a low computational cost.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480202","","Analytical models;CMOS technology;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Discrete event simulation;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic;Predictive models;Semiconductor device modeling;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;circuit analysis computing;discrete event simulation;fault diagnosis;logic testing","CMOS networks;event-driven switch-level simulation;fault simulation;multiple-dominance model;short faults;simulation;switch-level model;switch-level simulation;transistor-level fault types","","3","","21","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to be efficiently combined with transistor circuitry in a SPICE-level simulation, reduced-order models which have accurate low-frequency behavior must be constructed. Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) or Pade-via-Lanczos (PVL) algorithms can not be used directly to construct the reduced-order models from the surface-volume formulation, because the formulation generates dense matrices which are too expensive to factor. In this paper we describe a two-level approach to efficiently generating reduced-order models with accurate low frequency behavior. First, reduced-order models which match Taylor series terms at s=/spl infin/ are efficiently generated from the surface-volume formulation using an Arnoldi method, and then these fairly high-order models are used to efficiently construct lower-order models which snatch Taylor series terms at s=0. Examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the resultant low-order model.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.479988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479988","","Circuit simulation;Conductors;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Jacobian matrices;Laplace equations;Linear systems;Reduced order systems;Taylor series","circuit analysis computing;integrated circuit interconnections;series (mathematics);transient analysis","Arnoldi method;SPICE-level simulation;Taylor series terms;integrated circuit interconnect;reduced-order modeling;reduced-order models;surface-volume methods;three-dimensional interconnect;transient simulation","","1","","11","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional methods for instruction selection use heuristics that break up the DAG into a forest of trees and then cover them independently. This breakup can result in suboptimal solutions for the original DAG. Alternatively, the DAG covering problem can be formulated as a binate covering problem, and solved exactly or heuristically using branch-and-bound methods. We show that optimal instruction selection on a PAG in the case of accumulator-based architectures requires a partial scheduling of nodes in the DAG, and we augment the binate covering formulation to minimize spills and reloads.

A serial fault emulation algorithm is employed and enhanced by two speed-up techniques. First, a set of independent faults can be emulated in parallel. Second, simultaneous injection of multiple dependent faults is also possible by adding extra supporting circuitry. Because the reconfiguration time spent on mapping the numerous faulty circuits into the FPGA boards could be the bottleneck of the whole process, using extra logic for injecting a large number of faults per configuration can reduce the number of reconfigurations, and thus, significantly improve the efficiency. Some modeling issues that are unique in the fault emulation environment are also addressed.

From this universal set, a minimal number of measurements is automatically selected that represent a set of observations characterizing the state of the circuit under test with respect to parametric faults. A parametric fault model is introduced which is related to the individual circuit specifications. For each given circuit specification, a corresponding test inference criterion is computed, based on logistic discrimination analysis. By applying these criteria, the satisfaction or violation of the given circuit specifications can be inferred from the observations of the circuit under test.

The complex nature of power as a cost function implies that the effects of several behavioral synthesis tasks like module selection, clock selection, scheduling and resource sharing on supply voltage and switched capacitance need to be considered simultaneously to fully derive the benefits of design space exploration at the behavior level. We present an efficient algorithm for performing scheduling, clock selection, module selection, and resource allocation and assignment simultaneously with an aim of reducing the power consumption in the synthesized data path. The algorithm, which is based on an iterative improvement strategy, is capable of escaping local minima in its search for a low power solution. The algorithm considers diverse module libraries and complex scheduling constructs such as multicycling chaining, and structural pipelining. We describe supply voltage and clock pruning strategies that significantly improve the efficiency of our algorithm by cutting down on the computational effort involved in exploring candidate supply voltages and clock periods that are unlikely to lead to the best solution. Experimental results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Our techniques can be combined with other known methods of behavioral power optimization like data path replication and transformations, to result in a complete data path synthesis system for low power applications.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480190","","Capacitance;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Cost function;Energy consumption;Iterative algorithms;Resource management;Scheduling algorithm;Space exploration;Voltage","VLSI;circuit CAD;data flow computing;iterative methods","behavioral synthesis;data path replication;data path synthesis system;data-dominated circuits;iterative improvement algorithm;low power data path synthesis;resource allocation;resource sharing;scheduling;structural pipelining","","35","2","11","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Solutions with accurate delay evaluation which consider input signal slopes and separately evaluate rising and falling delays are obtained after several iterative steps. A speedup technique is used to pick out gates actually involved in each local sizing step so as to reduce CPU time. Experiments on sample circuits show that our approach can provide solutions with smaller circuit area than conventional approaches for the same circuit delay or provide solutions under tight delay constraints where conventional approaches can nor reach. Moreover, our approach is faster than the conventional approaches for most circuits, especially under loose delay constraints.","1092-3152","0-8186-8200-0","","10.1109/ICCAD.1995.480150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=480150","","Central Processing Unit;Circuit testing;Constraint optimization;Delay effects;Iterative methods;Linear approximation;Linear programming;Piecewise linear approximation;Piecewise linear techniques;Timing","VLSI;iterative methods;logic CAD;logic design","delay evaluation;gate sizing;iterative gate sizing;linear programming;speedup technique","","8","","10","","","5-9 Nov. 1995","05 Nov 1995-09 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The contributions of This work are as follows: (i) we consider the potential node duplications during the cut enumeration/generation procedure so the mapping costs encoded in the cuts drive the area-optimization objective more effectively; (ii) after the timing constraint is determined, we will relax the non-critical paths by searching the solution space considering both local and global optimality information to minimize mapping area; (iii) an iterative cut selection procedure is carried out that further explores and perturbs the solution space to improve solution quality. We guarantee optimal mapping depth under the unit delay model. Experimental results show that our mapping algorithm, named DAOmap, produces significant quality and runtime improvements. Compared to the state-of-the-art depth-optimal, area minimization mapping algorithm CutMap (Cong and Hwan, 1995), DAOmap is 16.02% better on area and runs 24.2X faster on average when both algorithms are mapping to FPGAs using LUTs of five inputs.

However, there has been no easy way of optimizing (1) and (2) simultaneously at an early stage of the synthesis process.

In general, there are many possible partitioning solutions with the minimum cut size and the difference of their required amounts of replication can be significant. Since there is a size constraint on each component of the partitioning in practice, it is desirable to also minimize the amount of replication. In this paper, we present a network-flow based algorithm to determine an optimum replication min-cut partitioning that requires minimum replication. We show that the algorithm can be generalized to separate two given subsets of nodes and determine an optimum partitioning of the minimum possible cut size using the least possible amount of replication.
