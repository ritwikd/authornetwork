"IR-drop based electromigration assessment: Parametric failure chip-scale analysis","Sukharev, V.; Xin Huang; Hai-Bao Chen; Tan, S.X.-D.","Mentor Graphics Corp., Fremont, CA, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","428","433","This paper presents a novel approach and techniques for electromigration (EM) assessment in power delivery networks. An increase in the voltage drop above the threshold level, caused by EM-induced increase in resistances of the individual interconnect segments, is considered as a failure criterion. This criterion replaces a currently employed conservative weakest segment criterion, which does not account an essential redundancy for current propagation existing in the power-ground (p/g) networks. EM-induced increase in the resistance of the individual grid segments is described in the approximation of the physics-based formalism for void nucleation and growth. A developed technique for calculating the hydrostatic stress distribution inside a multi branch interconnect tree allows to avoid over optimistic prediction of the time to failure made with the Blech-Black analysis of individual branches of interconnect segment. Experimental results obtained on the IBM benchmark circuit validate the proposed methods.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001387","IR-drop;electromigration;failure;power-ground networks;void","Current density;Integrated circuit interconnections;Metals;Power grids;Reliability;Resistance;Stress","electromigration;failure analysis;integrated circuit interconnections;reliability","Blech-Black analysis;conservative weakest segment criterion;current propagation;electromigration assessment;hydrostatic stress distribution;interconnect segments;multi branch interconnect tree;parametric failure chip-scale analysis;physics-based formalism;power delivery networks;power-ground networks;redundancy;void growth;void nucleation;voltage drop","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Escalating costs of semiconductor technology and its lagging performance relative to historic trends is motivating acceleration and specialization as more impactful means to increase system value. Targeted specialization is being increasingly pursued as an important way to achieve dramatic improvements in workload acceleration. This requires a broad understanding of workloads, system structures, and algorithms to determine what to accelerate / specialize, and how, i.e., via SW?; via HW?; or via SW+HW? which presents many choices, necessitating co-optimization of SW and HW. In this talk, we will focus on an application driven approach to high level design for software and system co-optimization, based on inventing new software algorithms, that have strong affinity to hardware acceleration.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001331","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Market research;Software;Software algorithms","distributed processing;hardware-software codesign","application driven high level design;hardware acceleration;heterogeneous computing;semiconductor technology;software algorithm;software-hardware co-optimization;workload acceleration","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to minimize the Edge Placement Error (EPE) and the process variability of the printed image. The algorithm is also adapted to reduce the computational time using a novel approach through minimizing the number of convolutions during lithography simulation time.

"Common path pessimism removal: An industry perspective: Special Session: Common Path Pessimism Removal","Garg, V.","Cadence Design Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","592","595","Process parameters, e.g., transistor width, may greatly vary not only across multiple manufacturing lots, but also within the same die from the same manufacturing lot. In addition to process variations different parts of a chip may see different voltages and temperatures. These process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations are termed as On-Chip Variations (OCV) and can unsystematically affect wire and cell delays. This variability is accounted for by adding OCV de-ratings to path delays during static timing analysis (STA), where the original timing values are split into early (lowerbound) and late (upperbound) quantities. Chip timing is then done against these new delays to ensure safe chip operation. Any unknown or hard-to-model variation effect can also be margined for in these OCV de-ratings. However, this additional pessimism can significantly increase the difficulty to achieve timing closure, thereby elongating the design cycle and time to market. In particular, excess pessimism along clock network creates the most design-cycle churn, as pessimistic clock delays impact nearly all data paths. This session discusses the overview and challenges of common path pessimism removal (CPPR), the method of safely removing excess pessimism from clock paths, from an industry perspective.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001412","CPPR;pessimism removal;static timing analysis","Clocks;Complexity theory;Delays;Industries;Optimization;Registers","clocks;delay circuits;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;synchronisation;time to market","CPPR;OCV deratings;PVT variations;STA;cell delays;chip operation;chip timing;clock network;clock paths;common path pessimism removal;design-cycle churn;manufacturing lots;on-chip variations;path delays;pessimistic clock delays;process parameters;process-voltage-temperature variations;static timing analysis;time to market;timing closure;transistor width","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This greedy search method uses essential and secondary essential primes, does not require solving the covering problem, is fast, and produces high quality results. We compare it to other synthesis methods, such as the modified SOP and Exclusive-Or Sum of Products (ESOP) with minimum number of working memristors.

"Opportunistic through-silicon-via inductor utilization in LC resonant clocks: Concept and algorithms","Tida, U.R.; Mittapalli, V.; Cheng Zhuo; Yiyu Shi","Missouri S&T, Rolla, MO, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","750","757","LC resonant clock is an attracting option for low power on-chip clock distribution designs. However, a major limiting factor to its implementation is the large area overhead due to the conventional spiral inductors. On the other hand, idle through-silicon-vias (TSVs) in three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) can form vertical inductors with minimal footprint and little noise coupling with horizontal traces, particularly suitable for the application of LC resonant clock. However, due to the strict constraints on the location of idle TSVs, the use of the TSV inductor is limited by the constrained choices of its location, inductance and quality factor. Moreover, these TSV inductors can be in any orientation with any distance apart, thereby causing complicated coupling effects. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to opportunistically use idle TSVs to form inductors in LC resonant clock of 3D ICs for maximum power reduction. We formulate the problem and devise a greedy algorithm to efficiently solve it. Experimental results on a few industrial designs show that compared with the conventional resonant clock designs using spiral inductors, our scheme with TSV inductors can reduce the inductor footprint by up to 6.30x with the same power consumption. Especially these TSV inductors are formed by existing idle TSVs so they essentially come for free. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the very first work to apply TSV inductors to the resonant CDN.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001435","","Capacitors;Clocks;Inductance;Inductors;Q-factor;Through-silicon vias;Wires","LC circuits;clock distribution networks;clocks;inductors;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;three-dimensional integrated circuits","LC resonant clocks;low power on-chip clock distribution designs;maximum power reduction;three dimensional integrated circuits;through silicon via inductor utilization;vertical inductors","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among various types of energy loads in buildings, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and EV (electric vehicle) charging are two of the most important ones and have distinct characteristics. HVAC system accounts for 50% of the building energy consumption and typically operates throughout the day, while EV charging is an emerging major energy load that is hard to predict and may cause spikes in energy demand. To maximize building energy efficiency and grid stability, it is important to address both types of energy loads in a holistic framework. Furthermore, on the supply side, the utilization of multiple energy sources such as grid electricity, solar, wind, and battery storage provides more opportunities for energy efficiency, and should be considered together with the scheduling of energy loads. In this paper, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC) based algorithm to co-schedule HVAC control, EV scheduling and battery usage for reducing the total building energy consumption and the peak energy demand, while maintaining the temperature within the comfort zone for building occupants and meeting the deadlines for EV charging. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under a variety of demand, supply and environment constraints.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001351","","Batteries;Buildings;Energy consumption;Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Prediction algorithms","HVAC;building management systems;electric vehicles;energy conservation;power consumption;power grids;power system stability;predictive control;scheduling;secondary cells","EV charging schedulling;HVAC control coscheduling;MPC based algorithm;battery usage;building energy consumption reduction;building energy efficiency maximisation;electric vehicle charging;energy demand spike;energy load;grid stability;heating, ventilation, and air conditioning;multiple energy source utilization;predictive control based algorithm","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently proposed 3D vertical cross-point ReRAM (3D-VRAM) architecture is an encouraging development in ReRAM's evolution as a cost-competitive solution, and thus attracts a lot of attention in both industry and academia. In this work, an array-level model to estimate the read/write energy and characterize the vertical access transistor is developed. We use the model to study a range of design trade-offs by tuning the cell-level characteristics and the read/write schemes. The design space exploration addresses several critical issues that are either unique to 3D-VRAM or have substantially different concerns from the 2D cross-point array design. It provides insights on the design optimizations of the array density and access energy, and several important conclusions have been reached. Then we propose multi-directional write driver to mitigate the writer circuitry overhead, and use remote sensing scheme to take full advantage of limited on-die sensing resources. The benefits of these optimizations are evaluated and validated in our macro-architecture model. With trace-based simulations, system-level comparisons between 3D-VRAM and a wide spectrum of memories are performed in mixed aspects of performance, cost, and energy. The results show that our optimized 3D-VRAM design are better than other contenders for storage memory in both performance and energy.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001329","","Arrays;Electrodes;Microprocessors;Resistance;Sensors;Transistors","NAND circuits;flash memories;logic design;resistive RAM","2D cross-point array design;3D vertical cross-point ReRAM;3D vertical resistive memory;3D-VRAM architecture;NAND flash technology;macroarchitecture model;next-generation storage systems;on-die sensing resources;remote sensing scheme;resistive random access memory;trace-based simulations;vertical access transistor","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Phase Change Memory (PCM) has shown its potential in replacing DRAM as the main memory option due to its (65%) reduced energy requirements. However, when considering the usage of PCM main memory, its write endurance becomes a critical issue, and wear leveling design is a common approach to resolve this issue. Even though the wear leveling design should stress operation efficiency and overhead reduction, existing wear leveling strategies designed for PCM main memory are usually dedicated to prolonging the lifetime of PCM. In this paper, we propose the perspective that, instead of valuing PCM lifetime exploitation as the first priority, we should turn to satisfy the product warranty period. To this end, further enhancement of operation efficiency and reduction of management overhead could be achieved. We thus propose a warranty-aware page management design to enhance the operation efficiency for managing the endurance issue in PCM. To show the effectiveness of the proposed design, we collected real traces on fiasco. OC by running SPEC2006 benchmarks with different write intensity workloads. The experiment results showed that our design reduced the overhead to one third of that of the state-of-the-art designs while still providing the same level of performance.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001433","","Arrays;Memory management;Phase change materials;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Warranties","embedded systems;phase change memories;storage management chips","PCM-based embedded systems;management overhead reduction;nonvolatile memory;operation efficiency enhancement;phase change memory;warranty-aware page management","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These capabilities include not only additional design rules, or additional modeling capabilities, or incremental verification tools, but rather a qualitatively new set of DFM/DEM (Design For Manufacturing - Design Enabled Manufacturing) methodologies aimed at variability management, i.e. at characterization and remapping of systematic variability effects caused by design/process interaction. A typical example is a “correct by construction” router flow, augmented with yield detractor and yield enhancer patterns, implemented for 20nm high performance processor designs. In such a flow, timing (on the design side) and yield (on the manufacturing side) are co-optimized, in order to guarantee high yield and specified parametric performance in the first silicon run. In spite of current successes the incremental path down to 14nm will be disrupted, because of the hard physical limits simultaneously occurring in geometric scaling and electrical scaling, and the transition to 10 and 7 nm nodes will require a (re)volutionary DFM (Design For Manufacturing) paradigm. Building on the state-of-the-art in design/technology co-optimization this work will review the three most likely design/process scenarios for 10 and 7nm design enablement, which could potentially allow the synthesis of the “design gap” and “patterning gap” altogether.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001407","","Design automation;Design methodology;Integrated circuit modeling;Manufacturing;Solid modeling;Systematics","design for manufacture;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;microprocessor chips","DEM;DFM;IC process technology;ITRS;design enabled manufacturing;design for manufacturing;design-aware yield engineering;electrical scaling;geometric scaling;physical verification methodologies;process-aware physical design;processor designs;size 10 nm;size 14 nm;size 20 nm;size 28 nm;size 7 nm","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results illustrate that enHyV reduces on-chip static memory energy compared to SRAM-only version of enHyV and to state-of-art AMBER hybrid video memory [9] by 66%-75% and 55%-76%, respectively.

We present a HW/SW co-validation framework to validate DMA interface implementations of a device and its driver. This framework employs a virtual prototype of the device as a reference model and performs co-validation in two stages: (1) conformance checking which checks the DMA interface conformance between the device and its virtual prototype; (2) property checking which checks device/driver interactions across the DMA interface. In conformance checking, the virtual prototype infers the device state transitions by taking the same driver request sequence to the device. Property checking verifies system properties over the device state transitions exposed through the virtual prototype. This framework assists HW/SW integration validation by detecting DMA interface bugs in both devices and drivers. Furthermore, we have developed three key techniques: capture-on-write policy, partial capture, and environmental input prediction, to address two major challenges in scaling the framework: DMA capture overhead and imprecise environmental input simulation. We have applied this approach to four Ethernet adapters, discovering 12 serious DMA interface bugs from the devices, their virtual prototypes and their drivers.

Thermal interactions between on-chip heat-sources and ring resonators pose significant operational and integration challenges, as these devices are extremely sensitive to temperature-induced changes in refractive index. Contemporary literature proposes active compensation for such refractive index variations (e.g. carrier-injection based tuning and/or WDM channel remapping); however, these are costly in terms of power and area. This paper presents a thermal-aware synthesis approach for ring-resonator compensation. We show how ring-resonators are analyzed in the presence of external thermal gradients, and employ a perturbation analysis to derive an equivalent, trimming-enabled, ring-resonator design. Our methodology produces a design-template that can be used to compensate for thermal variations through modifications to the waveguide's geometric structure. This approach complements active compensation techniques, and the synthesis is compatible with contemporary lithographic methods. Using this approach, we perform design space exploration with respect to variations to the waveguide structure and their effect on the range and precision of thermal compensation.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001405","","Indexes;Materials;Optical ring resonators;Optical waveguides;Refractive index;Tuning","integrated optics;optical interconnections;optical resonators;optical waveguides;refractive index;thermo-optical effects;wavelength division multiplexing","WDM channel remapping;carrier-injection based tuning;integrated photonic ring resonators;integration challenges;on-chip heat-sources;on-chip optical-interconnect wavelength division multiplexing;refractive index;refractive index variations;ring-resonator compensation;temperature-induced changes;thermal-aware synthesis;thermal-aware synthesis approach","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it remains unclear how effective these materials are in the context of realistic microprocessor floorplan and workloads. Moreover, these TE materials suffer from contact parasitics that can significantly impact their performance. To evaluate the workload dependent performance of on-chip TE devices, we developed a hierarchical simulation methodology that connects an architectural simulator and a power estimation tool with a thermal simulator capable of simulating TE devices. The well-known HotSpot thermal simulator is modified to incorporate TE equations along with contact parasitics in the TE module. SimpleScalar and McPAT were used to generate the runtime power of different functional units in an Out-of-Order processor across the SPEC2000 workloads. The power-map generated by McPAT is used by our TE enhanced HotSpot simulator to evaluate the cooling and harvesting capabilities of on-chip TE modules. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain 11°C peak cooling at the hot-spots, or harvest upto 85mW of power from the hot-spots. We also show that on-chip TE devices can aid in boosting the clock frequency of the processor from 1200MHz to 1600MHz under iso-temperature comparison with the no-TE case. This framework also allows for the rapid design space exploration of TE module's material/physical parameters and the optimum placement options for the TE module on the chip floorplan.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001402","Thin-Film Thermoelectrics;cooling;energy harvesting;floorplan;frequency boosting;workload","Clocks;Cooling;Equations;Heating;Materials;Mathematical model;System-on-chip","cooling;energy harvesting;thermoelectric devices;thin film devices","HotSpot thermal simulator;McPAT;Out-of-Order processor;SPEC2000 workloads;SimpleScalar;architectural simulator;chip floorplan;clock frequency;contact parasitics;energy-harvesting;frequency 1200 MHz to 1600 MHz;hierarchical simulation methodology;hot-spots;microprocessor floorplan;on-chip TE devices;on-chip cooling;power estimation tool;rapid design space exploration;temperature 11 C;thin-film thermoelectric materials","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unnecessary pessimism might arise quality-of-result (QoR) concerns such as reporting worse violations than the true timing properties owned by the physical circuit. In other words, signoff timing report will conclude a lower clock frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations. Therefore, we introduce in this paper a fast path-based timing analysis for CPPR. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, we perform implicit path representation which yields significantly smaller search space and faster runtime. Specifically, our algorithm is superior in both space and time saving, from which the memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks released from TAU 2014 timing analysis contest have shown that our algorithm won the first place and achieved the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over all participating teams.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001413","","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Clocks;Design automation;Runtime;Timing","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;timing circuits","CPPR;common-path-pessimism removal;explicit path search;fast path-based timing analysis;implicit path representation;memory storage;quality-of-result","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The portion of applications or tasks to be offloaded for remote processing should be judiciously determined. In this paper, the problem of optimal task dispatch, transmission, and execution in the MCC system is considered. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is applied to the local mobile processor, whereas the RF transmitter of the mobile device can choose from multiple modulation schemes and bit rates. The power consumptions of the mobile components that cannot be directly controlled, e.g., the touch screen, GPU, audio codec, and I/O ports, are also accounted for through capturing their correlation with the mobile processor and RF transmitter. Finally, a realistic and accurate battery model is adopted in this work in order to estimate the battery energy loss rate in a more accurate way. This paper presents a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)-based optimization framework, with the actions of different DVFS levels and modulation schemes/transimission bit rates and the objective of minimizing both the energy drawn from the battery and the average latency in request servicing. This paper derives the optimal solution, including the optimal DVFS policy, offloading rate, and transmission scheme, using linear programming combined with a heuristic search. Experiments are conducted on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Development Platform MSM8660 to find the correlations among the power consumptions of the CPU, RF components, and other components. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal solution consistently outperforms some baseline algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001378","","Batteries;Frequency modulation;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Radio frequency;Transmitters","Markov processes;cloud computing;mobile computing;optimisation","DVFS;MCC;MSM8660;Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile development platform;SMDP-based optimization framework;battery capacity;dynamic voltage;frequency scaling;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;mobile processor;optimal offloading control;realistic battery model;semi-Markov decision process","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 3D ICs, the inter-tier-via (ITV) is a critical enabling technique because it forms vertical signal and power paths. Accordingly, it is imperative to accurately and efficiently extract the electrostatic capacitances of ITVs using field solvers. Unfortunately, the cylindrical via shape presents major challenges to most of the existing methods. To address this issue, we develop a novel floating random walk (FRW) method by rotating the transition cube to suit the cylindrical surface and devising a special space management technique. Experiments on typical ITV structures suggest that the proposed techniques can accelerate the existing FRW and boundary element method (BEM) based algorithms by up to 20X and 180X, respectively, without loss of accuracy. In addition, compared with the naïve square approximation approach, our techniques can reduce the error by 10X.

The resulting interpolant represents the dependency function h, such that f = h(G). Generally, the set G contains enough base functions to enable the existence of multiple dependency functions whose quality mainly depends on which base functions were selected for reconstruction. The interpolation is not an optimisation problem and thus, often, it selects some random base functions and, particularly, omits others potentially required for an optimal implementation of the target function. Mainly, it is impossible to impose that the interpolant uses a specific base function. In this paper, we propose a method that forces a specific base function g<sub>i</sub> as a primary input of a dependency function. Such a dependency function is built as a Shannon expansion of two constrained Craig interpolants for the assignments of the primary inputs for which g<sub>i</sub> evaluates to 0 and 1, respectively. We also introduce a method that iteratively imposes a predefined set of base functions. In each iteration, we generate a new dependency function for use as the target function of the next iteration in order to force the use of a base function. We show that, unlike the standard Craig interpolation method, our carving method succeeds to impose the desired base functions with very high probability. It recomposes single-output logic circuits as their delay- or area-optimised implementations regardless of the input implementation. The proposed methods can be efficiently employed for rewriting circuits in some synthesis-based algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001392","","Boolean functions;Interpolation;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Optimization;Standards;Vectors","interpolation;logic circuits;logic design;probability;random processes","Craig interpolation;Shannon expansion;area-optimised implementation;carving method;constrained interpolation;delay-optimised implementation;guided logic synthesis;interpolant;multiple dependency function;probability;random base function;rewriting circuit;single-output logic circuit;synthesis-based algorithm;target function","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the high routing complexity, it is difficult for existing routing methods to guarantee total completion without design rule checking violations (DRCs) and it generally takes several days for designers to fix remaining DRC-s. Studies has shown that the low routing quality partly results from non-optimal net-ordering nature of traditional sequential methods. In this paper, a novel concurrent detailed routing algorithm is presented that overcomes the net-order problem. Based on the multi-commodity flow (M-CF) method, detailed routing problem with complex design rule constraints is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is capable of reducing design rule violations while introducing no negative effects on wirelength and via count. Implemented as a detailed router following track assignment, the algorithm can reduce the DRCs by 38%, meantime, wirelength and via count are reduced by 3% and 2.7% respectively comparing with an industry tool. Additionally, the algorithm is adopted as an incremental detailed router to refine a routing solution, and experimental results show that the number of DRCs that industry tool can't fix are further reduce by half. Utilizing the independency between subregions, an efficient parallelization algorithm is implemented that can get a close to linear speedup.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001382","DR-C;Design Rule;Detailed Routing;Multi-commodity Flow","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Industries;Mathematical model;Metals;Routing;Wires","VLSI;integer programming;integrated circuit design;linear programming","MCFRoute;VLSI physical design;design rule checking;integer linear programming;router based multi-commodity flow method","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a smart home system, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is used to connect smart meters with the power system and the communication system of a smart grid. The electricity pricing information is transmitted from the utility to the local community, and then broadcast through wired or wireless networks to each smart meter within AMI. In this work, the vulnerability of the above process is assessed. Two closely related pricing cyberattacks which manipulate the guideline electricity prices received at smart meters are considered and they aim at reducing the expense of the cyberattacker and increasing the peak energy usage in the local community. A countermeasure technique which uses support vector regression and impact difference for detecting anomaly pricing is then proposed. These pricing cyberattacks explore the interdependance between the transmitted electricity pricing in the communication system and the energy load in the power system, which are the first such cyber-attacks in the smart home context. Our simulation results demonstrate that the pricing cyberattack can reduce the attacker's bill by 34.3% at the cost of the increase of others' bill by 7.9% on average. In addition, the pricing cyberattack can unbalance the energy load of the local power system as it increases the peak to average ratio by 35.7%. Furthermore, our simulation results show that the proposed countermeasure technique can effectively detect the electricity pricing manipulation.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001350","Advanced Metering Infrastructure;Cyberattack;Cybersecurity;Electricity Pricing Manipulation;Smart Home","Computer crime;Electricity;Energy consumption;Guidelines;Pricing;Smart homes;Smart meters","home computing;power engineering computing;power system economics;pricing;regression analysis;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids;support vector machines","AMI;advanced metering infrastructure;anomaly pricing detection;defense technology;electricity pricing information;electricity pricing manipulation detection;guideline electricity prices;peak energy usage;peak to average ratio;power system energy load;pricing cyberattacks;smart grid infrastructure;smart home cybersecurity;smart meters;support vector regression;vulnerability assessment","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a scalable power grid reduction method for reducing large-scale flip-chip power grids based on recent spectral graph sparsification techniques. The first step of the proposed approach aggressively reduces the large power grid blocks into much smaller power grid blocks by properly matching the effective resistances of the original power grid networks. Next, an efficient spectral graph sparsification scheme is introduced to dramatically sparsify the relatively dense power grid blocks that are generated during the previous step. In the last, an effective grid compensation scheme is proposed to further improve the model accuracy of the reduced and sparsified power grid. Since reduction of each power grid block can be performed independently, our method can be easily accelerated on parallel computers, and therefore expected to be capable of handling large power grid designs as well as incremental designs. Extensive experimental results show that our method can scale linearly with power grid sizes and efficiently reduce industrial power grids sizes by 20X without loss of much accuracy in both DC and transient analysis.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001355","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Ports (Computers);Power grids;Resistance;Vectors","RC circuits;flip-chip devices;graph theory;integrated circuit interconnections;transient analysis","DC analysis;RC reduction method;flip-chip power grids;power grid blocks;power grid networks;power grid reduction method;spectral graph sparsification approach;transient analysis","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, capturing the features of anomalous interruption and then detecting them at real time is difficult for large-scale smart grids, because the measurement data volume and complexity increases drastically with the exponential growth of data from the immense intelligent monitoring devices to be rolled out and the need for fast information retrieval from those mass data. Most of existing anomaly detection methods fail to handle it well. This paper proposes a spatial-temporal correlation based anomalous behavior model to capture the characteristics of anomaly such as transmission line outages in smart grid. Inspired by Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage (LWS) method, we develop the real time anomaly detection (ReTAD) algorithm to overcome the issue of gigantic measurement data volume. The proposed algorithm is not only suitable for large number of power systems with high dimensional measurement data, but at the same time is also low computational complexity to apply for real time detection. Using 14-, 30, and 2383-bus systems, our experimental study demonstrates that our proposed ReTAD algorithm successfully detects the anomalous events at real time.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001352","","Analytical models;Correlation;Covariance matrices;Real-time systems;Time measurement;Transmission line matrix methods;Transmission line measurements","computational complexity;information retrieval;power system faults;power system measurement;power system reliability;smart power grids","LWS method;Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage method;ReTAD algorithm;anomalous interruption detection;computational complexity;data measurement;gigantic data measurement;immense intelligent monitoring device;information retrieval;large-scale smart grids wide area monitoring;power system reliability;real time anomaly detection algorithm;spatial-temporal correlation based anomalous behavior model","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this approach produces an exponential number of explicit timing constraints which is beyond the ability of synchronous placement tools to handle. Thus, synchronous placer can only produce suboptimal results. Also, it can be very costly in terms of runtime. This paper proposed a new placement approach for asynchronous VLSI circuits. We formulated the asynchronous timing-driven placement problem and transform this problem into a weighted wirelength minimization problem based on a Lagrangian relaxation framework. The problem can then be efficiently solved using any standard wirelength-driven placement engine that can handle net weights. We demonstrate our approach on QDI PCHB asynchronous circuit with a state-of-art quadratic placer. The experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively improve the asynchronous circuits performance at placement stage.

As a matter of fact, different aging mechanisms simultaneously occur in the gate dielectric of a transistor. In addition, scaling in conjunction with high-K materials has made aging mechanisms, that have often been assumed to be negligible (e.g., PBTI in NMOS and HCID in PMOS), become noticeable. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the key challenge of providing designers with an abstracted, yet accurate reliability estimation that combines, from the physical to system level, the effects of multiple simultaneous aging mechanisms and their interdependencies. We show that the overall aging can be modeled as a superposition of the interdependent aging effects. Our presented model deviates by around 6% from recent industrial physical measurements. We conclude from our experiments that an isolated treatment of individual aging mechanisms is insufficient to devise effective mitigation strategies in current and upcoming technology nodes. We also demonstrate that estimating reliability due to an individual dominant aging mechanism together with solely considering a single kind of failures, as currently is a main focus of state-of-the-art (e.g., [28], [22]), can result in 75% underestimation on average.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001394","","Aging;Degradation;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit reliability;Random access memory;Transistors","ageing;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;negative bias temperature instability;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability","aging mechanisms;dominant aging mechanism;high-K materials;hot carrier induced degradation;interdependent aging effect superposition;negative bias temperature instability;positive bias temperature instability","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, emerging devices such as heterojunction tunneling FETs are more amenable to vertical fabrication. However, past studies of vertical channel devices focused more on regular memory architectures and simple standard cells like inverter. Since naive migration of regular FinFET layouts to vertical FETs yields little benefits, we identify several vertical efficient layout structures and propose novel layout generation heuristics for vertical channel devices. We also compare VGAA with symmetric and asymmetric source/drain architectures. The layout efficiencies of several VGAA structures, vertical double gate (VDG), lateral gate-all-around (LGAA), and FinFET are presented in our experiments. We observe that even though most vertical channel standard cells have more diffusion gaps than lateral cells do, they still benefit from vertical architectures in area because of the elimination of diffusion contacts. For asymmetric architectures, the area is larger than symmetric architectures because of the extra diffusion gaps needed, but our experiments indicate that for both symmetric and asymmetric architectures, vertical channel devices are likely to have a density advantage over lateral channel devices assuming that current drive strengths of both are similar.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001404","","Bipartite graph;FinFETs;Layout;Logic gates;Standards","MOSFET;tunnel transistors","LGAA;VDG;VGAA structures;asymmetric source-drain architectures;diffusion contact elimination;diffusion gaps;efficient layout generation;heterojunction tunneling FETs;inverter;lateral gate-all-around;layout generation heuristics;layout structures;regular FinFET layouts;regular memory architectures;symmetric source-drain architectures;vertical FETs;vertical channel device evaluation;vertical channel standard cells;vertical double gate;vertical fabrication;vertical gate-all-around","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These conditional probabilities can be efficiently estimated with a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo samples generated by a modified Metropolis algorithm, and then used to calculate the rare failure rate of the circuit. To quantitatively assess the accuracy of SUS, a statistical methodology is further proposed to accurately estimate the confidence interval of SUS based on the theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our experimental results of two nanoscale circuit examples demonstrate that SUS achieves significantly enhanced accuracy over other traditional techniques when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a few hundred.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001370","","Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;Random access memory;Random variables","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;SRAM chips;integrated circuit modelling;nanoelectronics;probability;statistical analysis","DFF;Markov chain Monte Carlo samples;Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation;Metropolis algorithm;SRAM;circuit failure events;conditional probabilities;failure probability;nanoscale circuit blocks;statistical analysis;statistical methodology;subset simulation technique","","1","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Towards this end, our work aims at minimizing the HEV fuel consumption over any driving cycle (without prior knowledge of the cycle) by using a reinforcement learning technique. This is in clear contrast to prior work, which requires deterministic or stochastic knowledge of the driving cycles. In addition, the proposed reinforcement learning technique enables us to (partially) avoid reliance on complex HEV modeling while coping with driver specific behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first work that applies the reinforcement learning technique to the HEV power management problem.

As one of the most promising next generation lithography (NGL) technologies, it can achieve very high resolution even for sub-10nm technology node. However, before EBL can be used for High Volume Manufacturing (HVM), its problem of low throughput has to be solved. Character Projection (CP) with a set of pre-defined characters is thought to be an essential technology for throughput improvement. With CP, a key problem is stencil planning, which is to select and place the best characters onto the stencil such that the throughput of the system can be maximized. If the overlapping between characters are awared, the throughput can be further optimized. In this paper, we investigate this 2D overlapping-aware stencil planning problem.

Today, they are architected to include multiple clock domains as a measure to reduce power consumption. Verifying them proves to be a computationally intensive and challenging task as it requires their clocks to be synchronized. To achieve synchronization, existing Boolean satisfiability-based methodologies add hardware to combine the clock domains before transforming them into their iterative logic array representation (ILA). As a consequence, this results in the addition of redundant time-frames adding overhead during verification. This paper introduces a novel framework to verify designs with multiple clocks using Quantified Boolean Formula satisfiability (QBF). We first present a formulation that models an ILA representation with symbolic universal quantification to achieve synchronization. This is later extended with the use of a clock divider to overcome inefficiencies. The net effect is the reduction in the number of redundant time-frames. Furthermore, the usage of QBF results in significant memory savings when compared to traditional methods. Experiments on bounded model checking demonstrate memory reductions of 76% on average with competitive run-time performance.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001426","","Arrays;Clocks;Frequency-domain analysis;Hardware;Memory management;Multiplexing;Synchronization","Boolean functions;clocks;computability;logic arrays;logic circuits;logic design;power consumption;synchronisation","Boolean satisfiability-based methodology;ILA;QBF-based verification environment;bounded model checking;clock divider;iterative logic array representation;multiple clock domain synchronization;power consumption reduction;quantified Boolean formula satisfiability;redundant time-frames;symbolic universal quantification","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our strategy assumes existence of an optimized exact Boolean network, which is critical in practice since arithmetic blocks are rarely synthesized from 2-level representation automatically. The goal is to produce minimum cost circuits whose logic function deviates in a controlled manner from the exact function with deviations quantified by the magnitude and frequency of errors. We rely on network simplifications allowed by external don't cares (EXDCs). We formulate the error-magnitude constrained problem by using Boolean relations to capture the allowed error behavior in a more general manner compared to incompletely specified functions. Our key contribution is in finding sets of external don't cares that maximally approach the Boolean relation. The algorithm starts with an EXDC set that is overly relaxed and iteratively, and in a greedy fashion, identifies a feasible EXDC set by solving a series of conventional EXDC-based network optimizations. The algorithm then ensures compliance to error frequency constraints by recovering the correct outputs on the sought number of error-producing inputs while aiming to minimize the network cost increase. We applied the algorithm to several well-known adder and multiplier designs of varying bit-width. Even for small error magnitudes, the algorithm produces networks with gate count reduced by 30-50%, when the error frequency constraint is loose.

State-of-the-art learning-based policies are autonomous and adaptive to the environment, but they are subject to costly computational overhead and lengthy convergence time. As smart devices are connected to Internet, this paper proposes the Learning-on-Cloud (LoC) policy to exploit cloud computing for power management. Sophisticated learning engines are offloaded from local devices to the cloud with minimal communication data, thus the runtime overhead is reduced. The learning data are shared between many devices with the same model, hence the convergence rate is raised. With one thousand devices connecting to the cloud, the LoC agent is able to converge within a few iterations; the energy saving is better than both of the greedy and the learning-based policies with less latency penalty. By implementing the LoC policy as an Android App, the measured overhead is only 0.01% of the system time.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001379","","Cloud computing;Context;Convergence;Engines;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Performance evaluation;Runtime","cloud computing;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;power aware computing;smart phones","Android app;LoC agent;cloud computing;convergence rate;energy consumption;energy saving;learning engines;learning-on-cloud power management policy;smart devices","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the fundamental tradeoffs in NoC design is the radix of its constituent routers. While high-radix routers enable a richly connected and low diameter network, low-radix routers allow for a small silicon area. Since the NoC consumes a significant portion of the on-chip resources, naïvely deploying an expensive high-radix network is not a practical option. In this work, we present a novel solution to provide high-radix like performance at a cost similar to that of a low-radix network. Our solution leverages the irregularity in runtime communication patterns to provide short low-latency paths between frequently communicating nodes, while infrequently communicating pairs rely on longer paths. To this end, it leverages a flexible topology reconfiguration infrastructure with abundantly available links between routers (in accordance to a high-radix topology) that are decoupled from scarcely available router ports (similar to a low-radix topology). Network links are bound to router ports at runtime to form connected and deadlock-free topologies. Binding selections are based on the traffic patterns observed, which are synthesized through a distributed statistics-collection framework. Our experiments on a 64-node CMP, running multiprogrammed workloads, show that we can reduce average network latency by 19% over an area- and power- comparable mesh NoC. The latency improvements for non-uniform synthetic traffic are above 30%.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001365","","Multiplexing;Network topology;Ports (Computers);Routing;Runtime;Three-dimensional displays;Topology","chemical mechanical polishing;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","CMP;NoC design;SoC designs;deadlock-free topologies;high-radix on-chip networks;low-radix routers;multicore processors;networks-on-chip","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Verifying the correctness of error detection circuits and ensuring they provide enough design coverage is a hard problem which usually involves substantial amount of manual work. This problem is even more challenging in the presence of different design methodologies, such as with the inclusion of third party IP blocks where functional descriptions of logic designs may not be available. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a completely automated RTL-based verification flow for error detection and correction circuits. Several related challenges are solved: first, that of identification of potential error detection circuits in logic designs where no functional description or methodology hints are given. Second, identification of structures of the latches that are potentially protected by such error detection circuits. Third, using formal verification for ensuring that the implemented circuits for resiliency indeed detect all single bit errors in the latches they are intended to cover. The approach is described with parity detection as an example, although it is extensible to other coding methods such as ECC and state orthogonality checking. Novel algorithms are given and results on industrial designs are presented.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001322","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit faults;Error analysis;Error correction codes;Integrated circuit modeling;Latches;Logic gates","error correction codes;error detection codes;flip-flops;formal verification;logic design;radiation hardening (electronics)","ECC;automated RTL-based verification flow;coding methods;design coverage;error correction circuits;error correction mechanisms;error detection circuits;error detection mechanism;formal verification;hard errors;latches structure identification;logic designs;parity-protected memory element automated detection;parity-protected memory element verification;single bit errors;soft errors;state orthogonality checking;technology scaling;third party IP blocks","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Designers can no longer reap the benefits in power, performance and area by simply relying on feature size miniature with contemporary design techniques. This work illustrates the importance of design and manufacturing technology co-optimization. Limitations in lithography has led to slower reduction in metal and VIA shape spacing than critical dimensions, which prompts for co-optimization in metallization stack, power mesh planning, standard cell designs and placement algorithms. New routing algorithms and parasitics modeling are required to achieve improved design performance under sky-rocketing metal resistance especially at lower metal levels. Ever-lowering maximum current limits due to EM has prompted new approaches in placement optimization to counteract the potential explosion in EM violations. Adoption of FinFET has allowed ultra-low Vdd designs, which requires careful consideration of Vth offerings that allow proper trade-off between variability, area and power efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001408","","Layout;Metals;Optimization;Pins;Resistance;Routing;Standards","MOSFET;electromigration;integrated circuit metallisation;lithography;nanotechnology;optimisation;process design;semiconductor device manufacture","EM violations;FinFET devices;design;electromigration;lithography;manufacturing process cooptimization;metallization stack;nanotechnology;parasitic modeling;power mesh planning;routing algorithms","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As transistor level, gate level and RTL methods have become well understood and widely adopted, interest has grown in power aware system design. This interest has arisen along with the overall growth and adoption of SystemC for functional modeling and simulation. In a comprehensive power aware flow, power analyses and optimizations occur during all three major design phases: System Design, RTL Design, and Implementation. These activities require models that represent the power characteristics of each design element. However, unlike RTL Design and Implementation, System Design has no standard power modeling or analysis mechanisms. This lack of abstract, system level power models inhibits system level power analysis: where models are unavailable the flow is unrealized, where models are available the accuracy and flexibility is often limited. This issue motivated the development of modeling capabilities for IP block abstract power models for use in all phases of SoC design. This development built upon existing gate level modeling semantics and flows. This presentation will begin with an overview of existing gate level power modeling capabilities, using the Liberty modeling language as the example. The interpretation of the models by power calculation applications will be described, including the interaction between power models and simulation data. Requirements beyond the existing gate level capabilities will be described. Key requirements include black-box and grey-box modeling styles, methods for handling the exponential explosion of power states and power state transitions, automatic model generation, power component categorization, and descriptions of power structure and power operation. Some of these requirements have already been implemented while others are in the proposal stage. Example usage of such a system level model will - e illustrated with a Transaction Level (TLM) Simulation. The example will illustrate how the model is used to produce dynamic and leakage power calculations from the TLM simulation data.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001333","","Abstracts;Analytical models;Data models;Logic gates;Standards;System analysis and design;System-on-chip","","","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This compaction process induces extra cycle penalty and degrades the effectiveness of compressed cache design. In this paper, we propose a compaction-free compressed cache architecture which can completely eliminate the time for executing compaction. Based on this cache design, we demonstrate that our results, compared with the conventional cache, have system performance improvement by 16% and energy reduction by 16%.

To reduce shot count of complex mask shapes, mask writers allow overlapping shots, due to which the problem of fracturing mask shapes with minimum shot count is NP-hard. The need to correct for e-beam proximity effect makes mask fracturing even more challenging. Although a number of fracturing heuristics have been proposed, there has been no systematic study to analyze the quality of their solutions. In this work, we propose a new method to generate benchmarks with known optimal solutions that can be used to evaluate the suboptimality of mask fracturing heuristics. We also propose a method to generate tight upper and lower bounds for actual ILT mask shapes by formulating mask fracturing as an integer linear program and solving it using branch and price. Our results show that a state-of-the-art prototype [version of] capability within a commercial EDA tool for e-beam mask shot decomposition can be suboptimal by as much as 3.7× for generated benchmarks, and by as much as 3.6× for actual ILT shapes.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001359","","Benchmark testing;Image segmentation;Mathematical model;Merging;Pricing;Proximity effects;Shape","computational complexity;electron beam effects;integer programming;linear programming;masks;proximity effect (lithography)","EDA tool;ILT mask;NP-hard;e-beam mask shot decomposition;e-beam proximity effect;integer linear program;inverse lithography;mask fracturing heuristics;nonrectilinear mask shapes;resolution enhancement techniques","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, global-routing-based routing congestion estimators (GRCEs) are widely used to detect the routability problems in the early VLSI design stages. To make GRCEs fast, using parallel routing approaches to speed up GRCEs is a promising direction. However, integrating existing parallel routing approaches into a GRCE may degrade the accuracy of the GRCE, because the routing kernel of the GRCE has to be modified such that its routing behavior changes. This paper presents a resource-level parallel approach (RPA) to accelerate GRCEs. RPA is easy to implement and has no need to change the routing kernels of GRCEs. Thus, GRCEs accelerated by RPA can keep its routing behavior and the estimation accuracy. Moreover, this paper presents an analytical method to quantify the estimation accuracy of a GRCE. Traditionally, the accuracy of a GRCE is manually measured by how they look like between the congestion maps generated by the GRCE and a real router, which may be inaccurate and time-consuming. In contrast, using the proposed quantifying method to evaluate the accuracy of a GRCE is more precise and faster.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001381","","Acceleration;Accuracy;Dispatching;Estimation;Measurement;Nickel;Routing","VLSI;estimation theory;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing","GRCE;RPA;VLSI design;estimation accuracy;global-routing-based routing congestion estimation;parallel routing;resource-level parallel approach;routing kernel","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is more robust for process variations and gives the chip similar physical and electrical characteristics as well as more reliable and predictable performance. Assigning the same type of pattern for the same type of cell is called a constrained pattern assignment (CPA) problem. In this paper, we integrated the flow of detailed placement and TPL decompositions with CPA coloring constraints. We focused on refining a layout to make it CPA-friendly during the detailed placement stage while minimizing the area and HPWL (half perimeter wire length) overhead. A weighted partial MAX SAT approach is proposed which guarantees to obtain a CPA-friendly detailed placement result while minimizing the area overhead. An efficient graph model is also proposed to compute the locations of the cells with optimal HPWL. Our formulation is very efficient and achieves a 79.4% area overhead reduction compared with the approach of fixing cell colors beforehand. Better HPWL are also achieved consistently over all benchmarks.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001341","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Law;Layout;Lithography;Standards","graph theory;lithography","CPA;HPWL overhead;MAX SAT approach;TPL decompositions;constrained pattern assignment;half perimeter wire length overhead;size 10 nm;size 14 nm;triple patterning lithography","","2","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of replacing each flip-flop in a power-gated circuit with a single-bit retention register (SBRR), recent research has shown that applying multi-bit retention registers (MBRRs) can effectively reduce the storage size, and hence save more chip area and leakage power. However, the previous work simply adopted greedy heuristics for power-gated circuit optimization with MBRRs, which first break feedback paths and then iteratively replace a flip-flop covering the maximum number of (k-1)-link paths with a k-bit retention register. Different from the previous work, this paper presents an even more effective approach based on integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulation with simultaneous consideration of all feedback paths. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can further reduce up to 46% storage size compared with the previous work.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001354","","Circuit optimization;Clocks;IEEE 802.16 Standards;Latches;Registers;Runtime;System-on-chip","circuit optimisation;flip-flops;integer programming;linear programming","ILP formulation;MBRR;SBRR;feedback paths;flip-flop states;greedy heuristics;integer-linear-programming formulation;k-bit retention register;multibit retention registers;power-gated circuit optimization;single-bit retention register;sleep mode","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the required level of assurance for this safety-critical application, the Automated Airspace Concept (AAC) proposes a network of components providing multiple levels of separation assurance, including conflict detection and resolution. In our previous work, we conducted a formal study of this concept including specification, validation, and verification utilizing the NuSMV and CadenceSMV model checkers to ensure there are no potentially catastrophic design flaws remaining in the AAC design before the next stage of production. In this paper, we extend that work to include probabilistic model checking of the AAC system.<sup>1</sup> We are motivated by the system designers requirement to compare different design options to optimize the functional allocation of the AAC components. Probabilistic model checking provides quantitative measures for evaluating different design options, helping system designers to understand the impact of parameters in the model on a given critical safety requirement. We detail our approach to modeling and probabilistically analyzing this complex system consisting of a real-time algorithm, a logic protocol, and human factors. We utilize both Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) and Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) models to capture the important behaviors in the AAC components. The separation assurance algorithms, which are defined over specific time ranges, are modeled using a DTMC. The emergence of conflicts in an airspace sector and the reaction times of pilots, which can be simplified as Markov processes on continuous time, are modeled as a CTMC. Utilizing these two models, we calculate the probability of an unresolved conflict as a measure of safety and compare multiple design options.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001427","","Aircraft;Analytical models;Atmospheric modeling;Model checking;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Safety","Markov processes;aerospace computing;air safety;air traffic control;continuous time systems;discrete time systems;formal verification;probability","AAC component;AAC design;AAC system;CTMC model;CadenceSMV model checker;DTMC;Markov process;NuSMV;airspace sector;automated air traffic control systems;automated airspace concept;catastrophic design flaw;comparative analysis;conflict detection and resolution;continuous time Markov chain model;critical safety requirement;design option;discrete time Markov chain;functional allocation;human factor;logic protocol;probabilistic model checking;probability;real-time algorithm;safety-critical application;separation assurance algorithm;system designer","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nearly all existing PUF systems to date need a mechanism to deal with “bit flips” when exact regeneration of the bitstring is required, e.g., for cryptographic applications. Error correction (ECC) and error avoidance schemes have been proposed but both of these require helper data to be stored for the regeneration process. Unfortunately, helper data adds time and area overhead to the PUF system and provides opportunities for adversaries to reverse engineer the secret bitstring. In this paper, we propose a non-volatile memory-based (NVM) PUF that is able to avoid bit flips without requiring any type of helper data. A voltage-to-digital converter technique is described for digitizing the analog entropy source and a robust median-finding algorithm is proposed as the reprograming strategy. Analysis on published experimental data is presented to demonstrate the practicability of our proposed strategy. We describe the technique in the context of emerging nano-devices, in particular, resistive random access memory (Memristor) cells, but the methodology is applicable to any type of NVM including Flash.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001345","Helper data;Memristor;Physically Unclonable Functions","Entropy;Histograms;Memristors;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Reliability;Resistance","analogue-digital conversion;circuit stability;cryptography;error correction;random-access storage","ECC;NVM;PUF systems;analog entropy source;area overhead;bit flips;bitstring exact regeneration;cryptography;environmental variations;error avoidance schemes;error correction schemes;memristor cells;nano-devices;nonvolatile memory based physically unclonable function;reprograming strategy;resistive random access memory;robust median-finding algorithm;stability;time overhead;voltage-to-digital converter technique","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The continuous streams of richly annotated sensory data on these IoT devices have also enabled the emergence of a new class of context-aware apps that use the data to infer user context and accordingly customize their responses in real-time. However, this growth in the number of apps has not been complemented with adequate system support on the IoT devices resulting in monolithic apps that each implement and execute their own customized sensing pipelines. In this paper, we outline our vision of a sensing stack, akin to a networking stack, that can facilitate the development and execution of context-aware apps on IoT devices. There are several advantages to building a rich sensing stack. First, it allows apps to reuse stages of the sensing pipeline easing their development. Second, the layers of the stack allow for both in- and cross-layer resource optimization. Finally, it allows better control over the shared data as instead of raw-sensor data, higher-level semantic abstractions, such as inferences can now be shared with apps.

As such, the threshold voltage for noise sensors to report emergencies serves as a critical tuning knob between the system failure rate and the runtime performance loss (RPL) due to false alarms. Unfortunately, the problem of optimal threshold voltage computation remains open in literature despite its importance. The problem is further complicated by process variations, which introduce significant variations in load currents and thus in noise across different chips. A uniform noise margin may not work optimally for all the chips. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of minimizing the system failure rate subject to a given RPL constraint. We then put forward a uniform scheme to find an optimal solution for all chips. Compared to a seemingly more intuitive approach which is too conservative, experimental results over a set of industrial designs show an average of 32.1% reduction in system failure rate under the same RPL constraint. We further show that with the help of I<sub>ddq</sub> measurements during testing which reveals process variation information, it is possible and efficient to compute a per-chip optimal threshold voltage. Such an approach further reduces the system failure rate by 25.0% on average compared with the uniform threshold approach, under the same RPL constraint. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on optimal threshold voltage computation for noise sensors. We hope that it shall point out new directions for systematic studies of on-chip noise sensor utilization.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001353","","Noise;Semiconductor device measurement;Sensor systems;System-on-chip;Testing;Threshold voltage","electric noise measurement;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit testing","on-chip noise sensors;runtime noise management systems;runtime performance loss;variation aware optimal threshold voltage computation","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consistency-based fault diagnosis aims at identifying fault candidates for an erroneous execution trace by symbolically checking the consistency between the golden gate-level model and the faulty behavior of the prototype chip. The scalability of this technique is limited to short executions due to the underlying decision procedure. This problem has previously been addressed by restricting the analysis to a window of fixed size and moving it along the execution trace. In this setting, limited observability results in a loss of precision and potentially missed fault candidates. We present a novel interpolation-based framework which formalizes the propagation of state information across sliding windows as a satisfiability problem. Our approach provides both spatial and temporal localization for general faults and is not restricted to a specific fault model. Further, our approach can be used to provide more accurate localization for a single permanent fault model.

Trial-n-Error is a systematic approach that employs our proposed Synergy Testing to capture the refresh bottleneck of DRAM memory: “weak” cells that have a relatively shorter retention time. By locating the dominant weak cells sensitized by applications, Trial-n-Error can avoid the worst-case refresh setting, and adjust the refresh rate under the control of our self-tuning algorithm. Thus, Trial-n-Error can gradually approach to the possible lower-bound of refresh rate for less energy and memory bandwidth consumption.

The majority of methods for doing this verification have focused on strong semantic models for reasoning about systems and their specifications, but these models can add significant unnecessary complexity.

Load balancing in power distribution systems is an essential technique for smart grid that enables reliable electricity delivery to end customers. This paper is the first work focusing on load balancing using switch reconfiguration, tie-line addition, and wire upgrade simultaneously, while existing works adopt only one of the three techniques to configure the power distribution system. We observe that the new load balancing problem induces a new challenge, dynamic topology rotation, which cannot be handled by existing solutions. To overcome this challenge, we first consider bidirectional power flows and formulate the load balancing problem as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). To reduce the computational complexity, it is further transformed into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) without loss of optimality. Experimental results show that, on real power distribution networks, our approach produces optimal solutions that are unlikely to be found in ad-hoc heuristics methods.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001380","Smart grid;distribution radial network;integer linear programming;load balancing;minimum spanning trees;switch configuration;tie-line addition;wire upgrade","Load flow;Load management;Substations;Switches;Topology;Wires","heuristic programming;integer programming;linear programming;load flow;power consumption;power distribution economics;power distribution reliability;quadratic programming;smart power grids","MILP;MIQCQP;ad hoc heuristic method;bidirectional power flow;computational complexity reduction;dynamic topology rotation;economical way;electricity delivery reliability;mixed integer linear program;mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic program;power distribution dynamic system configuration;power distribution network;smart grid load balancing technique;switch reconfiguration;tie-line reconfiguration;volatile consumption demand;wire upgrade reconfiguration","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Security-aware mapping for TDMA-based real-time distributed systems","Chung-Wei Lin; Qi Zhu; Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.","Univ. of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","24","31","Cyber-security has become a critical issue for realtime distributed embedded systems in domains such as automotive, avionics, and industrial automation. However, in many of such systems, tight resource constraints and strict timing requirements make it difficult or even impossible to add security mechanisms after the initial design stages. To produce secure and safe systems with desired performance, security must be considered together with other objectives at the system level and from the beginning of the design. In this paper, we focus on security-aware design for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based real-time distributed systems. The TDMA-based protocol we consider is an abstraction of many time-triggered protocols that are being adopted in various safety-critical systems for their more predictable timing behavior, such as FlexRay, Time-Triggered Protocol, and Time-Triggered Ethernet. To protect against attacks on TDMA-based real-time distributed systems, we apply a message authentication mechanism with time-delayed release of keys, which provides a good balance between security and computational overhead but needs sophisticated network scheduling to ensure that the increased latencies due to delayed key releases will not violate timing requirements. We propose formulations and an algorithm to optimize the task allocation, priority assignment, network scheduling, and key-release interval length during the mapping process, while meeting both security and timing requirements. Experimental results of an automotive case study and a synthetic example show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001325","","Delays;Protocols;Real-time systems;Receivers;Resource management;Security","embedded systems;local area networks;message authentication;protocols;real-time systems;resource allocation;safety-critical software;scheduling;telecommunication security;time division multiple access","FlexRay;TDMA based real-time distributed system;TDMA-based protocol;TDMA-based real-time distributed systems;automotive case study;cyber-security;delayed key release;key-release interval length;mapping process;message authentication mechanism;network scheduling;priority assignment;realtime distributed embedded system;resource constraint;safety-critical system;security mechanism;security-aware design;security-aware mapping;task allocation;time division multiple access;time-delayed release of key;time-triggered Ethernet;time-triggered protocol;timing requirement","","1","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Modeling and analysis of nonstationary low-frequency noise in circuit simulators: Enabling non Monte Carlo techniques","Mahmutoglu, A.G.; Demir, A.","Koc Univ., Istanbul, Turkey","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","309","315","Modeling and analysis of low frequency noise in circuit simulators with time-varying bias conditions is a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we offer a definite solution for this problem and present a model for low-frequency noise that captures the internal, stochastic dynamics of the individual noise sources via dedicated internal pseudo nodes that are coupled with the rest of the circuit. Our method correctly incorporates the inherent nonstationarity of low-frequency noise into the device model and the circuit simulator. It is based on a probabilistic description of oxide traps in nano-scale devices that individually cause the so-called random telegraph signal (RTS) noise, and, en masse, are believed to be the culprits of other low-frequency noise phenomena, such as 1/f and burst noise. Our model captures the dependence of noise characteristics on the state variables of the circuit. Its simple yet precise mathematical formulation allows the utilization of well-established, non Monte Carlo techniques for nonstationary noise analysis. In one embodiment that we present in this paper, the proposed noise model is used to perform frequency-domain, non Monte Carlo, semi-analytical noise evaluation for circuits under periodic large-signal excitations. For this case, we verify that the computed noise spectral densities match the ones obtained via spectral estimation from timedomain Monte Carlo noise simulation data.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001368","RTS noise;low frequency noise;noise analysis;nonstationary noise","Computational modeling;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Monte Carlo methods;Noise;Stochastic processes","Monte Carlo methods;circuit noise;circuit simulation;frequency-domain analysis;network analysis;time-domain analysis","circuit simulators;device model;low-frequency noise;nano-scale devices;non Monte Carlo techniques;nonstationary noise analysis;oxide traps;probabilistic description;random telegraph signal noise;semi-analytical noise evaluation;spectral estimation;time-domain Monte Carlo noise simulation data","","2","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A hardware accelerated multilevel visual classifier for embedded visual-assist systems","Cotter, M.; Advani, S.; Sampson, J.; Irick, K.; Narayanan, V.","","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20150108","2014","","","96","100","Embedded visual assist systems are emerging as increasingly viable tools for aiding visually impaired persons in their day-to-day life activities. Novel wearable devices with imaging capabilities will be uniquely positioned to assist visually impaired in activities such as grocery shopping. However, supporting such time-sensitive applications on embedded platforms requires an intelligent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. In order to maximize their utility in real-world scenarios, visual classifiers often need to recognize objects within large sets of object classes that are both diverse and deep. In a grocery market, simultaneously recognizing the appearance of people, shopping carts, and pasta is an example of a common diverse object classification task. Moreover, a useful visual-aid system would need deep classification capability to distinguish among the many styles and brands of pasta to direct attention to a particular box. Exemplar Support Vector Machines (ESVMs) provide a means of achieving this specificity, but are resource intensive as computation increases rapidly with the number of classes to be recognized. To maintain scalability without sacrificing accuracy, we examine the use of a biologically-inspired classifier (HMAX) as a front-end filter that can narrow the set of ESVMs to be evaluated. We show that a hierarchical classifier combining HMAX and ESVM performs better than either of the two individually. We achieve 12% improvement in accuracy over HMAX and 4% improvement over ESVM while reducing computational overhead of evaluating all possible exemplars.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001338","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Training;Visualization","image classification;image filtering;marketing;object recognition;support vector machines","ESVM;HMAX;biologically-inspired classifier;embedded visual-assist systems;exemplar support vector machines;grocery market;multilevel filtering;multilevel visual classifier;object classification","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new approach is based on a recently proposed physics-based electromigration (EM) model for more accurate EM assessment of a power grid network at the chip level. We apply the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) (by selecting the performance states or p-states of the tasks to manage the power) and thus the lifetime of the processor running different tasks over their periods. We consider both single-rate and multi-rate embedded systems with preemption. To model the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of a task for a given p-state, response surface modeling is applied. We then frame the reliability optimization problem as the continuous constrained nonlinear optimization problem in which the system EM-induced reliability is maximized subject to the timing constraints, which is further solved by simulated annealing method. Experimental results show that for low utilization systems, significant reliability improvement can be achieved with even smaller power consumption than existing reliability-ignore scheduling method. The proposed method can lead to near Pareto's front trade-off between the power/energy and the lifetime compared to the existing task scheduling method.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001388","","Embedded systems;Optimization;Program processors;Real-time systems;Reliability;Stress;Wires","electromigration;microprocessor chips;nonlinear programming;real-time systems;response surface methodology;simulated annealing","DVFS;EM assessment;MTTF;Pareto's front trade-off;chip level;continuous constrained nonlinear optimization problem;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;electromigration-induced reliability;lifetime task optimization technique;mean-time-to-failure;multi-rate embedded systems;physics-based electromigration model;power grid network;real-time embedded processors;reliability optimization problem;response surface modeling;simulated annealing method;single-rate embedded systems;system EM-induced reliability;timing constraints","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we introduce in this paper UI-Timer, a powerful CNPR algorithm which achieves exact accuracy and ultra-fast runtime. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, UI-Timer proves that by implicit path representation the amount of search effort can be significantly reduced. Our timer is superior in both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search.

This paper presents BIST-PUF, the first built-in-self-test (BIST) methodology for online evaluation of weak and strong PUFs. BIST-PUF provides a paradigm shift in the evaluation of the un-clonable circuit identifiers: unlike earlier known PUF evaluation suites that are software-based and offline, BIST-PUF enables on-the-fly assessment of the desired PUF properties all in hardware. More specifically, the BIST-PUF structure is designed to evaluate two main properties of PUFs, namely unpredictability and stability. These properties are important for ensuring robustness and security in face of operational, structural, and environmental fluctuations due to variations, aging or adversarial acts. For BIST-PUF unpredictability evaluation, we identify and adopt the tests of randomness that are amenable to hardware implementation. For stability assessment, the BIST-PUF suggests three distinct methods, namely, sensor-based, parametric interrogation, and multiple interrogations.

It is also known that the optimal power control strategy depends on the process conditions corresponding to the RF devices concerned. This complicates the problem of designing the feedback control system that guarantees the best control strategy for minimizing power consumption across all channel conditions and process corners. Since this problem is largely intractable due to the complexity of simulation across all channel conditions and process corners, we propose a self-learning strategy for adaptive MIMO-RF systems. In this approach, RF devices learn their own performance vs. power consumption vs. tuning knob relationships ""on-the-fly"" and formulate the optimum reconfiguration strategy using neural-network based learning techniques during real-time operation.

Among them, due to the potential to fundamentally alter everyday life as well as how science and engineering systems are designed and operated, the Internet of Things (IoT) stands out. IoT also poses an extraordinary system replete with conceptual and technical challenges. For instance, greatly reduced quantitative bounds on acceptable area and energy metrics require qualitative breakthroughs in design and optimization techniques. Most likely the most demanding of requirements for the widespread realization of many IoT visions is security. IoT security has an exceptionally wide scope in at least four dimensions. In terms of security scope it includes rarely addressed tasks such as trusted sensing, computation, communication, privacy, and digital forgetting. It also asks for new and better techniques for the protection of hardware, software, and data that considers the possibility of physical access to IoT devices. Sensors and actuators are common components of IoT devices and pose several unique security challenges including the integrity of physical signals and actuating events. Finally, during processing of collected data, one can envision many semantic attacks. Our strategic objective is to provide an impetus for the development of IoT CAD security techniques. We start by presenting a brief survey of IoT challenges and opportunities with an emphasis on security issues. Next, we discuss the potential of hardware-based IoT security approaches.

The proposed new asynchronous design method is compatible with conventional synthesis, placement and routing (PnR) and other computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Only a conventional standard cell library is used. Compared to traditional synchronous static CMOS design, the proposed design is highly suitable for very low voltage operation. An auto-sleep strategy is also integrated in the tool for minimizing the leakage power for circuits. Different benchmark circuits were implemented in IBM 130nm technology to show that the design approach used in TonyChopper is highly robust even in the sub-threshold regime. The layout for every benchmark circuit was generated using a Cadence PnR tool. Hspice simulation for both the synchronous benchmark circuit and the desynchronized version provided comparison of the delay, area and leakage power for each benchmark circuit.

Smaller transistor and hence thinner gate oxide implies transistors are more vulnerable against an Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) event. Among the test models in ESD, Charged Device Model (CDM) has greater potential to cause catastrophic damage to the device due to its faster and larger discharging current. To protect against a CDM event, power clamps are placed across the design to offer a low resistance discharge path. However, conventional power clamp placement method to place power clamps generally relies on design experience. In this work, we propose a power clamp placement algorithm that places power clamp at strategic location which can effectively minimize number of power clamps while achieving better protection against a CDM event compared to conventional approach.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001423","","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitors;Clamps;Discharges (electric);Electrostatic discharges;Pins;Stress","clamps;electrostatic discharge;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit technology","CDM protection;ESD event;charged device model;device reliability;electrostatic discharge;gate oxide;low resistance discharge path;power clamp placement algorithm;power density","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To counter direct attacks and lower the exposure of unlocked circuits to the foundry, we introduce a multiplexor-based locking strategy that preserves test response allowing IC testing by an untrusted party before activation.

Our studies first show that the full PDN worsens routing congestion more severely in monolithic 3D ICs than in 2D designs due to the significant reduction in resources for 3D connections. The increase in signal wirelength translates into additional net switching power dissipation, which significantly contributes to total power. This in turn aggravates thermal issues in 3D ICs. In addition, we observe that PDN tradeoffs among wirelength, power, and thermal are more pronounced in monolithic 3D ICs than TSV-based 3D and 2D designs. This is because of the higher integration density and the severe competition between signal and power connections. Lastly, we develop various PDN design optimization techniques for monolithic 3D ICs and obtain up to 8% signal wirelength and 5% maximum temperature reduction under the given IR drop budget.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001406","","Conductivity;Integrated circuits;Metals;Power dissipation;Routing;Three-dimensional displays;Wires","integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;optimisation;three-dimensional integrated circuits","PDN;full-chip wirelength;monolithic 3D IC;power delivery network designs;power effects;routing congestion;switching power dissipation;thermal effects","","1","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, the steep subthreshold swing of the devices obviates the output transfer hardware used in a conventional CNN cell. For image processing with binary stable outputs, Tunnelling FETs (TFETs) can facilitate low power operation. For multi-valued problems, devices like graphene transistors, Symmetric tunnelling FETs (SymFETs) might be leveraged to solve a problem with fewer computational steps. The potential for additional hardware reduction when compared to functional equivalents via conventional CNNs is also possible. Emerging devices can also lead to lower power implementations of the voltage controlled current sources (VCCSs) that are an integral component of any CNN cell. Furthermore, non-linear implementations of the VCCSs via emerging devices could enable simpler computational paths for many image processing tasks.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001337","","CMOS integrated circuits;Cellular neural networks;Computer architecture;Graphene;Image processing;Microprocessors;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;cellular neural nets;field effect transistors;graphene;image processing;low-power electronics;tunnel transistors","CMOS based von Neumann architectures;CNNs;SymFETs;TFETs;VCCSs;beyond-CMOS emerging devices;cellular neural networks;graphene transistors;image analysis;image processing applications;multivalued problems;nonvon Neumann computing paradigm;steep slope devices;symmetric tunnelling FETs;voltage controlled current sources","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously proposed solutions for this design step suffer from two issues: They are mainly of heuristic nature and usually assume that the blockages to be bypassed are present the entire time. In contrast, we present a methodology which exploits the fact that blockages are often only present at certain intervals. At the same time, our approach guarantees exact solutions, i.e. always determines a routing with a minimal number of time steps.

Currently the way in which thermal maps are obtained by infrared thermographer yields inaccurate results since the emissivity values of all elements in an IC are ignored and measurement method assumes a constant emissivity. Without the correct settings of emissivity in infrared thermographer, the temperature variation could reach up to as high as 300 %. Coating black paint on the IC surface is a widely used method to assume the IC with constant emissivity and simplify the measurement procedures. Coating a uniform black thin film on an IC is a highly skillful technique and the coated black paint is un-removable. In certain cases, it is not convenient or possible to do so - for example, as monitoring a working chip. This article proposes the first practical and feasible method for emissivity map measurement. Two reference plates are utilized to obtain an emissivity map, from which real emissivity value of each pixel of the infrared thermographer is obtained. Firstly the radiances of IC and two reference plates are measured by the infrared thermographer. After that, the emissivity map of the IC can be calculated by the radiances. According to the experimental results herein, the uncertainty in the emissivity measured using this method is very low, of the order of 0.01, consistent with the minimum resolution of all currently available infrared thermographic instruments. With the emissivity map, the high accuracy temperature map is then obtained. The comparison of the temperature maps simulated by the extend version of Noxim (Access Noxim) as well as measured by the thermographer with constant emissivity and with the accurate emissivity map are presented in this article. This work contributes to the field of thermal analysis and simulation. Accurate circuit characteristics can be obtained through accurate thermal map; on the other h- nd, the closeness between the thermal simulation result and the real thermal map can also be realized.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001403","emissivity;infrared thermographer;radiance;temperature map","Coatings;Integrated circuits;Materials;Surface treatment;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement;Wavelength measurement","infrared imaging;integrated circuit packaging;spectral methods of temperature measurement;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging)","Access Noxim;absolute temperature map measurement;accurate thermal map;circuit characteristics;emissivity map measurement;emissivity measurement uncertainty;infrared thermographer;integrated circuits;reference plates;temperature correlation;thermal analysis;thermal simulation","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate the checkpoint overhead, we propose a fast local checkpointing scheme by leveraging Multi-Level Cell (MLC) STT-RAM. We take advantage of the unique features of MLC STT-RAM to accelerate local checkpointing.

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 14 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, while 2013 CAD contest attracted 87 teams from 9 regions. Continuing its great success in 2012 and 2013, 2014 CAD contest attracts 93 teams from 9 regions, including Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, US, Canada, Brazil, and Russian Federation. Three contest problems on verification, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Chih-Jen Hsu of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on efficiently solving the combinational single-output netlists. The efficiency of solving a single-output function highly depends on the CNF encoding and the SAT solving. For the first problem, contestants are required to explore the best CNF encoding and SAT solver setting to solve the most tests within the shortest runtime. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on incremental timing-driven placement. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total slack and worst slack are optimized. Topic chair Rasit O. Topaloglu of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. In a circuit layout, densities of polygons within windows of interest may have a large v- riation across such windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, fills are inserted to make the density of several windows uniform. For the third problem, contestants are required to minimize the density variation with least fills. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001374","Verification;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Educational institutions;Encoding;Force;Integrated circuits;Optimization","","","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
