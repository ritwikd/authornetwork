The method extracts and uses a highly accurate oscillator phase macromodel termed the TP-PPV macromodel. The core idea behind the novel extraction procedure is to combine concepts from strongly nonlinear trajectory piecewise macromodeling techniques together with PPV-based time shifted nonlinear phase macromodels. As a result, TP-PPV generated macromodels offer excellent global as well as local fidelity. These properties are necessary for handing large excursions in PLL control voltages during capture/lock in, e.g., hopping frequency synthesizers. We validate TP-PPV on a 5-stage interpolative ring VCO based PLL and compare results against full simulation, as well as against prior macromodels. We show that, unlike prior macromodels that only work well when the control voltage of the VCO has small excursions, the TP-PPV macromodel provides near-perfect matches against full SPICE level simulation over a wide range of design scenarios, while achieving speedups of about three orders of magnitude","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110185","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Frequency synthesizers;Jitter;Nonlinear equations;Permission;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Voltage control;Voltage-controlled oscillators","phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","PLL macromodel;piecewise nonlinear macromodel;time-shifted oscillator macromodel","","5","1","16","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Savings of dynamic energy can be obtained by accessing frequently used data from smaller memories rather than from large background memories. The optimization of the hierarchical memory architecture implies the addition of layers of smaller memories to which heavily used data can be copied. This paper presents a formal model for data reuse analysis which identifies those parts of arrays more intensely accessed, taking also into account the relative lifetimes of the signals.

After technology mapping, an area-prediction cost function is used to guide the selection of logic cones to be placed in embedded memories. Extra logic is added to compensate for missing asynchronous functionality on the synchronous memories.

Molecular surfaces are typically smooth, without the corners common in electrical interconnect problems, and are candidates for methods with higher order convergence than that of the commonly used flat panel methods. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a spectrally accurate approach for analyzing molecular surfaces described by a collection of surface points. The method is a synthesis of several techniques, and starts by using least squares to fit a high order spherical harmonic surface representation to the given points. Then this analytic representation is used to construct a differentiable map from the molecular surface to a cube, an orthogonal basis is generated on the rectangular cube surfaces, and a change of variables is used to desingularize the required integrals of products of basis functions and Green's function. Finally, an efficient method for solving the discretized system using a matrix-implicit scheme is described. The combined method is demonstrated on an analytically solvable sphere problem, capacitance calculation of complicated molecular surface, and a coupled Poisson/Poisson-Boltzmann problem associated with a biomolecule. The results demonstrate that for a tolerance of 10<sup>-</sup> this new approach requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer unknowns than a flat panel method","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110143","","Analytical models;Carbon nanotubes;Convergence;Electrons;Electrostatic analysis;Integral equations;Least squares methods;Molecular biophysics;Nanotechnology;Surface fitting","Green's function methods;chemistry computing;electrostatics;integral equations;matrix algebra","Green's function;Poisson/Poisson-Boltzmann problem;analytic representation;basis function;biomolecule;capacitance calculation;differentiable map;discretized system;electrostatic analysis;integral equation solver;least squares;matrix-implicit scheme;molecular surface analysis;molecular surface electrostatics;orthogonal basis;rectangular cube surface;sphere problem;spherical harmonic surface representation;surface points","","0","","46","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","143","150","Enumeration of bounded size cuts is an important step in several logic synthesis algorithms such as technology mapping and re-writing. The standard algorithm does not scale beyond 6 or 7 inputs because it enumerates all cuts and there are too many of them. We address the enumeration problem by introducing the notion of cut factorization. In cut factorization, one enumerates global and local cuts (collectively called the factor cuts) of the network, and uses these to generate other cuts. Depending on how global and local cuts are defined, one obtains different factorization schemes. In the first scheme, complete factorization, it is possible to generate any cut from factor cuts. However, complete factorization is expensive though less expensive than exhaustive enumeration. In the second scheme, partial factorization, there is no guarantee of generating all cuts from factor cuts. However, it is much faster, and produces good results. In this paper we also present two applications of factor cuts: LUT mapping and macrocell mapping. In LUT mapping, we find that considering only factor cuts guarantees depth optimality for most nodes in the network. For the remaining nodes, other cuts need to be generated from factor cuts and examined. In macrocell mapping, we focus on a particular 9-input macrocell, and use factor cuts as a heuristic method to improve depth by reducing structural bias. Factor cuts are used to map the macrocell as a whole whenever possible instead of mapping its parts separately. In this context factor cuts enable a new quality-run-time tradeoff between mapping parts of the macrocell separately (poor quality), and mapping using all 9-input cuts (long run-time)","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110166","","Circuit synthesis;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic;Macrocell networks;Network servers;Permission;Runtime;Table lookup","logic design;matrix decomposition;network synthesis","LUT mapping;bounded size cuts;cut factorization;factor cuts;global cuts;local cuts;logic synthesis;macrocell mapping","","8","","11","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advent of platform FPGAs has further exacerbated the problems by increasing the power density variations on the FPGA fabric. Therefore, we need to characterize the die temperature of platform FPGAs. In this paper, we first estimate the temperature distribution within a Virtex-4 FPGA by feeding the block power numbers in an architecture-level temperature simulator calibrated to reflect a real FPGA package. We analyze the impact of different hard-wired blocks on the temperature profile, and observe that they introduce intra-die variation in temperature of up to 20degC. Next, we evaluate the influence of placement on temperature. Our experiments indicate a decrease in peak temperature by changing the placement of hard blocks, especially the high-speed transceivers. We further propose an iterative placement technique to reduce the peak temperature, and apply it on real designs.

Energy-aware processors can be run in different speed levels; components like memory and I/O subsystems and network interface cards can be in a standby state when they are active but idle. Processor energy optimization solutions are not necessarily efficient from the perspective of systems. Current system-wide energy optimization studies are often limited to periodic tasks with heuristics in getting approximated solutions. In this paper, we develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm for periodic tasks on processors with practical discrete speed levels. The algorithm determines the lower bound of energy expenditure in pseudo-polynomial time. An approximation algorithm is proposed to provide performance guarantee with a given bound in polynomial running time. Because of their time efficiency, both the optimization and approximation algorithms can be adapted for online scheduling of sporadic tasks with irregular task releases.

Even for the approaches considering inductance effects, their delay models are too simplistic to catch the actual performance. As delay-length dependence is approaching linear with inductance effect (Ismail and Friedman, 1999), fewer buffers are needed to reduce RLC delay. This motivates this work to propose a new algorithm for RLC buffer insertion. In this paper, a new buffer insertion algorithm considering inductance for intermediate and global interconnect is proposed, based on downstream impedance instead of traditional downstream capacitance. A new pruning technique that provides tremendous speedup and a new frequency estimation method that is very accurate in delay computation are also proposed. Experiments on industrial netlists demonstrate that our new algorithm reduces the number of buffers up to 34.4% over the traditional van Ginneken's algorithm that ignores inductance. Our impedance delay estimation is very accurate compared to SPICE simulations, with only 10% error while the delay model used in the previous RLC algorithm has 20% error (Ismael et al., 2001). The accurate delay model not only reduces the number of buffers, but also brings high fidelity to the buffer solutions.

The variations of critical dimensions in modern VLSI technologies lead to variability in interconnect performance that must be fully accounted for in timing verification. However, handling a multitude of inter-die/intra-die variations and assessing their impacts on circuit performance can dramatically complicate the timing analysis. In this paper, a practical interconnect delay and slew analysis technique is presented to facilitate efficient evaluation of wire performance variability. By harnessing a collection of computationally efficient procedures and closed-form formulas, process and input signal variations are directly mapped into the variability of the output delay and slew. Since our approach produces delay and slew expressions parameterized in the underlying process variations, it can be harnessed to enable statistical timing analysis while considering important statistical correlations.

If the rate of data production is faster than the rate of consumption, the resulting design performs slower than when the communication rate is matched. This can be remedied by inserting pipeline buffers (to temporarily hold data), allowing the producer to proceed if the consumer is not ready to accept data. The problem of deciding which channels need these buffers (and how many) for an arbitrary communication profile is called the slack matching problem; the optimal solution to this problem has been shown to be NP-complete. In this paper, we present a heuristic that uses knowledge of the communication protocol to explicitly model these bottlenecks, and an iterative algorithm to progressively remove these bottlenecks by inserting buffers. We apply this algorithm to asynchronous circuits, and show that it naturally handles large designs with arbitrarily cyclic and acyclic topologies, which exhibit various types of control choice. The heuristic is efficient, achieving linear time complexity in practice, and produces solutions that (a) achieve up to 60% performance speedup on large media processing kernels, and (b) can either be verified to be optimal, or the approximation margin can be bounded","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110258","","Algorithm design and analysis;Asynchronous circuits;Circuit topology;Communication system control;Delay;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Pipelines;Production;Protocols","asynchronous circuits;buffer storage;computational complexity;pipeline processing;protocols","NP-complete problem;arbitrarily acyclic topology;arbitrarily cyclic topology;arbitrary communication;asynchronous circuits;communication protocol;data production;linear time complexity;pipeline buffers;pipelined circuits;protocol knowledge;slack matching problem","","10","","13","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The additional force which distributes the modules on the chip in force-directed quadratic placement is separated into two forces: hold force and move force. Both of these forces are determined without any heuristics. Based on this novel systematic force implementation, we show that our iterative placement algorithm converges to an overlap-free placement. In addition, engineering change order (ECO) is efficiently supported by our placer. To handle the important trade-off between CPU time and placement quality, a deterministic quality control is presented. In addition, a new linear net model is proposed, which accurately models the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) in the quadratic cost function of quadratic placement. HPWL in general is a linear metric for netlength and represents an efficient and common estimation for routed wirelength. Compared with the classical clique net model, our linear net model reduces memory usage by 75%, CPU time by 23% and netlength by 8%, which is measured by the HPWL of all nets. Using the ISPD-2005 benchmark suite for comparison, our placer combined with the new linear net model has just 5.9% higher netlength but is 16times faster than APlace, which offers the best netlength in this benchmark.

Since NBTI is strongly dependent on the time for which the PMOS device is stressed, different gates in a combinational circuit experience varying extents of delay degradation. This has necessitated a mechanism of quantizing the gate-delay degradation, to pave the way for improved design strategies. Our work addresses this issue by providing a procedure for determining the amount of delay degradation of a circuit due to NBTI. An analytical model for NBTI is derived using the framework of the reaction-diffusion model, and a mathematical proof for the widely observed phenomenon of frequency independence is provided. Simulations on ISCAS benchmarks under a 70nm technology show that NBTI causes a delay degradation of about 8% in combinational logic based circuits after 10 years (ap 3 times 108s)","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110220","","Analytical models;Combinational circuits;Degradation;Delay;Digital circuits;MOS devices;MOSFETs;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Titanium compounds","MOSFET;combinational circuits;digital circuits;integrated circuit design;logic gates;reaction-diffusion systems","PMOS transistors;combinational circuit;digital circuit design;frequency independence;gate-delay degradation;guard banding;negative bias temperature instability;reaction-diffusion model","","62","1","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the popular energy management technique dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been shown to have direct and negative effects on reliability. In this work, for a set of real-time tasks, we focus on the slack allocation problem to minimize their energy consumption while preserving the overall system reliability. Building on our previous findings for a single real-time application where a recovery task was used to preserve reliability, we identify the problem of reliability-aware energy management for multiple tasks as NP-hard and propose two polynomial-time heuristic schemes. We also investigate the effects of on-chip/off-chip workload decomposition on energy management, by considering a generalized power model.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","661","668","Shallow trench isolation (STI) is the mainstream CMOS isolation technology. It uses chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove excess of deposited oxide and attain a planar surface for successive process steps. Despite advances in STI CMP technology, pattern dependencies cause large post-CMP topography variation that can result in functional and parametric yield loss. Fill insertion is used to reduce pattern variation and consequently decrease post-CMP topography variation. Traditional fill insertion is rule-based and is used with reverse etchback to attain desired planarization quality. Due to extra costs associated with reverse etchback, ""single-step"" STI CMP in which fill insertion suffices is desirable. To alleviate the failures caused by imperfect CMP, we focus on two objectives for fill insertion: oxide density variation minimization and nitride density maximization. A linear programming based optimization is used to calculate oxide densities that minimize oxide density variation. Next a fill insertion methodology is presented that attains the calculated oxide density while maximizing the nitride density. Averaged over the two large testcases, the oxide density variation is reduced by 63% and minimum nitride density increased by 79% compared to tiling-based fill insertion. To assess post-CMP planarization, we run CMP simulation on the layout filled with our approach and find the planarization window (time window in which polishing can be stopped) to increase by 17% and maximum final step height (maximum difference in post-CMP oxide thickness) to decrease by 9%","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110249","","CMOS technology;Chemical processes;Chemical technology;Costs;Etching;Isolation technology;Linear programming;Planarization;Surface topography;Testing","CMOS integrated circuits;chemical mechanical polishing;linear programming","CMOS isolation technology;chemical mechanical polishing;linear programming;nitride density maximization;optimization;oxide density variation minimization;oxide deposit removal;parametric yield loss;pattern variation;planarization quality;post-CMP topography variation;reverse etchback;shallow trench isolation;single-step STI CMP;tiling-based fill insertion","","5","6","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We develop a new, faster method that generates and weaves together a larger set of smaller localized linearizations for the trajectory samples.

To assess performance variability, complex simulation and performance models parameterized in a high-dimensional process variation space are desired. However, the high parameter dimensionality, imposed by a large number of variation sources encountered in modern technologies, can introduce significant complexion in circuit analysis and may even render performance variability analysis completely intractable. We address the challenge brought by high-dimensional process variations via a new performance-oriented parameter dimension reduction technique. The basic premise behind our approach is that the dimensionality of performance variability is determined not only by the statistical characteristics of the underlying process variables, but also by the structural information imposed by a given design. Using the powerful reduced rank regression (RRR) and its extension as a vehicle for variability modeling, we are able to systematically identify statistically significant reduced parameter sets and compute not only reduced-parameter but also reduced-parameter-order models that are far more efficient than what was possible before. For a variety of interconnect modeling problems, it is shown that the proposed parameter reduction technique can provide more than one order of magnitude reduction in parameter dimensionality. Such parameter reduction immediately leads to reduced simulation cost in sampling-based performance analysis, and more importantly, highly efficient parameterized interconnect reduced order models. As a general parameter dimension reduction methodology, it is anticipated that the proposed technique is broadly applicable to a variety of statistical circuit modeling problems, thereby offering a useful framework for controlling the complexity of statistical circuit analysis","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110139","","Analytical models;Circuit analysis;Circuit simulation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance analysis;Power system interconnection;Power system modeling;Space technology;Vehicles;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;reduced order systems","VLSI;complex simulation;parameter dimensionality;parameterized systems;performance variability;performance-oriented statistical parameter dimension reduction;reduced rank regression;reduced-parameter-order model;statistical circuit analysis;statistical circuit modeling;variability modeling","","20","","19","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, fast and accurate communication is needed to predict the performance of a system. Recently, transaction level modeling (TLM) is used to speedup communication simulation at the cost of accuracy. This paper proposes a novel modeling technique called result oriented modeling (ROM) which removes the accuracy drawback of TLM. Using ROM, models yield the same speed as their TLM counterparts, yet still are 100% accurate in timing. ROM utilizes the fact that internal states in the communication channel are not observable by the caller. Hence, ROM omits the internal states entirely and optimistically predicts the end result. Retroactively, the outcome is checked and, if necessary, corrective measures are taken to maintain the accuracy of the model. In this paper, we apply ROM to the AMBA AHB bus architecture. Our experimental results show that ROM exhibits the same high simulation performance as traditional TLM, yet it retains the same accuracy as the bus functional model.

This logic is well suited for equivalence checking of two versions of a hardware design or the input and output of a compiler and has been recently utilized in several model checkers. Our method follows the general satisfiability modulo theories or SMT(T) framework and combines a DPLL-style SAT solver with two theory solvers; one specific to equality and the other to separation inequality atoms within CLU. By adopting a combined implication scheme, we coordinate the efforts among theory solvers, and by efficiently processing uninterpreted functions involved in conflicts, we considerably improve the effectiveness of SAT learning and backtracking routines. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our SMT(CLU) procedure and compare its performance to recent solvers on a wide range of hardware verification benchmarks","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110136","","Arithmetic;Boolean functions;Computer science;Counting circuits;Data structures;Formal verification;Hardware;Logic design;Permission;Scalability","computability;formal verification","SAT-based decision method;SMT(CLU);formal verification;hardware design;model checker;satisfiability modulo theories;separation inequality;system verification","","0","","23","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assigning individual bias control to each gate leads to severe overhead, rendering the method impractical. However, assigning a single bias control to all gates in the circuit prevents the method from compensating for intra-die variation and greatly reduces its effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new variability-aware method that clusters gates at design time into a handful of carefully chosen independent body bias groups, which are then individually tuned post-silicon for each die. We show that this allows us to obtain near-optimal performance and power characteristics with minimal overhead. For each gate, we generate the probability distribution of its post-silicon ideal body bias voltage using an efficient sampling method. We then use these distributions and their correlations to drive a statistically-aware clustering technique. We study the physical design constraints and show how the area and wirelength overhead can be significantly limited using the proposed method.

One way to do this is by simulation, but that is computationally expensive and gets prohibitive for large circuits with a large variety of possible operational modes. Another limitation of a simulation-based approach is that it requires complete knowledge of the logic circuitry drawing current from the grid, thus precluding grid verification early in the design process. In this paper, we model the grid as an RLC circuit and we propose three verification techniques that can be applied in the early stages of the design process. These techniques do not require exact knowledge of the circuit currents. Instead, the currents drawn by the logic beneath the power grid are described by means of current constraints that capture the uncertainty about circuit details and activity. The first verification approach gives the exact worst-case voltage drop at every node of the grid, but it is slow. A second faster approach gives conservative bounds on the worst-case voltage drop at every node of the grid. The third approach is much faster; it is a conservative approach which simply checks if the grid voltage drop exceeds some pre-defined thresholds, without actually computing the worst-case voltage drop at every node","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110164","","Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Inductance;Integrated circuit synthesis;Logic circuits;Logic design;Power grids;Process design;RLC circuits;Threshold voltage","RLC circuits;electric potential;inductance;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","RLC circuit;inductance;integrated circuit design verification;power grid verification;voltage drop","","8","","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a platform-based resource-binding approach using a distributed register-file microarchitecture (DRFM) that makes efficient use of distributed embedded memory blocks as register files in modern FPGAs. A DRFM contains multiple islands, each having a local register file, a functional unit pool and data-routing logic. Compared with the traditional discrete-register counterpart, a DRFM allows use of the platform-featured on-chip memory or register-file IP blocks to implement its local register files, and this results in substantial saving of multiplexing logic and global interconnects. DRFM provides a useful architectural template and a direct optimization objective for minimizing inter-island connections for synthesis algorithms. Based on DRFM, we propose a novel binding algorithm focusing on the minimization of the inter-island connections. By applying our approach, significant reductions on multiplexors and global-interconnections are observed.

Moreover, elevated substrate (junction or die) temperature strongly influences IC performance, reliability, and packaging/cooling cost. Hence, accurate estimation of substrate thermal profiles is critical. This paper presents an accurate chip-level electrothermally-aware methodology for spatial silicon substrate temperature estimation. The methodology self-consistently incorporates various electrothermal couplings arising mainly due to the strong dependence of subthreshold leakage on temperature and also employs an accurate package thermal model, to account for inhomogeneous layers and non-cubic structure, which are not considered in traditional methods. The proposed methodology becomes increasingly effective as technology scales due to increasing leakage. Furthermore, it is shown that considering realistic package thermal models not only improves the accuracy of estimating temperature distribution but also has significant implications for power estimation and hot-spot management","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110233","","CMOS technology;Cooling;Electrothermal effects;Energy management;Integrated circuit packaging;Power dissipation;Technology management;Temperature;Thermal management;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;power system management;system-on-chip","CMOS technology;IC performance;IC reliability;VLSI design;electrothermal couplings;electrothermally-aware full-chip substrate temperature gradient evaluation;hot-spot management;leakage dominant technologies;package thermal model;power dissipation;power estimation;spatial silicon substrate temperature estimation;substrate thermal profiles;subthreshold leakage;temperature distribution","","4","","33","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With such large-scale integration and increasing power densities, thermal management continues to be a significant design effort to maintain performance and reliability in modern process technologies. In this paper, we present two mechanisms to perform frequency scaling as part of dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) to assist dynamic thermal management (DTM). Our frequency selection algorithms incorporate the physical interaction of the cores on a large-scale system onto the emergency intervention mechanisms for temperature reduction of the hotspot, while aiming to minimize the performance impact of frequency scaling on the core that is in thermal emergency. Our results show that our algorithm consistently succeeds in maximizing the operating frequency of the most critical core while successfully relieving the thermal emergency of the core. A comparison of our two alternative techniques reveals that our physical aware criticality-based algorithm results in 11.7% faster clock frequencies compared to our aggressive scaling algorithm.

Existing methods are inadequate when dealing with real-life distributions of process and environmental parameters, and limited availability of parameter data during early design. This paper proposes a robust technique for full-chip parametric yield estimation; the proposed work is based on the rigorous notions of non-parametric robust statistics which permits estimation based on the knowledge of the range and the limited number of moments (e.g. mean and variance) of the parameter distributions. Fully or partially specified process and environmental parameters can be described by robust representations, and used to estimate probabilistic bounds for leakage dissipation. The proposed approach is applied to estimating the chip-level parametric yield.

In this paper, given a set of target critical paths, we propose a two-stage method to find a set of robust-testable paths (with smaller number than the original set). The first stage constructs a necessary subset for critical robust paths, and the second stage identifies remaining functional sensitizable segments and their corresponding composing robust paths. The experiments show that a large percentage (several benchmarks close to 100%, 75% on average) of critical paths can be covered for most circuits. All paths and coverage are verified to match the best possible results.

Modern FPGA soft-cores are parameterized to support application-specific customization, wherein pre-defined units, such as a multiplication unit or floating-point unit, may be included in the microprocessor architecture to speed up software execution at the expense of increased size. We introduce a methodology for fast application-specific customization of a parameterized FPGA soft core, using synthesis and execution to obtain size and performance data in order to create a tool that can be used across a variety of tool platforms and FPGA devices. As synthesizing a soft core takes tens of minutes, developing heuristics that execute in an acceptable time of an hour or two, yet find near-optimal results, is a challenge. We consider two approaches, one using a traditional CAD approach that does an initial characterization using synthesis to create an abstract problem model and then explores the solution space using a knapsack algorithm, and the other using a synthesis-in-the-loop exploration approach. We compare approaches for a variety of design constraints, on 11 EEMBC benchmarks, using an actual Xilinx soft-core processor, and for two different commercial Xilinx FPGA devices. Our results show that the approaches can generate a customized configuration exhibiting roughly 2x speedups over a base soft core, reaching within 4% of optimal in about 1.5 hours, including complete synthesis of the soft-core onto the FPGA, compared to over 11 hours for exhaustive search. Our results also show that including synthesis-in-the-loop, compared to a traditional CAD approach, improved speedups by an average of 20% when size constraints were tight.

Most of the previous work focused mainly on efficient modeling of volume discretized interconnects using several integration and reduction techniques. However, little work has been done to characterize when using the simple DC model has an impact on critical circuit metrics such as delay, impedance etc. Most of the previous work simply assumes that when skin depth becomes smaller than the wire cross section dimensions, volume discretization becomes essential. However, careful analysis in this paper shows that this assumption is invalid and a figure of merit is derived to characterize when volume discretization of single and coupled wires is required.

Therefore, wire density rather than congestion should be a unified metric to improve both CMP variation and timing. The proposed wire density driven global routing is implemented in a congestion-driven global router (M. Cho and D. Z. Pan, 2006) for CMP and timing optimization. The new global router utilizes several novel techniques to reduce the wire density of CMP and timing hotspots. Our experimental results are very encouraging.

This article describes ISAC, a novel, fast, accurate thermal analysis system for use in IC synthesis and design. We present new, cooperative, temporal and spatial adaptation methods to dramatically accelerate accurate analysis. The proposed system unifies steady-state, time-domain, and frequency-domain analysis techniques.

Together, these cooperative adaptation and multi-domain analysis techniques allow the proposed system to efficiently solve the static, short time scale, and long time scale variants of the IC thermal analysis problem. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement over existing thermal analysis solutions. Our spatial adaptation techniques bring a 21.6times -690.0times speedup over recently-published steady-state thermal analysis techniques. Our unified spatial and temporal adaptation techniques, within our asynchronous time marching method, bring a 1,071times -1,890times speedup over other widely-used, time-domain thermal analysis techniques with less than 0.5% error. Our spatial adaptation techniques enable the efficient use of our frequency-domain thermal analysis technique, which brings a 10times - 100times speedup over the fastest-known time-domain technique, when used for long time scale thermal analysis.

In this work, we analyze one example of timing-dependent effects, cross-coupling capacitance, and the complex problem space created by considering coupling and process variations together. The delay of a critical path under these conditions is difficult to bound for design and test. We develop a methodology that analyzes this complex space by decomposing the problem space along three dimensions: the aggressor space, test space, and sample space. For design, we utilize an OBDD-based approach to prune the aggressor space based on logical constraints, which can be combined with a worst-case timing window simulator to prune based on both logical and timing constraints. After pruning, the reduced aggressor space can be used to derive a more accurate timing bound. Solving the problems in the test and sample spaces is postponed to the post-silicon stage, where we propose a test selection methodology for bounding the delay of every sample. This methodology is based on probability density estimation and has a tradeoff between the number of tests to apply and the tightness of the delay bound obtained.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","464","471","Because of the increasing dominance of interconnect issues in advanced IC technology, placement has become a critical step in the IC design flow. To get accurate interconnect information during the placement process, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into it. However, previous global routers are computationally expensive. It is impractical to perform global routing repeatedly during placement. In this paper, we present an extremely fast and high-quality global router called FastRoute. In traditional global routing approaches, congestion is not considered during Steiner tree construction. So they have to rely on the time-consuming maze routing technique to eliminate routing congestion. Different from traditional approaches, we proposed a congestion-driven Steiner tree topology generation technique and an edge shifting technique to determine the good Steiner tree topologies and Steiner node positions. Based on the congestion-driven Steiner trees, we only need to apply maze routing to a small percentage of the two-pin nets once to obtain high quality global routing solutions. We also proposed a new cost function based on logistic function to direct the maze routing. Experimental results show that FastRoute generates less congested solutions in 132times and 64times faster runtimes than the state-of-the-art academic global routers Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al, 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (R. T. Hadsell and P. H. Madden, 2003), respectively. It is even faster than the highly-efficient congestion estimator FaDGloR (J. Westra and P. Groeneveld, 2005). The promising results make it possible to incorporate global routing directly into placement process without much runtime penalty. This could dramatically improve the placement solution quality.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","680","687",".FPGA device area is dominated by interconnect, so low-cost FPGA architectures often have reduced interconnect capacity. This limited routing capacity creates a hard channel width constraint that can make it difficult for CAD tools to successfully map a circuit into these devices. Instead of migrating a design to a high-cost, resource-rich architecture that is easier to route, we present a cheaper alternative: a fully automated CAD flow (Un/DoPack) that finds local regions of high interconnect demand and reduces it by spreading out the logic in that region. This is done by introducing whitespace in the form of empty logic elements (LEs) within the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) of the congested region. After spreading, the congested region occupies more routing channels and so obtains access to greater aggregate interconnect capacity. Although this has the side effect of using more CLBs, it has the advantage of lowering peak interconnect demands and making a previously-unroutable circuit routable. We also design a new set of synthetic benchmark circuits that model interconnect variation within a large design. Using these benchmarks, we show that circuits with high interconnect variation require FPGA devices to have large channel widths. However, since congestion of such circuits is localized, Un/DoPack is very good at reducing the peak demands of circuits with high interconnect variation. Our results suggest that even for an average Rent exponent of 0.62 (a modest value), a large variation of this exponent within a design will also require FPGAs to have large channel widths. Thus, it is crucial to study interconnect variation of benchmark circuits when designing low-cost FPGAs. Previous research studying interconnect properties focuses on average Rent exponent values of each design, but we believe new work should study variation as well. For circuits with high interconnect variation, we demonstrate that channel widths can be reduced by up to ~40% with only ~10% in- - crease in area","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110252","Channel Width Constraints;Clustering;Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA);Packing","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Costs;Design automation;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic design;Routing;System-on-a-chip","benchmark testing;circuit testing;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD","CAD tools;Un/DoPack;configurable logic blocks;fully automated CAD flow;high interconnect demand;interconnect capacity reduction;interconnect variation;large system-on-chip designs;logic elements;low-cost FPGA architectures;peak interconnect demands;resource-rich architecture;routing channels;synthetic benchmark circuits","","4","","13","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a migration flow which consists of two process steps: (1) conversion where shapes (such as polygons) are converted to simple geometric objects (such as sticks) while the topology is maintained; and (2) grid legalization for RDRs where the simple geometric objects are placed on grid subject to the given set of ground rules by using a novel legalization algorithm, the minimum perturbation-driven graph-based grid legalization (MP-GGL) algorithm.

"Post-Routing Redundant Via Insertion and Line End Extension with Via Density Consideration","Kuang-Yao Lee; Ting-Chi Wang; Kai-Yuan Chao","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Nat.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","633","640","Redundant via insertion and line end extension employed in the post-routing stage are two well known and highly recommended techniques to reduce yield loss due to via failure. However, if the amount of inserted redundant vias is not well controlled, it could violate via density rules and adversely worsen the yield and reliability of the design. In this paper, we first study the problem of redundant via insertion, and present two methods to accelerate a state-of-the-art approach (which is based on a maximum independent set (MIS) formulation) to solve it. We then consider the problem of simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension. We formulate the problem as a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem and modify the accelerated MIS-based approach to solve it. Lastly, we investigate the problem of simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension subject to the maximum via density rule, and present a two-stage approach for it. In the first stage, we ignore the maximum via density rule, and enhance the MWIS-based approach to find the set of regions which violate the maximum via density rule after performing simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension. In the second stage, excess redundant vias are removed from those violating regions such that after the removal, the maximum via density rule is met while the total amount of redundant vias removed is minimized. This density-aware redundant via removal problem is formulated as a set of zero-one integer linear programming (0-1 ILP) problems each of which can be solved independently without sacrificing the optimality. The superiorities of our approaches are all demonstrated through promising experimental results","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110243","","Acceleration;Chaos;Computer science;Contact resistance;Design for manufacture;Integrated circuit layout;Manufacturing processes;Permission;Routing;Timing","linear programming;manufacturing processes","density consideration;line end extension;maximum independent set formulation;maximum via density rule;maximum weighted independent set problem;post-routing redundant via insertion;via failure;yield loss reduction;zero-one integer linear programming","","8","","17","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the efficient implementation of the new architectural features, a radically new approach inspired by Sproull's counterflow pipelines (1994) is proposed. The key idea is to allow special commands, called anti-tokens, to be propagated in a direction opposite to that of data, allowing certain computations to be killed before they are completed, if their results are no longer required. The net impact is a significant improvement in the throughput of a certain class of systems - e.g., those involving conditional computation - where a bottleneck pipeline stage can often be preempted if its result is determined to be no longer needed.

This paper presents novel circuit optimization techniques to mitigate soft error rates (SER) of combinational logic circuits. First, we propose a gate sizing algorithm that trades off SER reduction and area overhead. This approach first computes bounds on the maximum achievable SER reduction by resizing a gate. This bound is then used to prune the circuit graph, arriving at a smaller set of candidate gates on which we perform incremental sensitivity computations to determine the gates that are the largest contributors to circuit SER. Second, we propose a flipflop selection method that uses slack information at each primary output node to determine the flipflop configuration that produces maximum SER savings. This approach uses an enhanced flipflop library that contains flipflops of varying temporal masking ability. Third, we propose a unified, co-optimization approach combining flipflop selection with the gate sizing algorithm. The joint optimization algorithm produces larger SER reductions while incurring smaller circuit overhead than either technique taken in isolation. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show SER reductions of 7.9times with gate sizing, 6.6times with flipflop assignment, and 28.2times for the combined optimization approach, with no delay penalties and area overheads within 5-6%.

We propose algorithms to embed thermal sensors into a regular structure to minimize the number of sensors and determine sensor locations required to maintain a given accuracy in temperature sensing for a given design. Our algorithms are tailored for minimal usage of thermal sensors to suit a variety of architectural conditions. For programmable logic arrays the highly application-specific usage of the hardware resources leads to unpredictable thermal profiles. As a result, post-manufacture instantiation of thermal sensors is desired, which in turn demands the use of native hardware resources, which can be scarce.

In addition, Inferno can automatically generate a checker module corresponding to a given transaction, suitable for use in a wide range of verification methodologies.

Most previous approaches to addressing this problem require drastic changes to coding practice. We present an approach that instead requires only minimal changes but yields significant speedups. In this approach, a software developer initially writes C code as they normally would, and then applies simple refinement guidelines to only the performance-critical code regions, which are the regions most likely to be synthesized to hardware. Alternatively, if a designer is aware of performance-critical parts of the application, the guidelines could be followed during development. In this study, we analyze dozens of embedded benchmarks to determine the most common C coding practices that limit hardware performance, and introduce coding guidelines to make the code more amenable to synthesis. Those guidelines typically require minimal coding effort, generally consisting of less than ten lines of code for each guideline. The guidelines typically represent modifications that require designer knowledge, making the guidelines difficult or impossible for synthesis tools to automate. We apply these guidelines to six benchmarks, resulting in average speedups of 3.5times compared to synthesis from the original code with a negligible software size and performance overhead","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110257","FPGA;Synthesis;code refinement;coding guidelines;compilation;embedded systems;hardware/software partitioning","Application software;Computer languages;Computer science;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Field programmable gate arrays;Guidelines;Hardware design languages;Permission;Software performance","C language;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign","C constructs;C language;FPGA;code refinement;embedded benchmarks;embedded systems;hardware synthesis;hardware-software partitioning;performance improved synthesis;performance-critical parts;software programming languages;synthesized hardware","","6","","17","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"PPV-HB: Harmonic Balance for Oscillator/PLL Phase Macromodels","Ting Mei; Roychowdhury, J.","Minnesota Univ.","Computer-Aided Design, 2006. ICCAD '06. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","283","288","A unique feature of oscillators is that small but sustained external perturbations lead to unboundedly large changes in phase, thereby making standard harmonic balance (HB) inapplicable to realistic oscillator phase macromodels. In this paper, we rectify this situation by presenting a novel extension of HB that is capable of handling oscillator phase macro-models. Key to the new method, termed PPV-HB, is a formulation that separates unboundedly increasing phase terms from the bounded, periodic components. PPV-HB can be used not only on individual oscillators, but it also enables the application of HB-like techniques for simulating system-level equation systems composed of higher-level macromodels of blocks. We validate PPV-HB on individual oscillators and a PLL system, demonstrating excellent matches with transient simulation using phase macromodels. Speedups of 1-2 orders of magnitude are obtained, over and above additional speedups of another 2-3 orders of magnitude that stem from using macromodels (as opposed to full circuit simulation)","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110187","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Frequency;Injection-locked oscillators;Nonlinear equations;Permission;Phase locked loops;Ring oscillators;Transient analysis;Voltage-controlled oscillators","oscillators;phase locked loops","PLL phase macromodels;harmonic balance;oscillator phase macromodel","","3","","16","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be useful, however, it is important that the error introduced in SSTA be significantly smaller than the manufacturing variations being modeled. Achieving such accuracy requires careful attention to the delay models and to the algorithms applied. In this paper, we propose a new sparse-matrix based framework for accurate path-based SSTA, motivated by the observation that the number of timing paths in practice is sub-quadratic based on a study of industrial circuits and the ISCAS89 benchmarks. Our sparse-matrix based formulation has the following advantages: (a) It places no restrictions on process parameter distributions; (b) It embeds accurate polynomial-based delay model which takes into account slope propagation naturally; (c) It takes advantage of the matrix sparsity and high performance linear algebra for efficient implementation.

The test cost of such devices is an appreciable percentage of the overall cost, which typically results from the high number of specifications, the high number of distinct test set-ups and equipment pieces that need to be used, and the high cost of each test set-up. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of EVM measurements to test the variable-envelope WLAN (wireless local area networks) receiver and transmitter characteristics. The goal is to optimize EVM test parameters (input data and test limits) and to reduce the number of specification measurements that require high test times and/or expensive test equipment.

It has been shown that network coding can increase the throughput of multicast communication. In this paper, we explore the benefits of network coding for improving the routing characteristics of VLSI designs. We demonstrate that when data has to be routed across the IC, it is often beneficial to perform network coding.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","244","250","One of the previously-proposed techniques for reducing memory energy consumption is memory banking. The idea is to divide the memory space into multiple banks and place currently unused (idle) banks into a low-power operating mode. The prior studies - both hardware and software domain - in memory energy optimization via low-power modes do not take the data cache behavior explicitly into account. As a consequence, the energy savings achieved by these techniques can be unpredictable due to dynamic cache behavior at runtime. The main contribution of this paper is a compiler optimization, called the bank-aware cache miss clustering, that increases idle durations of memory banks, and as a result, enables better exploitation of available low-power capabilities supported by the memory system.

From the one side, performance models can be affected by residual errors and usually do not consider process variations and modeling uncertainties. Conversely, behavioral models cannot match accurate circuit level simulations, so that during the mapping (exploration) process circuit configurations difficult to be realized may be obtained. We propose a methodology that extends techniques from optimization and design centering to system level analog design exploiting general, implicit architectural constraints to control the robustness of the solution.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","297","302","Traditionally, at early design stages, leakage power is associated with the number of transistors in a design. Hence, intuitively an implementation with minimum resource usage would be best for low leakage. Such an allocation would generally be followed by switching optimal resource binding to achieve a low power design. This treatment of leakage power is unaware of operating conditions such as temperature. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce the total leakage power of a design by identifying the optimal number of resources during allocation and binding. We demonstrate that, contrary to the general tendency to minimize the number of resources, the best solution can actually be achieved if a certain degree of redundancy is allowed. This is due to the fact that leakage is strongly dependent on the on-chip temperature profile. Distributing activity over a higher number of resources can reduce power density, remove potential hotspots and subsequently minimize thermal induced leakage. On the other hand, using an arbitrarily high number of resources will not yield the best solution. In this paper, we show that there is a power density, hence, temperature, at which the total leakage power will reach its optimal value. Such an optimal resource number can be a better starting point for the subsequent switching-driven low power binding. We also present a high-level power density-aware leakage model. Based on the estimates by this model, we optimize the total leakage power by 53.8% on average compared to the minimum resource binding, and 35.7% on average compared to a temperature-aware resource binding technique","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110189","","Circuits;Computer science;Design optimization;Permission;Resource management;Subthreshold current;Temperature dependence;Thermal engineering;Threshold voltage;Transistors","power aware computing;resource allocation","on-chip temperature;power density-aware leakage model;redundant resource allocation;thermal-induced leakage power optimization","","0","2","16","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a design methodology that automates the synthesis of such application-specific NoC architectures. We present a floorplan aware design method that considers the wiring complexity of the NoC during the topology synthesis process. This leads to detecting timing violations on the NoC links early in the design cycle and to have accurate power estimations of the interconnect. We incorporate mechanisms to prevent deadlocks during routing, which is critical for proper operation of NoCs. We integrate the NoC synthesis method with an existing design flow, automating NoC synthesis, generation, simulation and physical design processes. We also present ways to ensure design convergence across the levels. Experiments on several SoC benchmarks are presented, which show that the synthesized topologies provide a large reduction in network power consumption (2.78 times on average) and improvement in performance (1.59 times on average) over the best mesh and mesh-based custom topologies. An actual layout of a multimedia SoC with the NoC designed using our methodology is presented, which shows that the designed NoC supports the required frequency of operation (close to 900 MHz) without any timing violations.

They have large delays and are error-prone. Especially, in system-on-chip (SoC) designs, where parallel interconnects run over large distances, the effects of crosstalk are detrimental to the overall system performance due to the large delays and un-reliability involved. This paper presents an information theoretic approach to address delay and reliability in long interconnects. A framework to calculate the capacity of a physical wire is laid out herein. The results for 8-bit wide buses of varying lengths in 0.1/mum technology are also presented. The wires are modeled based on their calculated parasitic (R,L,C) values and the coupling (C,L) parameters. Using this model, results are obtained for the data transfer capacity of long interconnects. It is seen that for wide buses, the signal delay distribution has a long tail, meaning that most signals arrive at the output much faster than the worst case delay. Using communication-theory, these ""good"" signals arriving early can be used to predict/correct the ""few"" signals arriving late. Further, results show that for every bus configuration, there exists an optimal frequency of transmission that will result in the maximum data transfer rate. Also, this optimal frequency is higher than the pessimistic worst case delay based clock design","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110191","","Added delay;Computer errors;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Frequency;Reliability theory;System performance;System-on-a-chip;Very large scale integration;Wire","logic design;system-on-chip","SoC design;coupling parameter;parasitic value;signal delay distribution;system-on-chip","","1","1","20","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This variability manifests itself by increasing the number and criticality of long delay paths. To quantify this impact, we use an architectural process variation model that is appropriate for the analysis of system performance in the early-stages of the design process. We propose a method of selecting microarchitectural parameters to mitigate the frequency impact due to process variability for distinct structures, while minimizing IPC (instructions-per-cycle) loss. We propose an optimization procedure to be used for system-level design decisions, and we find that joint architecture and statistical timing analysis can be more advantageous than pure circuit level optimization. Overall, the technique can improve the 90% yield frequency by about 14% with 3% IPC loss for a baseline machine with a 20FO4 logic depth per pipestage.

However, in some cases it may be required/preferable to use variations of the general SAT problem. In this paper we consider one important variation, the minimum-cost satisfiability problem (MinCostSAT). MinCostSAT is a SAT problem which minimizes the cost of the satisfying assignment. MinCostSAT has various applications, e.g. automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), FPGA routing, AI planning, etc. This problem has been tackled before - first by covering algorithms, e.g. scherzo (Coudert, 1996), and more recently by SAT based algorithms, e.g. bsolo (Manquinho and Marques-Silva, 2002). However the SAT algorithms they are based on are not the current generation of highly efficient solvers. The solvers in this generation, e.g. Chaff (Moskewicz et al., 2001), MiniSat (Een and Sorensson, 2006) etc., incorporate several new advances, e.g. two literal watching based Boolean Constraint Propagation, that have delivered order of magnitude speedups. We first point out the challenges in using this class of solvers for the MinCostSAT problem and then present techniques to overcome these challenges. The resulting solver MinCostChaff shows order of magnitude improvement over several current best known branch-and-bound solvers for a large class of problems, ranging from minimum test pattern generation, bounded model checking in EDA to graph coloring and planning in AI","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110137","Boolean Satisfiability;Branch-and-Bound;MinCostSAT","Artificial intelligence;Automatic test pattern generation;Business continuity;Costs;Counting circuits;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Permission;Test pattern generators","computability;constraint handling;tree searching","Boolean constraint propagation;Boolean satisfiability;SAT based branch-and-bound search;minimum-cost satisfiability problem","","4","2","21","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method, which is based on introducing the concept of an effective deadline, utilizes the correlation between consecutive values of the workload. In practice because the frequency and voltage update rates are dynamically set based on variable update interval lengths, voltage fluctuations on the power network are also minimized.

At-speed test application allows a circuit to be tested under its normal operation conditions. However, fault simulation and test generation for the existing fault models become significantly more complex due to the need to handle faulty signal-transitions that span multiple clock cycles. The proposed fault model alleviates this shortcoming by introducing unspecified values into the faulty circuit when fault effects may occur. Fault detection potentially occurs when an unspecified value reaches a primary output. Due to the uncertainty that an unspecified value propagated to a primary output will be different from the fault free value, an inherent requirement in this model is that a fault would be potentially detected multiple times in order to increase the likelihood of detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the model behaves as expected in terms of fault coverage and numbers of detections of target faults.

For computing the statistical max of two arrival time probability distributions, existing analytical SSTA approaches use the results given by Clark (1961). These analytical results are exact when the two operand arrival time distributions have jointly Gaussian distributions. Due to the nonlinear max operation, arrival time distributions are typically skewed. Furthermore, nonlinear dependence of gate delays and non-Gaussian process parameters also make the arrival time distributions asymmetric. Therefore, for computing the max accurately, a new approach is required that accounts for the inherent skewness in arrival time distributions. In this work, we present analytical solution for computing the statistical max operation. First, the skewness in arrival time distribution is modeled by matching its first three moments to a so-called skewed normal distribution. Then by extending Clark's work to handle skewed normal distributions we derive analytical expressions for computing the moments of the max. We then show using initial simulations results that using a skewness based max operation has a significant potential to improve the accuracy of the statistical max operation in SSTA while retaining its computational efficiency","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110180","","Delay effects;Digital circuits;Distributed computing;Electric variables;Gaussian distribution;Integrated circuit interconnections;Permission;Probability distribution;Random variables;Timing","digital circuits;statistical analysis;timing circuits","Gaussian distribution;digital circuit;probability distribution;statistical max operation;statistical timing analysis","","15","3","19","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In region-based MSV, circuits are partitioned into ""voltage islands"" where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one supply voltage. In a work by Wu et al. (2005), this supply voltage partitioning problem is addressed, and the input circuit is partitioned into a slicing structure with every voltage island rectangular in shape. This unnecessary restriction on the structure and island shapes has caused a significant degradation in the solution quality.

Methods for controlling individual NWs within a crossbar have also been proposed, but implementation remains a challenge. A NW decoder is a device that controls many NWs with a much smaller number of lithographically produced mesoscale wires (MWs). Unlike traditional demultiplexers, all proposed NW decoders are assembled stochastically. In a randomized-contact decoder (RCD) (Hogg et al., 2006), for example, field-effect transistors are randomly created at about half of the NW/MW junctions. In this paper, we tightly bound the number of MWs required to produce a correctly functioning RCD with high probability. We show that the number of MWs is logarithmic in the number of NWs, even when errors occur. We also analyze the overhead associated with controlling a stochastically assembled decoder. As we explain, lithographically-produced control circuitry must store information regarding which MWs control which NWs.

By viewing a wiring segment as an ""atomic object"" of perturbation, we can efficiently evaluate the effect of routing tree perturbation. We propose two complementary routing optimization methods, namely segment partitioning and segment migration. These targeted optimizers can improve congestion related routing objectives by quickly shuffling wiring segments across different routing channels. Our routing approach produces better results compared to rip-up and re-route method based router Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al. 2002) with average total overflow reduction of more than 88% while taking only 61% of runtime required by rip up and reroute phase of Labyrinth. When applied to the output of Labyrinth, the approach, on average, reduces the total overflow by more than 97% with complete overflow elimination for four circuits, while requiring additional runtime of just 33%.

The problem of placing devices with symmetry constraint has been extensively studied but none of the previous works has considered symmetry constraint with other placement constraints simultaneously. Instead of handling the constraints by having a penalty term in the cost function to penalize violations, a unified method is proposed that, by adjusting the edge weights in a pair of constraint graphs, can try to satisfy all the placement and symmetry constraints simultaneously in a candidate floorplan solution. The maximum distance of the modules in a symmetry group from the corresponding symmetry axis will be minimized in this weight adjusting step, in order to minimize the total packing area. We have compared our method with the most updated results on this problem (Balasa et al., 2004) when there are only symmetry constraints and results show that our approach can give solutions of better quality, in an acceptable amount of run time.

These problematic layout configurations need to be efficiently detected and eliminated from a design layout to enable better yield. In this paper, such layout configurations are called process-hotspots and an efficient and scalable algorithm is proposed to detect such process-hotspots in a given layout. The concept of a range pattern is introduced and used to accurately and compactly represent these process-hotspots. This representation is flexible and can incorporate information about the deficiencies of available modeling and/or subsequent correction (for instance, mask synthesis) techniques. Each range pattern can also be associated with a scoring mechanism to score the problem regions according to yield impact. A library of range patterns is being developed in collaboration with a fab. The proposed process-hotspot detection system assumes that process-hotspots are specified as a library of range patterns and determines all occurrences of any of these range patterns in a layout. It is fast and accurate and can be applied to large industrial layouts. Unlike previous work, the proposed scheme can identify problems that cannot be efficiently modeled or corrected by subsequent mask synthesis techniques and can thereby complement existing work in that area.

There are several limited works on the device and circuit characterizations for the post-OPC non-ideal-shape wafer images, with significant impacts on timing and power. Most of them, however, are based on the equivalent gate length models, which are different for timing and leakage, and thus hard to use for coherent circuit simulations. In this paper, we propose a unified post-litho device characterization model and circuit simulation for timing and power. To our best knowledge, this is the most accurate methodology for post-litho analysis, including timing, leakage and transient simulation. Based on this method, the parameter extraction is also included in the model which was omitted by previous works. A post-litho model card is proposed for circuit simulation to combine these two techniques.

In the GAPLA architecture, The FPGA area is divided into locally synchronous blocks and the communications between them arc through asynchronous I/O interfaces. An automatic design flow is developed for the GAPLA architecture. Starting from behavioral description, a design is partitioned into smaller modules and fit to GAPLA synchronous blocks. The asynchronous communications between modules are then synthesized. The CAD flow is parameterized in modeling the GAPLA architecture. By manipulating the parameters, we could study different factors of the designed GAPLA architecture.

"Analysis and Modeling of CD Variation for Statistical Static Timing","Cline, B.; Chopra, K.; Blaauw, D.; Yu Cao","Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI","Computer-Aided Design, 2006. ICCAD '06. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","60","66","Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) has become a key method for analyzing the effect of process variation in aggressively scaled CMOS technologies. Much research has focused on the modeling of spatial correlation in SSTA. However, the vast majority of these works used artificially generated process data to test the proposed models. Hence, it is difficult to determine the actual effectiveness of these methods, the conditions under which they are necessary, and whether they lead to a significant increase in accuracy that warrants their increased runtime and complexity. In this paper, we study 5 different correlation models and their associated SSTA methods using 35420 critical dimension (CD) measurements that were extracted from 23 reticles on 5 wafers in a 130nm CMOS process. Based on the measured CD data, we analyze the correlation as a function of distance and generate 5 distinct correlation models, ranging from simple models which incorporate one or two variation components to more complex models that utilize principle component analysis and quad-trees. We then study the accuracy of the different models and compare their SSTA results with the result of running STA directly on the extracted data. We also examine the trade-off between model accuracy and run time, as well as the impact of die size on model accuracy. We show that, especially for small dies (6.6mm times 5.7mm), the simple models provide comparable accuracy to that of the more complex ones, while incurring significantly less runtime and implementation difficulty. The results of this study demonstrate that correlation models for SSTA must be carefully tested on actual process data and must be used judiciously","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110154","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuits;Delay;Principal component analysis;Random variables;Runtime;Semiconductor device modeling;Testing;Timing","delay circuits;principal component analysis;timing circuits","correlation model;critical dimension data;critical dimension measurement;critical dimension variation;principle component analysis;quad-trees;statistical static timing analysis","","29","2","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","19","26","Parametric yield loss due to variability can be effectively reduced by both design-time optimization strategies and by adjusting circuit parameters to the realizations of variable parameters. The two levels of tuning operate within a single variability budget, and because their effectiveness depends on the magnitude and the spatial structure of variability their joint co-optimization is required. In this paper we develop a formal optimization algorithm for such co-optimization and link it to the control and measurement overhead via the formal notions of measurement and control complexity. We describe an optimization strategy that unifies design-time gate-level sizing and post-silicon adaptation using adaptive body bias at the chip level. The statistical formulation utilizes adjustable robust linear programming to derive the optimal policy for assigning body bias once the uncertain variables, such as gate length and threshold voltage, are known. Computational tractability is achieved by restricting optimal body bias selection policy to be an affine function of uncertain variables. We demonstrate good run-time and show that 5-35% savings in leakage power across the benchmark circuits are possible. Dependence of results on measurement and control complexity is studied and points of diminishing returns for both metrics are identified","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110148","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Permission;Robustness;Semiconductor device measurement;Threshold voltage;Timing","adaptive systems;circuit CAD;optimisation;stability","adaptive body bias;adjustable robust linear programming;adjustable robust optimization;affine function;benchmark circuit;computational tractability;control complexity;formal optimization algorithm;gate-level sizing;joint design-time;leakage power;optimal body bias selection policy;parametric yield loss;post-silicon adaptation;post-silicon minimization;statistical formulation","","22","1","28","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our DRP architecture has a stand alone finite state machine and that switches ""contexts"" consisting of many operational and storage units in processing elements (PEs) and wires between them. Utilizing the resources not only in two spatial dimensions but also vertically (time-multiplexed) under accurate timing and area constraints imposes challenges for a high-level synthesizer for the DRP. We describe a C-based behavioral synthesis method which features datapath generation with clock speed optimization. This is achieved by including the overhead of selectors in the scheduling algorithm, and considering a wire delay at each PE level. A new technique is introduced to achieve high area efficiency. It works by effectively allocating multiple steps into the context. From the original high-level synthesizer for application-specific integrated circuits, some of the basic rules such as operator and register sharing were completely changed due to the coarse grained and multi-context architecture. Experimental results show that the generated data paths are highly parallelized and well balanced between contexts.

Low power design techniques such as voltage scaling, dual-V<sub>th</sub> etc. can have a large negative impact on parametric yield. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for low-power variation-tolerant circuit design, which allows aggressive voltage scaling. The principal idea is to (a) isolate and predict the set of possible paths that may become critical under process variations, (b) ensure that they are activated rarely, and (c) avoid possible delay failures in the critical paths by dynamically switching to two-cycle operation (assuming all standard operations are single cycle), when they are activated. This allows us to operate the circuit at reduced supply voltage while achieving the required yield. Simulation results on a set of benchmark circuits at 70nm process technology show average power reduction of 60% with less than 10% performance overhead and 18% overhead in die-area compared to conventional synthesis. Application of the proposed methodology to pipelined design is also investigated","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320025","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110241","","Circuit synthesis;Delay;Design methodology;Dynamic voltage scaling;Logic design;Logic gates;Low voltage;Power dissipation;Robustness;Timing","circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;logic design;low-power electronics;power aware computing","circuit design;circuit simulation;critical path isolation;low power design;low-power variation-tolerant circuit synthesis;pipelined design;two-cycle operation;voltage scaling","","10","","12","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Song, 2006) has demonstrated that the variation between two devices on the same die due to random mismatch is inversely proportional to the square root of the device area: sigma ~ 1/sqrt(Area). Based on the Pelgrom model, analog devices are sized to be large enough to werage out random variations. Importantly, with CMOS scaling, variations due to random doping fluctuations are making it exceedingly difficult to control device mismatches by sizing alone; namely, the devices have to be made so large that the benefits of CMOS scaling are not realized for analog and RF circuits. In this paper we propose a novel post-silicon timing methodology to reduce random mismatches for analog circuits in sub-90 nm CMOS. A novel dynamic programming algorithm is incorporated into a fast Monte Carlo simulation flow for statistical analysis and optimization of the proposed tunable analog circuits. We apply the proposed post-silicon tuning methodology to several commonly-used analog circuit blocks. We demonstrate that with the post-silicon tuning, device mismatch exponentially decreases as area increases: sigma-exp(-alpha-Area).","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397306","","Analog circuits;CMOS analog integrated circuits;Circuit analysis;Circuit optimization;Doping;Fluctuations;Radio frequency;Semiconductor device modeling;Semiconductor process modeling;Timing","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;circuit tuning;dynamic programming;elemental semiconductors;silicon","CMOS scaling;Monte Carlo simulation flow;Pelgrom model;RF circuits;adaptive post-silicon tuning;analog circuits;dynamic programming algorithm;random doping fluctuations;statistical analysis","","9","1","24","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
