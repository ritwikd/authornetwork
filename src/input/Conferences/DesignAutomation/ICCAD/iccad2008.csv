IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","270","277","For the first time, a new source of random threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) fluctuation in emerging metal-gate transistors is identified, analytically modeled and investigated for its device and circuit-level implications. The new source of variability, christened work-function variation (WFV), is caused by the dependency of metal work-function on the orientation of its grains. A statistical framework is developed, which enables estimation of the key parameters of work-function distribution by identifying the physical dimensions of the devices and properties of materials used in the fabrication. This paper offers three major contributions for process, device and circuit designers. First, the proposed model can be employed to identify suitable materials and fabrication processes that can reduce the impact of Vth fluctuation due to WFV. For instance, four types of metal nitride gate materials (TiN and TaN for NMOS and WN and MoN for PMOS devices) are studied and it is shown that TiN and WN result in lower Vth fluctuation. Second, device engineers can benefit from the result of this work by evaluating the WFV level of various types of classical or non-classical metal-gate CMOS transistors. As an example, it is shown that FinFET transistors are less affected by WFV compared to FD-SOI and bulk-Si devices due to their larger gate area. Third, circuit designers can utilize this model to investigate the impact of such a variation on the key performance and reliability parameters of the circuits. For instance, an SRAM cell is analyzed in the presence of V<sub>th</sub> fluctuations due to WFV and it is shown that such variations can result in considerable performance and reliability degradation.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681585","","Circuit synthesis;Fabrication;FinFETs;Fluctuations;Inorganic materials;MOS devices;Random access memory;Semiconductor device modeling;Threshold voltage;Tin","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;parameter estimation;statistical analysis;tantalum compounds;titanium compounds","FinFET transistor;NMOS;PMOS devices;SRAM cell;TaN;TiN;christened work-function variation;circuit design;circuit-level implication;fabrication processes;metal-gate work-function variability;nonclassical metal-gate CMOS transistors;parameter estimation;random threshold voltage fluctuation;reliability parameter;statistical modeling;work-function distribution","","21","","42","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of building a complex model between the circuit timing and parameter variability, we build a model which adjusts an approximate variation-aware timing into an accurate one. The intuition is that it is simpler to build a model which adjusts an approximate estimate into an accurate one. It is also more efficient to obtain an approximate circuit timing model. The combination of these two observations makes the use of an adjustment-based model a good choice for SSTA with high dimension of parameter variability. To build the adjustment model, we use a simulation-based approach, which is based on Gaussian Process. Combined with intelligent sampling, we show that an adjustment-based model can more effectively capture the nonlinearity of the circuit timing with respect to parameter variability compared to polynomial modeling. We also show that with only 200 samples of the circuit timing and 42 independent parameter variations, adjustment-based modeling obtains higher accuracy than direct SSTA using quadratic modeling.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681571","","Circuit simulation;Delay;Flexible printed circuits;Gaussian processes;Integrated circuit interconnections;Monte Carlo methods;Polynomials;Sampling methods;Statistical analysis;Timing","Gaussian processes;polynomials;timing circuits","Gaussian process;adjustment-based modeling;circuit timing;intelligent sampling;parameter variability;quadratic modeling;statistical static timing analysis;variation-aware timing","","2","","12","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, we show that the timing variations are sparse in the wavelet domain. The sparsity is exploited for estimation of the gate delays using the compressed sensing theory. This estimation method requires significantly less number of timing measurements compared to the case where the dependence between the gate delays is not directly integrated within the estimation framework. We discuss a number of applications for the new post-silicon timing characterization method.

ICCAD 2008. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","698","705","Gate oxide breakdown is a key factor limiting the useful lifetime of an integrated circuit. Unfortunately, the conventional approach for full chip oxide reliability analysis assumes a uniform oxide-thickness for all devices. In practice, however, gate-oxide thickness varies from die-to-die and within-die and as the precision of process control worsens an alternative reliability analysis approach is needed. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for chip level gate oxide reliability analysis while considering both die-to-die and within-die components of thickness variation. The thickness of each device is modeled as a distinct random variable and thus the full chip reliability estimation problem is defined on a huge sample space of several million devices. We observe that the full chip oxide reliability is independent of the relative location of the individual devices. This enables us to transform the problem such that the resulting representation can be expressed in terms of only two distinct random variables. Using this transformation we present a computationally efficient and accurate approach for estimating the full chip reliability while considering spatial correlations of gateoxide thickness. We show that, compared to Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method incurs an error of only 1∼6% while improving the runtime by around three orders.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681653","","Dielectrics;Electric breakdown;Electron traps;Integrated circuit reliability;Lead compounds;Leakage current;Performance analysis;Random variables;Temperature;Voltage","","","","10","","16","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"FastRoute3.0: A fast and high quality global router based on virtual capacity","Yanheng Zhang; Yue Xu; Chu, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","344","349","As an easily implemented approach, ripup and reroute has been employed by most of todaypsilas global routers, which iteratively applies maze routing to refine solution quality. But traditional maze routing is susceptible to get stuck at local optimal results. In this work, we will present a fast and high quality global router FastRoute3.0, with the new technique named virtual capacity. Virtual capacity is proposed to guide the global router at maze routing stage to achieve higher quality results in terms of overflow and runtime. During maze routing stage, virtual capacity works as a substitute for the real edge capacity in calculating the maze routing cost. There are two sub techniques included: (1) virtual capacity initialization, (2) virtual capacity update. Before the maze routing stage, FastRoute3.0 initializes the virtual capacity by subtracting the predicted overflow generated by adaptive congestion estimation (ACE) from the real edge capacity. And in the following maze routing iterations, we further reduce the virtual capacity by the amount of existing overflow(edge usage minus real edge capacity) for the edges that are still congested. To avoid excessive ldquopushing-awayrdquo of routing wires, the virtual capacity is increased by a fixed percentage of the existing overflow if edge usage is smaller than real edge capacity. Experimental results show that FastRoute3.0 is highly proficient dealing with ISPD98, ISPD07 and ISPD08 benchmark suites. The results outperform published ripup and reroute based academic global routers in both routability and runtime. In particular, (1) FastRoute3.0 completes routing all the ISPD98 benchmarks. (2) For ISPD07 and ISPD08 global routing contest benchmarks, it generates 12 out of 16 congestion free solutions. (3) The total runtime is enhanced greatly.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681596","","Circuits;Cost function;Iterative methods;Routing;Runtime;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;benchmark testing;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit design;network routing","ISPD07 benchmark;ISPD08 benchmark;ISPD98 benchmark;VLSI design;adaptive congestion estimation;global router FastRoute3.0;maze routing stage;real edge capacity;virtual capacity","","11","","15","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We call our approach Pyramids, since it uses pyramid-shaped delay surfaces to solve for the optimal location, rather than running a more expensive linear programming solver. We show how to apply these techniques to timing-driven detailed placement and also for more accurate late-stage incremental timing correction. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Pyramids by showing significantly improved timing after an industrial placement algorithm.

The basic idea is to build and solve a group of four quadratic equations in four variables iteratively, which can handle the fixed-outline constraint of any aspect ratio. A new topological representation called Ordered Quadtree is then custom-made for this basic idea to facilitate its integration into SA iterations. After the fixed-outline constraint with 100% area utilization is achieved, we will solve the tradeoff between the chip area and wirelength and thus concentrate on the latter in SA process. Experimental results show that the chip wirelength is decreased by about 16.8% and 8.6% on average, compared with two previous fixed-outline floorplanners on soft modules, which are both proved to be better than Parquet. Besides, our method is still competitive on the wirelength, even if compared with some leading-edge outline-free floorplanners. At last, Local Refinement is also adopted to guide the SA process and reshape soft modules to meet the constraint on their aspect ratios (ARs).

Multiple Supply Voltage (MSV) design is introduced to provide higher flexibility in controlling the power and performance trade-off. One important requirement of MSV design is that timing constraints of the circuit must be satisfied after voltage assignment of the cells. In this paper, we will show that the voltage assignment task on a given netlist can be formulated as a convex cost dual network flow problem and can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a cost-scaling algorithm when the delay choices of each module are continuous in the real or integer domain. We can make use of this approach to obtain a feasible voltage assignment solution in the general cases with power consumption approximating the minimum one. Furthermore, we will propose a framework to optimize power consumption and physical layout of a circuit simultaneously during the floorplanning stage, by embedding this cost-scaling solver into a simulated annealing based floorplanner. This is effective in practice due to the short running time of the solver. We compared our approach with the latest work [9] on the same problem, and the experimental results show that, using our framework, significant improvement on power saving (18% less power cost on average) can be achieved in much less running time (7times faster on average) for all the test cases, which confirms the effectiveness of our approach.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681544","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Delay effects;Energy consumption;Polynomials;Simulated annealing;Timing;Voltage control","circuit layout;power consumption;simulated annealing;timing","convex cost dual network flow problem;cost-scaling algorithm;floorplanning stage;multiple supply voltage;network flow-based power optimization;power consumption;power saving;simulated annealing;timing constraints","","9","","18","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circuit transforms we employ include, but are not limited to, incremental placement, two types of buffer insertion, cell resizing and cell replication. The problem is modeled as a min-cost network flow problem, in which nodes represent circuit transform options. By carefully determining the structure of the network graph and the cost of each arc, a set of near-optimal transform options can be obtained as those whose corresponding nodes in the network graph have the min-cost flow passing through them. We also tie the transform selection network graph to a detailed placement network graph with TD arc costs for cell movements. This enables our algorithms to incorporate considerations of detailed placement cost for each synthesis transform along with the basic cost of applying the transform in the circuit. We have tested our algorithms on three sets of benchmarks under 3-10% area increase constraints, and obtained up to 48% and an average of 27.8% timing improvement. Our average improvement is relatively 40% better (8.2% better by an absolute measure) than applying the same set of transforms in a good sequential order that is used in many current techniques.

Most of the state-of-the-art academic global routers just work on a simplified routing congestion model that ignores the essential via capacity for routing through multiple metal layers. Such a simplified model would easily cause fatal routability problems in subsequent detailed routing. To remedy this deficiency, we present in this paper a more effective congestion metric that considers both the in-tile nets and the residual via capacity for global routing. With this congestion metric, we develop a new global router that features two novel routing algorithms for congestion optimization, namely least-flexibility-first routing and multi-source multi-sink escaping-point routing. The least-flexibility-first routing processes the nets with the least flexibility first, facilitating a quick prediction of congestion hot spots for the subsequent nets. Enjoying lower time complexity than traditional maze and A*-search routing, in particular, the linear-time escaping-point routing guarantees to find the optimal solution and achieves the theoretical lower-bound time complexity. Experimental results show that our global router can achieve very high-quality routing solutions with more reasonable via usage, which can benefit and correctly guide subsequent detailed routing.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681597","","Circuit synthesis;Degradation;Design engineering;Design for manufacture;Large-scale systems;Manufacturing;Routing;Tiles;Transistors;Wire","circuit optimisation;network routing","A*-search routing;congestion metric;in-tile nets;large-scale circuit designs;least-flexibility-first routing;multi-layer global routing;multi-source multi-sink escaping-point routing;optimization;via-and-wire capacities","","10","","17","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","112","115","As VLSI technology enters the nanoscale regime, interconnect delay becomes the bottleneck of circuit performance. Compared to gate delays, wires are becoming increasingly resistive which makes it more difficult to propagate signals across the chip. However, more advanced technologies (65 nm and 45 nm) provide relief as the number of metal layers continues to increase. The wires on the upper metal layers are much less resistive and can be used to drive further and faster than on thin metals. This provides an entirely new dimension to the traditional wire sizing problem, namely, layer assignment for efficient timing closure. Assigning all wires to thick metals improves timing, however, routability of the design may be hurt. The challenge is to assign minimal amount of wires to thick metals to meet timing constraints. In this paper, the minimum cost layer assignment problem is proven to be NP-Complete. As a theoretical solution for NP-complete problems, a polynomial time approximation scheme is proposed. The new algorithm can approximate the optimal layer assignment solution by a factor of 1 + isin in O(mlog logm <b>ldr</b> n<sup>3</sup>/isin<sup>2</sup>) time for 0 < isin < 1, where n is the number of nodes in the tree and m is the number of routing layers. This work presents the first theoretical advance for the timing-driven minimum cost layer assignment problem. In addition to its theoretical guarantee, the new algorithm is highly practical. Our experiments on 500 test cases demonstrate that the new algorithm can run 2times faster than the optimal dynamic programming algorithm with only 2% additional wire.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681560","","Circuit optimization;Costs;Integrated circuit interconnections;NP-complete problem;Polynomials;Propagation delay;Routing;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;polynomial approximation","VLSI technology;interconnect delay;nanoscale regime;polynomial time approximation scheme;routing layers;timing-driven minimum cost layer assignment problem;upper metal layers;wire sizing problem","","2","","15","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a dynamic thermal-aware reliability management (DTRM) framework to analyze the impact of temperature variations on the longterm/lifetime reliability of Platform FPGAs. We first study the temperature variations, both across and with-in designs, due to the use of various hard-blocks within a 65 nm platform FPGA. In the presence of such variations, we demonstrate the vulnerability of Platform FPGAs to two different hard-failures, namely, Electromigration, and time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB).

Despite simplicity of the solution statement, it is not easily considered because it requires changes in RTL, which, in turn, exacerbates the verification problem. We offer a timing closure solution guaranteed to preserve functional correctness of designs expressed using atomic actions or rules. We exploit the fact that the semantics of atomic actions are untimed, that is, the time to execute an action is not specified. The current hardware synthesis technique from atomic actions assumes that each rule takes one clock cycle to complete its computation. Consequently, the rule with the longest combinational path determines the clock cycle of the entire design, often leading to needlessly slow circuits. We present a synthesis procedure for a system where the combinational circuits embodied in a rule can take multiple cycles without changing the semantics of the original design. We also present preliminary results based on an experimental compiler which uses the Bluespec (BSV) compiler front end and generates Verilog. The results show that the clock speed and the performance of circuits can be improved substantially by allowing slow paths to complete over multiple cycles. Our technique is orthogonal to solutions based on multiple clock domains.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681547","","Artificial intelligence;Central Processing Unit;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Computer science;Delay estimation;Hardware design languages;Scheduling algorithm;Timing","combinational circuits;network synthesis;scheduling;timing circuits","clock cycle;combinational circuits;multi-cycle atomic actions;timing closure problem","","5","","14","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes the texture mapping subsystem an attractive candidate for energy optimization. We argue that a standard cache hierarchy, commonly used by researchers and commercial graphics processors for texture mapping, is wasteful of energy, and propose the Texture Filter Memory, an energy efficient architecture that exploits locality and the relatively high degree of predictability in texture memory access patterns.

Pessimism in noise analysis can lead to significant additional time spent addressing false violations. Taking logic correlation into consideration, noise analysis can reduce pessimism significantly by eliminating false noise signals [1]-[3][5]-[7][10]-[13]. Eliminating the aggressors from the aggressor candidate set that can not switch simultaneously restricted by the logic exclusivity (LE) relationship among them can save simulation time as well. The LE problem, being proved as NP-complete, is basically to determine the subset (possibly multiple equivalent subsets) of a given aggressor candidate set which has the largest combined weight out of all possible subsets governed by logic exclusivity constraints. This paper presents a new approach in resolving the LE problem, which employs a gain guided backtrack search technique that does not require exhaustive search of all the binary paths to reach an optimal solution. We first prove that under certain conditions, if the gain at each level is non-negative, then the result will be optimal. Based on this theorem, a new algorithm is developed. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach.

By converting the design to a synchronous elastic form and then applying this extended set of transformations, one can pipeline a functional specification with an automatically generated distributed controller that implements stalling logic resolving data hazards off the critical path of the design.

While the availability of increasing parallel computing power holds new promise to address many computing challenges in CAD, the leverage of hardware parallelism can only be possible with a new generation of parallel CAD applications. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-algorithm parallel circuit simulation approach (MAPS) and its multi-core implementation to expedite one of the most fundamental CAD applications: transistor-level transient circuit simulation. MAPS starts multiple simulation algorithms in parallel for a given simulation task. By properly synchronizing these algorithms on-the-fly, we exploit the diversity in simulation algorithms to achieve possibly superlinear overall speedup in transient simulation. In addition, our unique multi-algorithm framework allows unique safe exploration of simulation methods that are conventionally discarded due to convergence concerns. As a coarse grained parallel simulation approach, the implementation of MAPS demands a minimum of parallel programming effort and allows for reuse of existing serial simulation codes.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681554","","Circuit simulation;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Convergence;Hardware;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Runtime;Supercomputers","circuit CAD;circuit simulation;parallel programming","CAD;multi-algorithm parallel circuit simulation;multi-core implementation;parallel programming;serial simulation codes;transistor-level transient circuit simulation","","15","","23","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-speed links are particularly hard to analyze because of the complex interplay of device/circuit parasitics and channel filtering operation. In this paper we introduce optimization-based framework for link design-space exploration, connecting the link transmission quality and top-level filter settings with circuit power, sizing and biasing. We derive a special analytical discrete time representation that avoids the size explosion of the symbolic problem description improving the parsing and solver time by orders of magnitude and making this joint optimization possible in real-time. This robust and accurate problem formulation is derived in signomial form and is compatible with existing optimization approaches to circuit sizing.

Yet, there is no easy way to predict the result of step 2 during step 1. In our approach, we place the primary importance on the cost of power/ground noise. Consequently, we try to minimize the cost of power/ground noise first and then to construct a clock routing tree later while satisfying the clock skew constraint. Through experimentation using several benchmark circuits, it is shown that this approach is quite effective and produces very good solutions, reducing the power/ground noise by 75% and the peak current by 26% at the expense of 5% wirelength overhead compared to that produced by the conventional approach.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681608","","Circuit noise;Clocks;Costs;Inverters;Noise generators;Noise reduction;Power generation;Power supplies;Routing;Switches","buffer circuits;clocks;network routing;trees (electrical)","benchmark circuits;clock buffer polarity assignment;clock network;clock routing tree;clock skew constraint;ground noise minimization;power noise minimization;wirelength overhead","","6","","13","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a automatic method to verify the microprocessor external interrupt behaviors on the OCB. The verification approach is based on the Processor External Interrupt Verification Tool (PEVT) whose simulation environment is direct-connected memory. In this paper, we implement the PEVT-SoC and successfully verify two SoC platforms, one academic microprocessor and one public domain microprocessor. An interesting bug appears that is impossible to be discovered in the memory bus and not easy to be identified on the OCB. The result shows that the PEVT-SoC effectively shortens the verification time regardless of the system complexity and can be easily migrated to different platforms/microprocessors.

In contrast to probabilistic (non-Monte Carlo) statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) techniques, which are typically derived from simple statistical or timing models, the MC-based SSTA technique encompasses complicated timing and process variation models. However, a precise analysis that involves a traditional MC-based technique requires many timing simulation runs (1000s). In this paper, the behavior of the critical delay of digital circuits is investigated by using a Legendre polynomial-based ANOVA decomposition. The analysis verifies that the variance of the critical delay is mainly due to the pairwise interactions among the principal components (PCs) of the process parameters. Based on this fact, recent progress on the MC-based SSTA, through Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), is also studied. It is shown that this technique is prone to inefficient critical delay variance and quantile estimating. Inspired by the decomposition observations, an efficient algorithm is proposed which produces optimally low L2-discrepancy quasi-MC (QMC) samples which significantly improve the precision of critical delay statistical estimations, compared with that of the MC, LHS, and traditional QMC techniques.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681574","","Analysis of variance;Analytical models;Circuit analysis;Circuit simulation;Delay estimation;Digital circuits;Personal communication networks;Polynomials;Statistical analysis;Timing","Legendre polynomials;Monte Carlo methods;VLSI;decomposition;digital circuits;principal component analysis","Latin hypercube sampling;Legendre polynomial-based ANOVA decomposition;Monte Carlo-based statistical static timing analysis;critical delay statistical estimation;digital VLSI circuits;principal components;process variation models;timing models","","8","","29","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By exploiting the low effective threshold voltage and zero leakage achievable with these relays, we show that NEM relay-based adders can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in energy efficiency over CMOS adders with ns-range delays and with no area penalty. By applying parallelism, this improvement in energy-efficiency can be achieved at higher throughputs as well, at the cost of increased area.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","292","296","This paper describes an alternate method to Monte Carlo for calculating circuit node voltage and branch current variances due to random process variability. Recent results show that the complex models traditionally used to describe random process variations of a transistor can be replaced by a single independent current noise source with a variance dependent on the transistorpsilas size and operating points. As a result, each transistor affected by random process variability can be modeled as a deterministic device in parallel with a current noise source. By replacing all the transistors in a circuit with this model, the spatial voltage variances of circuit nodes can be calculated through linear small-signal analysis. The idea is presented in this paper and a tool implemented for Berkeley SPICE is described. The results of the variability SPICE tool match the results from Monte Carlo run in SPECTRE, with an accuracy determined by the accuracy of the random process variability model. For example, the standard deviations computed by the tool are within a 5.0% accuracy of those calculated through measured silicon data which has a fitting error of 5.4%. The Monte Carlo method computes node variances in a time proportional to the number of circuit nodes and the number of iterations, whereas the computation time required by the variability tool is only a function of the number of circuit nodes. For large analog designs this results in a significant speed-up in the amount of time required to calculate circuit node variances.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681588","","Analysis of variance;Circuit noise;Circuit simulation;Differential amplifiers;Integrated circuit noise;Monte Carlo methods;Random processes;SPICE;Silicon;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;SPICE;integrated circuit design;random processes","Monte Carlo;SPICE;linear analysis;linear small-signal analysis;random process variability","","3","","11","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several efficient techniques for solving the proposed system of constraints are presented, including an optimization problem formulation for finding the optimal stabilizing projection, and a formulation with computational complexity independent of the size of the original system. The resulting algorithms can create accurate stable and passive models of arbitrary indefinite systems at a significantly cheaper cost than existing methods such as balanced truncation. Nevertheless, our algorithms integrate fully and effortlessly with most of the available standard model order reduction approaches for very large systems generated in VLSI applications (such as moment-matching methods, POD, or poor manpsilas TBR), which can guarantee stability and passivity only in very specialized cases. Our algorithms have been tested on a large variety of typical VLSI applications, including field-solver-extracted models of RF inductors for analog applications, power distribution grids for large VLSI digital integrated circuits, and MEMS devices for sensing and actuation applications.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","85","92","Previous model order reduction methods fit into the framework of identifying the low-order linear subspace and using the linear projection to project the full state space into the low-order subspace. Despite its simplicity, the macromodel might automatically include redundancies. In this paper, we present a model order reduction approach, named maniMOR, which extends the linear projection framework to a general nonlinear projection framework. The two key ideas of maniMOR are (1) it explicitly separates the construction of the low-order subspace and projection operation; (2) it constructs a nonlinear manifold which captures important system responses and defines the corresponding nonlinear projection operator. The low-order manifold subspace in maniMOR is identified by stitching together the low-order linear subspaces around a set of sample points on the manifold. After the manifold is determined, it is embedded into a global nonlinear coordinate system. The projection function is defined in a piece-wise linear manner, and the model evaluation is conducted directly in the manifold subspace using cheap matrix-vector product computations. As a result, a compact model is generated by pre- computing all the functions and Jacobians and storing them in a look-up table. We apply maniMOR on two analog circuits and a bio-chemical system to validate its correctness. Extensive comparisons with the results of the full model and other macromodels are provided. Experimental results show that maniMOR manages to obtain a huge reduction - e.g., from 52 to 5 for the I/O buffer circuit and from 304 to 30 for yeast pheromone pathway system. This is less than half of the size of the TPWL model with the same accuracy.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","286","291","Non-ideal pattern transfer from drawn circuit layout to manufactured nanometer transistors can severely affect electrical characteristics such as drive current, leakage current, and threshold voltage. Obtaining accurate electrical models of non-rectangular transistors due to sub-wavelength lithography effects is indispensable for DFM-aware nanometer IC design. In this paper, TCAD device simulations are utilized to quantify the accuracy of a standard equivalent gate length extraction approach for non-rectangular transistors. It is verified that threshold voltage and current density are non-uniform along the channel width due to narrow-width related edge effects, leading to significant inaccuracy in the sub-threshold region.

As technology scales further, the increase in transistor integration capacity also leads to the increase in process and environmental variations. Despite these difficulties, it is expected that systems remain reliable while delivering the required performance. Reliability and variability are emerging as new design challenges, thus pointing to the importance of modeling and analysis of transient faults and variation sources for the purpose of guiding the design process. This work presents a symbolic approach to modeling the effect of transient faults in digital circuits in the presence of variability due to process manufacturing. The results show that using a nominal case and not including variability effects, can underestimate the SER by 5% for the 50% yield point and by 10% for the 90% yield point.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681651","","Circuit faults;Electromagnetic transients;Error analysis;Logic circuits;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Propagation delay;Semiconductor process modeling;Transient analysis;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;electric breakdown;integrated circuit reliability;monolithic integrated circuits","Monte Carlo simulation;chip level gate oxide breakdown analysis;die-to-die components;distinct random variable;full-chip gate-oxide reliability analysis;integrated circuit;transformation;within-die components","","3","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first compute the solution for steady-state thermal conditions by solving a linear program. We then present two approaches to computing the transient speed curves for each core: (i) a local solution, which involves solving a linear program every time step (of about 10 ms), and (ii) a global solution, which computes the optimal speed curve over a large time window (of about 100 s) by solving a non-linear program. We showed that the local solution is insensitive to the weights assigned in the performance objective (hence the need for the global solution). This is because a reduction in the speed of a core can only reduce the temperature of the other cores over much larger time periods (of the order of several seconds). The local solution is then completely determined by the temperature constraint equations. We show that the constraint matrix exhibits a special property - it can be expressed as the sum of a diagonal matrix and a matrix with identical rows. This allows us to solve the multi-core thermal constraint equations analytically to determine the (temporally) local optimum speeds. Further, we showed that due to this property, the steady-state speed solution selects a set of threads to operate at maximum temperature, and turns off all unused cores. Hence, to ensure that all available threads are scheduled, we impose a ldquofairnessrdquo constraint. Finally, we show how the open-loop speed control methods proposed above could be used together with a feedback controller to achieve robustness to model uncertainty.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681627","","Adaptive control;Equations;Multicore processing;Robust control;Steady-state;Temperature;Throughput;Upper bound;Velocity control;Yarn","microprocessor chips;open loop systems","feedback controller;linear program;local solution;multicore thermal constraint equations;open-loop speed control methods;steady-state speed solution;temperature constraint equations;thermally constrained multicore processors;transient speed curves","","16","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The global routing assigns each block port to a unique bump pad via an I/O pad and decides the RDL routing among I/O pads and bump pads. Based on the minimum-cost maximum-flow algorithm, we can guarantee 100% RDL routing completion after the assignment and the optimal solution with the minimum wirelength. The RDL routing efficiently distributes the routing points between two adjacent bump pads and then generates a 100% routable sequence to complete the routing.

We propose a simulated-annealing based placement algorithm that produces placements with the objective of maximizing the chances of successful recovery from faults in logic elements within the circuitpsilas timing constraints. In addition, our study of the fault reconfiguration problem shows it is NP-Complete, and we propose a fast scheme for achieving a good reconfiguration solution for a random or clustered fault map.

But, pulsed latch-based design using a single pulse width has a limitation in reducing clock period. The limitation still exists even if clock skew scheduling is employed, since the amount of skew that can be assigned is practically limited due to process variations. The problem of allocating pulse width (out of discrete number of predefined widths) and scheduling clock skew (within prescribed upper bound) is formulated, for the first time, for optimizing pulsed latch-based sequential circuits. An allocation algorithm called PWCS_Optimize is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments with 65-nm technology demonstrate that small number of variety of pulse widths (up to 5) combined with clock skews (up to 10% of clock period) yield minimum clock period for many benchmark circuits. The design flow including PWCS_Optimize, placement and routing, and synthesis of local and global clock trees is presented and assessed with example circuits.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681578","","Clocks;Design optimization;Flip-flops;Latches;Pulse circuits;Routing;Sequential circuits;Space vector pulse width modulation;Timing;Upper bound","benchmark testing;clocks;flip-flops;sequential circuits","allocation algorithm;benchmark circuits;clock skew scheduling;design flow;flip-flops;global clock trees;local clock trees;pulse width allocation;pulsed latches;routing;sequential circuits","","1","","13","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A limitation of many recent variability-aware timing analysis techniques is that, while they report delay distributions, or verify multiple corners, they do not provide the required guidance for re-design. We propose an efficient block-based parameterized timing analysis technique that can accurately capture circuit delay at every point in the parameter space, by reporting all paths that can become critical. Using an efficient pruning algorithm, only those potentially critical paths are carried forward, while all other paths are discarded during propagation. This allows one to examine local robustness to parameters in different regions of the parameter space, not by considering differential sensitivity at a point (which would be useless in this context) but by knowledge of the paths that can become critical at nearby points in parameter space. We give a formal definition of this problem and propose a technique for solving it that improves on the state of the art, both in terms of theoretical computational complexity and in terms of run time on various test circuits.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681570","","Circuit testing;Clocks;Computational complexity;Delay estimation;Land surface temperature;Random variables;Robustness;Signal processing;Timing;Voltage","computational complexity;critical path analysis;delays;network analysis;timing","circuit delay;computational complexity;delay distributions;efficient block-based parameterized timing analysis;potentially critical paths;variability-aware timing analysis","","6","1","10","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes such an algorithm based on the wellknown method of floating random walk (FRW). Specifically, we formalize the notion of random path sharing between several conductors undergoing shape perturbations and use it as a basis of a fast capacitance sensitivity extraction algorithm and a fast incremental variational capacitance extraction algorithm. The efficiency of these algorithms is further improved with a novel FRW method for dealing with layered media.

The new shared source/ drain technique improves critical path delay by 11% on average over a number of benchmarks for only a ~35% increase in leakage. Furthermore, stress-enhanced standard cell libraries offer a superior power/ delay tradeoff compared to dual-V<sub>th</sub> across a wide range of operating points with reduced manufacturing costs.

Using the insights gained from rigorous nonlinear system theory, we define the much needed SRAM dynamic noise margins (DNMs). The newly defined DNMs not only capture key SRAM nonlinear dynamical characteristics but also provide valuable design insights. Furthermore, we show how system theory can be exploited to develop CAD algorithms that can analyze SRAM dynamic stability characteristics three orders of magnitude faster than a brute-force approach while maintaining SPICE-level accuracy. We also demonstrate a parametric dynamic stability analysis approach suitable for low-probability cell failures, leading to three orders of magnitude runtime speedup for yield analysis under high-sigma parameter variations.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681601","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit noise;Circuit stability;Design automation;Failure analysis;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Random access memory;Runtime;Stability analysis","CAD;SPICE;SRAM chips;noise;nonlinear dynamical systems;stability","CAD;SPICE;SRAM;dynamic read-write-assist circuits;nonlinear cell dynamics;nonlinear system theory;parametric dynamic stability;static noise margins","","14","","19","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decoupling capacitor (decap) allocation is one of the most effective way in reducing serious dynamic power noises (hotspots). To allocate decap before placement, we observed that not only locations but also rising time of functional cells are required to accurately predict power noises. Compared to a previous work which only takes neighborhood relation into consideration, our method is more efficient in reducing hotspots. Furthermore, to reduce the hotspots after placement, instead of only using the empty space as proposed in the previous work, we move out cells in the area with serious power noise area (hot area). The obtained empty space can be used to accommodate decaps to further reduce the hotspots. The experimental result shows, compared to the previous work [1], our estimation function to allocate decap before placement is 23% better in reducing power noises. Moreover, compared to a method which fills decaps to all remaining empty space, our cell move algorithm can almost eliminate all the remaining hot grid nodes and hot cells. In summary, compared to the original circuits (without decap), about 60% of hotspots can be removed using our prediction function before placement, and most of the remaining hotspots are removed by our cell moving step after placement.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681610","","Capacitors;Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Clocks;Computer science;Degradation;Dynamic voltage scaling;Integrated circuit noise;Noise reduction;Power supplies","VLSI;capacitors;integrated circuit design;power supply circuits","VLSI design;estimation function;hot cells;hot grid nodes;integrated circuit;power noise reduction;prediction function;transition-aware decoupling-capacitor allocation","","1","","11","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that choosing which blocks to migrate and their placement in a floorplan is a chicken-and-egg problem. To solve this, we propose a two step floorplanning methodology, wherein, given a base floorplan, we first choose the modules to replicate and then effectively utilize the deadspaces in it by exploiting the lateral conduction of heat in the floorplan to place a modulepsilas replica. With an optimized floorplan, using task migration we obtain an average savings of 29% in the active sub-threshold leakage at the expense of about 6% additional area.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681590","","Circuits;Disaster management;Silicon;Subthreshold current;Temperature dependence;Temperature sensors;Thermal engineering;Thermal management;Threshold voltage;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;transistors","CMOS;active sub-threshold leakage reduction;chicken-and-egg problem;hot module design;low transistor threshold voltage;on-chip temperature;task migration;thermal-aware floorplanning","","3","","16","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a novel memory model for design debugging is presented. It models memory succinctly by avoiding an explicit representation for each memory bit. The method uses the simulation of the erroneous design to guide the debugging process. This results in a parameterizable formal encoding that grows linearly with the erroneous trace length, significantly reducing the memory requirements of the debugging problem. In addition, the proposed model is extended to handle an arbitrary initial memory configuration, as well as non-cycle accurate output traces where only a final expected memory state is available for comparison.

In this paper, we propose task sequencing as a powerful and complimentary mechanism to voltage scaling in improving the thermal profile of an embedded system executing a set of periodic heterogenous tasks under timing constraints. We first derive the peak temperature of a repeating task sequence analytically and develop a heuristic to construct the task sequence that minimizes the peak temperature. Experimental evaluation shows that our task sequencing heuristic achieves peak temperature within 0.5degC of the optimal solution and 7.47degC lower, on an average, compared to the worst sequence for a large range of embedded task sets. We also propose an iterative algorithm that combines task sequencing with voltage scaling to further lower the peak temperature while satisfying the timing constraints. For embedded task sets, our combined task sequencing and voltage scaling approach achieves, on an average, 2.1degC - 6.94degC reduction in peak temperature compared to voltage scaling alone.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681641","","Cooling;Costs;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Packaging;Power system management;Temperature;Thermal management;Timing;Voltage","power aware computing;thermal management (packaging)","on-chip power density;temperature aware task sequencing;voltage scaling","","15","","22","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its performance does not depend on the routing grid size of the input while routers do. This is a big advantage because modern PCB routing configurations usually imply huge routing grids. The novelty of this work is that we view the length-matching routing problem as an area assignment problem and use a placement structure, Bounded-Sliceline Grid (BSG), to help solving the problem. Experimental results show that our router can handle practical designs that previous routers canpsilat handle. For designs that they could handle, our router runs much faster.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20081118","2008","","","603","610","Thermal analysis has long been essential for designing reliable, high-performance, cost-effective integrated circuits (ICs). Increasing power densities are making this problem more important. Characterizing the thermal profile of an IC quickly enough to allow feedback on the thermal effects of tentative design changes is a daunting problem, and its complexity is increasing. The move to nanoscale fabrication processes is increasing the importance of quantum thermal phenomena such as ballistic phonon transport. Accurate thermal analysis of nanoscale ICs containing hundreds of millions of devices requires characterization of thermal effects on length scales that vary by several orders of magnitude, from nanoscale quantum thermal effects to centimeter-scale cooling package impact. Existing chip.package thermal analysis methods based on classical Fourier heat transfer cannot capture nanoscale quantum thermal effects. However, accurate device-level modeling techniques, such as molecular dynamics methods, are far too slow for use in full-chip IC thermal analysis. In this work, we propose and develop ThermalScope, a multi-scale thermal analysis method for nanoscale IC design. It unifies microscopic and macroscopic thermal physics modeling methods, i.e., the Fourier and Boltzmann transport modeling methods. Moreover, it supports adaptive multi-resolution modeling. Together, these ideas enable efficient and accurate characterization of nanoscale quantum heat transport as well as chip.package level heat flow. ThermalScope is designed for full-chip thermal analysis of billion-transistor nanoscale IC designs, with accuracy at the scale of individual devices.

In this paper, we present an efficient modeling of timing variation with overlay which is inevitable for DPT. Our work makes it possible to analyze timing with overlay variables. Since the variation of metal space caused by overlay results in coupling capacitance variation, we first model metal spacing variation with individual overlay sources. Then, all overlay sources are considered to determine the worst timing with coupling capacitance variation. Non-parallel pattern caused by overlay is converted to parallel one with equivalent spacing having the same delay to be applicable of a traditional RC extraction flow. To verify our work, we use identical interconnects having different positions and different layout decompositions. Experimental result shows that the delay has a variation from 7.8% to 9.1% depending on their locations. The well decomposed structure shows only 2.7% delay variation.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681619","","Apertures;Capacitance;Conductors;Delay;Lenses;Light sources;Lithography;Shipbuilding industry;Throughput;Timing","delays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;lithography","RC extraction flow;coupling capacitance variation;delay variation;double patterning technology;lithography process;metal spacing variation modelling;nonparallel pattern;overlay aware interconnect;size 32 nm;timing variation modeling","","12","","9","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such cases, DPL requires that a layout feature be split into two parts.

We evaluate our technique on both real-world and artificially generated test cases in 45 nm technology.

This paper proposes a novel branch-and-bound algorithm that elegantly and efficiently solves the hitherto open problem of statistical path tracing. The resulting paths are used for at-speed structural testing. A new Test Quality Metric (TQM) is proposed and paths which maximize this metric are selected.

Run-time observability is a prerequisite for runtime adaptivity as it is providing necessary system information gathered on-the-fly. We are presenting the first comprehensive runtime observability infrastructure for an adaptive network on chip architecture which is flexible (e.g. in choosing the routing path), hardly intrusive, and requires little additional overhead (around 0.7% of the total link bandwidth). The hardware overhead is negligible, too, and is in fact less than the hardware savings due to resource multiplexing capabilities that are achieved through runtime observability/adaptivity. As an example, our on-demand buffer assignment scheme increases the buffer utilization and decreases the overall buffer requirements by an average of 42% (the buffer area amounts to about 60% of the entire router area [19]) in our case study analysis compared to a fixed buffer assignment scheme [7]. Our runtime observability on an average also increases the connection success rate by 62% compared to the case without runtime observability for the applications from the E3S benchmark suite [6].

The huge size renders circuit simulation inefficient and the large number of inputs further limits the application of existing Krylov-subspace macromodeling algorithms. However, strong locality has been observed that two nodes geometrically far have very small electrical impact on each other because of the exponential attenuation. However, no systematic approaches have been proposed to exploit such locality. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling and simulation scheme, which can automatically identify the dominant inputs for a given observed node in a power grid network. This enables us to build extremely compact models by projecting the system onto the locally dominant Krylov subspace corresponding to those dominant inputs only. The resulting simulation can be very fast with the compact models if we only need to view the responses of a few nodes under many different inputs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can have at least 100X speedup over SPICE-like simulations on a number of large power grid networks up to 1 M nodes.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681659","","Application specific integrated circuits;Attenuation;Circuit analysis;Filters;Microelectronics;Network-on-a-chip;Power grids;Power system modeling;System-on-a-chip;Transfer functions","SPICE;VLSI;circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;power grids","Krylov-subspace macromodeling algorithms;SPICE-like simulations;VLSI systems;circuit simulation;exponential attenuation;locally dominant Krylov subspace method;on-chip power grid network modelling","","3","","15","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key enabler is the utilization of soft-edge flip-flops to allow time borrowing between consecutive stages of the pipeline in order to provide the timing-critical stages with more time to complete their computations resulting in lower error probability. This raises the effective throughput of the pipeline for a fixed energy consumption level, or alternatively, lowers the energy consumption for the same effective throughput. We formulate the problem of optimally selecting the transparency window sizes of the soft-edge flip-flops and the frequency level of the pipeline circuit at different voltage levels so as to optimize the energy cost of the achieved throughput.

Our method synthesizes biochemical reactions that compute output quantities of molecular types as a function of input quantities, either deterministically or probabilistically. An important constraint is the timing, captured in the relative rates of the biochemical reactions: all the outputs of a given phase must be produced before the next phase can begin consuming them as inputs. To achieve this synchronization, the reaction rates must sometimes be separated by orders of magnitude: some much faster than others, some much slower. This might be costly or infeasible given a specific library of biochemical reactions. In this paper, we describe a novel mechanism for locking the computation of biochemical modules - analogous to handshaking mechanisms in asynchronous circuit design. With locking, our method synthesizes robust computation that is nearly rate independent, requiring at most two speeds (ldquofastrdquo and ldquoslowrdquo). The trade-off is with respect to the size of the solution: more reactions are needed. We characterize this trade-off for interand intra-module locking in general and for a variety of specific modules that we have designed. In particular, we discuss locking in detail for a stochastic module that implements probabilistic computation, producing different combinations of molecular types according to specified probability distributions.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681661","","Asynchronous circuits;Biology computing;Circuit synthesis;Design automation;Libraries;Logic;Proteins;Robustness;Synthetic biology;Timing","biochemistry;biocomputing;molecular biophysics;probability;stochastic processes","asynchronous circuit design;biochemical synthesis;handshaking mechanisms;intermodule locking;intramodule locking;probabilistic computation;probability distributions;stochastic module;synchronization;technology-independent logic synthesis","","4","","26","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protein crystallization experiments are typically carried out manually on multi-well plates in the laboratory. These experiments are slow, expensive, and error-prone. We present the design of a multi-well plate microfluidic biochip for protein crystallization; this biochip can transfer protein samples, prepare candidate solutions, and carry out crystallization automatically. To reduce the manufacturing cost of such devices, we present an efficient algorithm to generate a pin-assignment plan for the proposed design. The resulting biochip enables control of a large number of on-chip electrodes using only a small number of pins. Based on the pin-constrained chip design, we present an efficient shuttle-passenger-like droplet manipulation method to achieve high-throughput and defect-tolerant well loading.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681589","","Algorithm design and analysis;Amino acids;Costs;Crystallization;Design optimization;Drugs;Laboratories;Manufacturing;Microfluidics;Proteins","bioMEMS;biochemistry;crystallisation;digital integrated circuits;microfluidics;plates (structures);proteomics","amino acids;crystallization;digital microfluidic biochip;multi-well plates;on-chip electrodes;protein;shuttle-passenger-like droplet manipulation;three-dimensional arrangement","","1","5","18","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We start from the observation that interpolants can be quite effective on large verification instances. As they operate on SAT-generated refutation proofs, interpolants are very good at automatically abstract facts that are not significant for proofs. In this work, we push forward the new idea of generating abstractions without resorting to SAT proofs, and to accept (reject) abstractions whenever they (do not) fulfill given adequacy constraints. We propose an integrated approach smoothly combining the capabilities of interpolation with abstraction and over-approximation techniques, that do not directly derive from SAT refutation proofs. The driving idea of this combination is to incrementally generate, by refinement, an abstract (over-approximate) image, built up from equivalences, implications, ternary and localization abstraction, then (eventually) from SAT refutation proofs. Experimental results, derived from the verification of hard problems, show the robustness of our approach.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681563","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuits;Data structures;Engines;Explosions;Interpolation;Performance analysis;Robustness;State-space methods","approximation theory;computability;interpolation","Craig interpolants;automated abstraction technique;incremental refinement;interpolant-based model checking;over-approximation techniques;unbounded model checking","","4","","26","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in low-k1 lithography, especially at 45 nm and beyond, printing perfect polygons is practically impossible to achieve. In addition, prohibitively high mask complexity is incurred, leading to high mask cost. Given the impossibility of perfect printing, we argue that aiming to reduce the error of electrical discrepancy between the ideal and the printed contours is a more reasonable strategy. In fact, we show that contours with non-minimal EPE may result in closer match to the desired electrical performance. Towards achieving this objective, we developed a new electrically driven OPC (ED-OPC) algorithm. The tool combines lithography simulation with accurate electrical modeling of resist contours to predict the on/off current through a transistor gate. The computation of mask edge movements is cast as a linear program based on optical and electrical sensitivities. The objective is to minimize the error in saturation current between printed and target shapes. This optimization is then solved with fast runtime. The results on industrial 45 nm SOI layouts using high-NA immersion lithography models show up to a 5% improvement in accuracy of timing over conventional OPC. This is achieved at less than 26% runtime overheads, while also lowering mask complexity by up to 43%. The results confirm that better timing accuracy can be achieved despite larger edge placement error.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681617","","Accuracy;Linear programming;Lithography;Optical saturation;Optical sensors;Predictive models;Printing;Resists;Runtime;Timing","immersion lithography;linear programming;masks;proximity effect (lithography);resists;silicon-on-insulator","SOI layouts;edge placement errors;electrically driven optical proximity correction;high-NA immersion lithography models;linear programming;lithography simulation;low-k1 lithography;mask complexity;mask edge movements;resist process;saturation current;size 45 nm;timing accuracy;transistor gate","","7","1","12","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since future technologies offer the promise of being able to integrate billions of transistors on a chip, the prospects of having hundreds to thousands of processors on a single chip along with an underlying memory hierarchy and an interconnection system is entirely feasible. This paper proposes a compiler directed integrated code and data placement scheme for two-dimensional mesh based CMP architectures. The proposed approach uses a Code-Data Affinity Graph (CDAG) to represent the relationship between loop iterations and array data and then assigns the sets of loop iterations to processing cores and sets of data blocks to on-chip memories. During the mapping process, the on-chip memory capacity and load imbalance across different cores and the topology of the NoC are taken into account. In this paper, we present two variants of our approach: depth-first placement (DFP) and breadth-first placement (BFP), and compare them to three alternate code/data mapping schemes. The experimental evaluation shows that our CDAG based placement schemes are very successful in practice, achieving average performance improvements of 19.9% (DFP) and 16.8% (BFP), and average energy improvements of 29.7% (DFP) and 27.8% (BFP).","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681635","","Costs;Educational institutions;Embedded system;Memory management;Network interfaces;Network-on-a-chip;Program processors;Programming profession;Topology;Transistors","multiprocessing systems;program compilers","breadth-first placement;chip multiprocessors;code mapping;code-data affinity graph;compiler directed integrated code;data blocks;data mapping;data placement;depth-first placement;loop iterations;on-chip memories;two-dimensional mesh","","0","","21","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several key enablers including GPU-specific algorithm design, circuit topology transformation, workload partitioning, performance tuning are embodied in our GPU-accelerated hybrid multigrid algorithm, GpuHMD, and its implementation. In particular, a proper interplay between algorithm design and SIMT architecture consideration is shown to be essential to achieve good runtime performance. Different from the standard CPU based CAD development, care must be taken to balance between computing and memory access, reduce random memory access patterns and simplify flow control to achieve efficiency on the GPU platform. Extensive experiments on industrial and synthetic benchmarks have shown that the proposed GpuHMD engine can achieve 100times runtime speedup over a state-of-the-art direct solver and be more than 15times faster than the CPU based multigrid implementation. The DC analysis of a 1.6 million-node industrial power grid benchmark can be accurately solved in three seconds with less than 50 MB memory on a commodity GPU.

Leveraging these efficient analytic variability quantification techniques, we employ an optimization approach using Sequential Quadratic Programming to simultaneously determine the fixed and tunable/switchable circuit element values in an arbitrary-order canonical filter to improve the overall robustness of the filter design when statistical variations are present. The results indicate that reconfigurable filters and impedance matching networks designed using the proposed methodology meet the specified performance requirements with a 26% average absolute yield improvement over circuits designed using deterministic techniques.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681662","","Circuits;Computational complexity;Design methodology;Design optimization;Filters;Predictive models;Quadratic programming;Robustness;Sampling methods;Virtual manufacturing","band-pass filters;circuit reliability;impedance matching;passive filters;software radio","analytic variability quantification techniques;double sided implementation;first order reliability methods;impedance matching networks;reconfigurable filters;robust reconfigurable filter design;second order reliability methods;variability aware design","","3","","26","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Perhaps Moore’s law will muddle through, as it has so far, with a combination of tools, process, and design. But even if technically possible, Moore’s law is in practice driven by economics, and economics might turn against further scaling. Also, we’ve all seen how performance of single cores has topped out, despite scaling. Might this be a fundamental problem with planar technologies, prompting the need to go 3-D to get further performance increases? Or might CMOS itself give way to other technologies, allowing Moore’s law yet another respite?

We extend the algorithm by employing Lagrangian relaxation technique, which assesses the timing criticality of paths beyond a tree, to optimize the delays in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

We address two fundamental difficulties in achieving such a methodology: yield-aware pareto performance characterization at the building block level and yield-aware system-level optimization problem formulation. It is shown that our approach is not only able to effectively capture the block performance trade-offs at different yield levels, but also correctly formulate the whole system yield and efficiently perform system-level optimization in presence of process variations. Our approach extends the efficiency of hierarchical analog optimization, enjoyed for improving nominal circuit performances, to yield-aware optimization.

This has the potential to damage ICs and cause good ICs to be discarded due to temperature-induced timing faults. We first study the power impact of scan chain testing for the ISCAS89 benchmarks. We find that the scan-chain test power consumption is 1.6times higher for at-speed testing than normal operating power consumption. We conclude that if the testing frequency is less than half of the normal frequency, then the testing power consumption may in fact be lower. However, due to differences in the cooling environments, the peak die temperatures may still be higher. Second, we present an optimal formulation for minimal-duration temperature-constrained test scheduling. Our results improve on the test schedule time of the best existing algorithm by 10.8% on average for a packaged IC thermal environment. We also present an efficient heuristic that generally produces the same results as the optimal algorithm, while requiring little CPU time, even for large problem instances.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681552","","Circuit testing;Cooling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Integrated circuit testing;Multiprocessing systems;Switching circuits;System testing;Temperature;Timing","integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit testing;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","ISCAS89 benchmarks;integrated circuit temperatures;minimal-duration temperature-constrained test scheduling;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;packaged IC thermal environment;power densities;process scaling;scan chain testing;temperature-aware test scheduling;temperature-induced timing faults","","10","","21","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outcome of the analysis is not only valuable to diagnose the effect of race conditions, but can also be used to improve simulation performance dramatically. Our compiler produces a simulator that uses the race analysis information at runtime to perform partial-order reduction, thereby eliminating context switches that do not affect the result of the simulation.

The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (OARSMT) problem has become an important problem in the physical design stage of VLSI circuits. This problem has attracted a lot of attentions in research and several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem effectively. In this paper, we will present a heuristic maze routing based approach to solve this OARSMT problem. It is commonly believed that maze routing based approaches can only handle small scale problems and there is a lack of an effective multi-terminal variant to handle multi-pin nets in practice. We will show in this paper that maze routing based approaches can also handle large scale OARSMT problems effectively. Our approach is based on the searching process as in maze routing and can handle multi-pin nets very well in both solution quality, running time and memory space usage. We have compared our results with those of the previous works and can show that we can out-perform the best previous results on this problem [15] by giving an OARSMT with 2.01% less wire length on average and can make a 27.04% improvement in wire length in comparison with a lower bound of the optimal solution on average, while the running times are all very short and comparable to those in [15]. Besides, due to the flexibility of maze routing, we can handle different kinds of obstacles with different convex or concave rectilinear shapes directly without a need to partition each blockage into a set of rectangular sub-blockages, which will increase the size of the problem.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-2819-9","978-1-4244-2820-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681625","","Ant colony optimization;Circuits;Computer science;Large-scale systems;Pins;Routing;Shape;Steiner trees;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;network routing;trees (mathematics)","VLSI circuits;heuristic maze routing;multipin nets;obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree","","0","","15","","","10-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we study a new global routing problem that not only considers traditional routing objectives such as overflow and wirelength but also focuses on honoring layer directives that are usually specified for timing-critical nets to alleviate performance degrading. Based on novel extensions of an academic router, we present a new global router called GLADE for the addressed problem.
