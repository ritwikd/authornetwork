The test results show that the algorithm is robust such that the intrinsic responses remain the same regardless of the small variation in the test waveforms.

Secondly, should the channels have a uniform capacity, or is there an advantage when capacities vary from channel to channel? The key result is that the most area-efficient global routing architecture is one with uniform (or very nearly uniform) channel capacities across the entire chip in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

In this paper, we present a technique to rapidly identify state elements (hip-hops) that are either difficult to set or unsettable. This is achieved by performing test generation on certain transformed circuits to identify state elements that are not settable to specific logic values. Two applications that benefit from this identification are sequential circuit test generation and partial scan design. The knowledge of the state space is shown to be useful in creating early backtracks in deterministic test generation. Partial scan selection is also shown to benefit from the knowledge of the difficult-to-set hip-hops.

New theoretical results based on the analysis are presented which lead to significant performance improvements. The fast run time and the excellent scaling to large problems make our Boolean optimization method practical for industrial applications. Experiments show that the optimization results are comparable to those of Kunz and Pradhan (1994) while the run time is two orders of magnitude faster (average 126/spl times/ speed up).

Since domino logic is inherently noninverting, it presents a fundamental constraint of implementing logic functions without any intermediate inversions. Removal of intermediate inverters requires logic duplication for generating both the negative and positive signal phases, which results in significant area overhead. This area overhead can be substantially reduced by selecting an optimal output phase assignment, which results in a minimum logic duplication penalty for obtaining inverter-free logic. In this paper, we present this previously unaddressed problem of output phase assignment for minimum area duplication in dynamic logic synthesis.

A circuit is described in ACV as a hierarchy of modules. Each module has a structural definition as an interconnection of logic gates and other modules. Modules may also have functional descriptions, declaring the numeric encodings of the inputs and outputs, as well as specifying their functionality in terms of arithmetic expressions. Verification then proceeds recursively, proving that each module in the hierarchy having a functional description, including the top-level one, realizes its specification. The language and the verifier contain additional enhancements for overcoming some of the difficulties in applying BMD-based verification to circuits computing functions such as division and square root. ACV has successfully verified a number of circuits, implementing such functions as multiplication, division, and square root, with word sizes up to 256 bits.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569822","","Arithmetic;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Data structures;Encoding;Integrated circuit interconnections;LAN interconnection;Libraries;Logic arrays;Logic gates","Boolean functions;circuit diagrams;digital arithmetic;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic CAD;logic gates;logic testing","ACV;Boolean functions;arithmetic circuit verifier;arithmetic expressions;binary decision diagrams;division;functional descriptions;hardware description language;hierarchical verification methodology;logic gates;multiplication;multiplicative binary moment diagrams;square root;symbolic verification;word size;word-level functions","","15","7","7","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques, however, are not sufficient to completely verify the dynamic circuit families now finding favor in high-performance designs. In this paper, we describe an approach that extends static timing analysis to a high-performance dynamic CMOS logic family called self-resetting CMOS (SRCMOS). Due to the circuit structure employed in SRCMOS, designs naturally decompose into a hierarchy of gates and macros; timing analysis must address and preferably exploit this hierarchy. At the gate level, three categories of constraints on pulse timing arise from considering the effects of pulse width, overlap, and collisions. Timing analysis is performed at the macro level, by a) performing timing tests at macro boundaries and b) using macro-level delay models. We define various macro-level timing tests which ensure that fundamental gate-level timing constraints are satisfied. We extend the standard delay model to handle leading and trailing edges of signal pulses, across-chip variations, trading of signals, and slow and fast operating conditions. We have developed an SRCMOS timing analyzer based on this approach; the analyzer implemented as extensions to a standard static timing analysis program, thus facilitating its integration into an existing design system and methodology.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569415","","CMOS logic circuits;Circuit analysis;Delay;Design methodology;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Space vector pulse width modulation;Standards development;Testing;Timing","CMOS logic circuits;automatic testing;delays;formal verification;logic testing;timing","SRCMOS;collisions;digital designs;gate-level timing constraints;high-performance dynamic CMOS logic family;macro-level delay models;overlap;pulse timing;pulse width;self resetting circuits;self-resetting CMOS;signal pulses;static timing analysis;timing behavior","","15","8","11","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At various levels of abstraction, e.g., behavioral, register-transfer level and gate level, the designer simulates the design using a large number of vectors attempting to debug and verify the design. A major problem with functional simulation is the lack of good metrics and tools to evaluate the quality of a set of functional vectors. Metrics used currently are based on instruction counts and are quite simplistic. Designers are forced to use ad-hoc methods to terminate functional simulation, e.g., CPU time limitations, We propose a new metric for measuring the extent of design verification provided by a set of functional simulation vectors. This metric is universal, and can be used uniformly for all designs. Our metric computes observability information to determine whether effects of errors that are activated by the program stimuli can be observed at the circuit outputs. We provide preliminary experimental evidence that supports the validity of the proposed metric.

For data path blocks that operate on word-level data, we construct piecewise linear models that capture the variation of output glitching activity and power consumption with various word-level parameters like mean, standard deviation, spatial and temporal correlations, and glitching activity at the block's inputs. For RTL blocks that operate on data that need not have an associated word-level value, we present accurate bit-level modeling techniques for glitching activity as well as power consumption. This allows us to perform accurate power estimation for control-flow intensive circuits, where most of the power consumed is dissipated in non-arithmetic components like multiplexers, registers, vector logic operators, etc. Since the final implementation of the controller is not available during high-level design iterations, we develop techniques that estimate glitching activity at control signals using control expressions and partial delay information.

Our approach is based on sub-dividing the synchronous clocking into multiple sub-clocks with relative skew. This spreads the computation across the entire clock cycle instead of largely occurring at the beginning. Timing constraints must also be obeyed, so that no races or timing errors are introduced. We propose an exact algorithm based on integer linear programming to solve this problem. We have used our method in the design of a 5 GHz ECL encoder chip to achieve a factor of two reduction in ground bounce, as shown by HSPICE simulations.

SyPVL represents the specialization of the more general PVL algorithm, to symmetric problems. Besides the gain in efficiency over PVL, SyPVL also preserves the symmetry of the problem, and, as a consequence, can often guarantee the stability of the resulting reduced-order models. Moreover, these reduced-order models can be synthesized as actual physical circuits, thus facilitating compatibility with existing analysis tools.

This paper presents a new static switching current estimation algorithm based on the idea of ""Expected Current Distributions"" (ECDs). Unlike previous ""expected waveform"" approaches, ECDs model not only the expected value of switching current waveforms over all time, but also the variances and covariances of all waveform segments as well. This extra information allows a switching current waveform to be modeled by a random process with both first and second order ensemble statistics. This specification provides the power spectral density of the switching current and allows the use of traditional frequency domain noise analysis to simulate the behavior of the switching current in the electrical supply network. An ECD simulation procedure is described and results are presented for the ISCAS85 combinational benchmark circuits. Estimated quantities include total average and RMS VDD current, the autocorrelation function of the total VDD current waveform, and per-gate average and RMS VDD currents. The results show speedups of up to 100 x and good agreement with respect to figures obtained using dynamic logic simulation and statistical mean estimation.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569915","","Analytical models;Circuit analysis;Circuit simulation;Current distribution;Random processes;Semiconductor device modeling;Software design;Statistics;Switching circuits;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;circuit switching;current distribution","CMOS VLSI circuit switching current;CMOS circuits;VLSI design;current distributions;dynamic logic simulation;simulation software;static switching current estimation;switching current","","2","","10","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One such effect, the signal crosstalk problem, is now a serious design concern. Signals which couple electrically may not affect system behavior because of timing or function in the digital domain. If we can isolate observable coupling then we can constrain layout synthesis to eliminate them. In this paper, we find that it is possible to predict signal interaction by signal functionality alone, leading to a significant amount of robust switching isolation, independent of parasitics introduced by layout or semiconductor process. We introduce techniques to predict signal interaction using functional sensitivity analysis. In general sequential networks we find that significant switching isolation can be extracted with efficient sensitivity analysis algorithms, thus giving promise to the goal of synthesizing layout free from crosstalk effects.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569907","","Couplings;Crosstalk;Digital systems;Lead compounds;Robustness;Sensitivity analysis;Signal design;Signal processing;Signal synthesis;Timing","circuit layout CAD;crosstalk;digital systems;logic CAD;sensitivity analysis;timing","deep submicron design;digital sensitivity;digital systems;functional analysis;functional sensitivity analysis;layout synthesis;observable coupling;parasitics;robust switching isolation;semiconductor process;sequential networks;signal crosstalk problem;signal integrity;signal interaction;signal interaction prediction;switching isolation;timing","","27","2","8","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the latches that are retimed have a hardware reset value, the initial state of the circuit must also be retimed, i.e. an initial state must be derived for the retimed circuit. Previously, it has been suggested that this can be avoided if the hardware reset signals are represented explicitly. However, it was thought that this adds unnecessary area and restricts the space of possible retimings. We demonstrate that this is not the case. In addition, we show that this methodology does not require the restriction that all reset signals be asserted at the beginning of circuit operation-a restriction that was imposed by existing algorithms for determining the retimed initial state. Finally we show how our explicit reset (ER) framework enables us to retime when some latches may be driven by different hardware resets, and some others may not have any hardware resets. We also consider the case where the resets are asynchronous. We expect these solutions to the ""retimed initial state"" problem to help increase the practical applicability of retiming.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.571329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=571329","","Circuit synthesis;Combinational circuits;Computer aided software engineering;Delay;Digital circuits;Erbium;Hardware;Latches;Logic gates;Sequential circuits","circuit optimisation;delays;digital circuits;flip-flops;logic CAD;sequential circuits;timing circuits","asynchronous reset;circuit operation;delay;explicit reset circuitry;hardware reset signals;hardware reset value;latches;retiming;synchronous sequential circuit optimization","","13","6","11","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In two-phase clocking, the nonoverlapping interval of two-phase clocks provides an additional degree of freedom to improve either the clock tree cost or jitter-tolerance. We construct a two-phase jitter-tolerant useful-skew tree (JT-UST) such that the susceptibility to clock jitter and the clock tree cost is minimized. Following the Deferred-Merge Embedding (DME) framework, we use a simulated annealing approach to explore the routing topologies and embeddings.

This class of algorithms is of the ""local improvement"" type. They generate relatively high quality results for small and medium size circuits. However, as VLSI circuits become larger, these algorithms are not so effective on them as direct partitioning tools. We propose new iterative-improvement methods that select cells to move with a view to moving clusters that straddle the two subsets of a partition into one of the subsets. The new algorithms significantly improve partition quality while preserving the advantage of time efficiency. Experimental results on 25 medium to large size ACM/SIGDA benchmark circuits show up to 70% improvement over FM in cutsize, with an average of per-circuit percent improvements of about 25%, and a total cut improvement of about 35%. They also outperform the recent placement-based partitioning tool Paraboli and the spectral partitioner MELO by about 17% and 23%, respectively, with less CPU time.

Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack non-chronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search spare. In addition, by ""recording"" the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search. Finally straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large number of benchmarks, including many from the field of test pattern generation, indicate that application of the proposed conflict analysis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a large number of representative classes of SAT instances.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569607","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic test pattern generation;Benchmark testing;Business continuity;Circuit testing;Electronic design automation and methodology;Fault diagnosis;Laboratories;Logic testing;Pattern analysis","automatic testing;circuit CAD;computability;integrated circuit testing;logic testing","GRASP;backtracking search;conflict analysis procedure;generic search algorithm;integrated algorithmic framework;satisfiability;search algorithm;test pattern generation","","116","13","18","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, there are many possible partitioning solutions with the minimum cut size and the difference of their required amounts of replication can be significant. Since there is a size constraint on each component of the partitioning in practice, it is desirable to also minimize the amount of replication. In this paper, we present a network-flow based algorithm to determine an optimum replication min-cut partitioning that requires minimum replication. We show that the algorithm can be generalized to separate two given subsets of nodes and determine an optimum partitioning of the minimum possible cut size using the least possible amount of replication.

Average power savings of 47% and 49% in buses and multiplexors, respectively, are demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569540","","Capacitance;Computer architecture;Costs;Hardware;Power dissipation;Power engineering computing;Power system interconnection;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Wires","integrated circuit interconnections;logic design","behavioral-synthesis techniques;bus capacitances;interconnect;interconnect structure;low-power design;power dissipation;regularity;scheduling","","13","","17","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These crucial topics are addressed in this paper. On exploiting experience from the statistical design of analog circuits and from pattern recognition methods, efficient solutions to these problems are provided.

Starting from these limits, this paper presents can optimized traversal technique particularly oriented to the exact exploration of the state space of large machines. This is possible thanks to: temporary simplification of a finite state machine by removing some of its state elements; and a ""divide-and-conquer"" approach based on state set decomposition. An effective use of secondary memory allows us to store relevant portions of BDDs and to regularize access to memory, resulting in less page faults.

This property eliminates the need for a traversal of the product machine for the implementation and the specification. Instead, a much simpler check suffices. This check consists of first obtaining a 1-equivalence mapping between states of the two machines, and then checking that it is a bisimulation relation. The C-1-D property can be used directly on specifications for which it naturally holds a condition that has not been exploited thus far in FSM verification. We also show how this property can be enforced on arbitrary FSMs by exposing some of the latch outputs as pseudo-primary outputs during synthesis and verification. In this sense, our synthesis/verification methodology provides another point in the tradeoff curve between constraints-on-synthesis versus complexity-of-verification. Practical experiences with using this methodology have resulted in success with several examples for which it is not possible to complete verification using existing implicit state space traversal techniques.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569807","","Automata;Boolean functions;Data structures;Encoding;Formal verification;Hardware;Latches;National electric code;Sequential circuits;State-space methods","circuit testing;finite state machines;flip-flops;formal verification;logic CAD;logic testing","Complete-1-Distinguishability;FSM equivalence checking;bisimulation relation;complexity-of-verification;constraints-on-synthesis;finite state machine verification;latch outputs;specification;state space traversal","","6","1","19","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More importantly, it is very easy to obtain the analytical solutions of 2D problem in many layers such as the pure dielectric layers and the layers with parallel signal lines. Therefore, the domain that has to be analyzed numerically is minimized. This leads to the drastic reduction of the computing time and memory needs.

JiffyTune is a new circuit optimization tool that automates the tuning task. Delay, rise/fall time, area and power targets are accommodated. Each (weighted) target can be either a constraint or an objective function. Minimax optimization is supported. Transistors can be ratioed and similar structures grouped to ensure regular layouts. Bounds on transistor widths are supported. JiffyTune uses LANCELOT, a large-scale nonlinear optimization package with an augmented Lagrangian formulation. Simple bounds are handled explicitly and trust region methods are applied to minimize a composite objective function. In the inner loop of the optimization, the fast circuit simulator SPECS is used to evaluate the circuit. SPECS is unique in its ability to efficiently provide time-domain sensitivities, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization.

The use of labels avoids explicit storing of fault lists and allows efficient access to previously detected segment faults. Experimental results demonstrate several advantages of the segment delay fault model. First, the total number of faults remains manageable for small segment lengths. Second, many segments, not included in any robustly testable path fault, may have robust segment delay fault tests. Generating tests for such segments may increase the delay defect coverage.","","0-8186-7597-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.1996.569902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569902","","Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Contracts;Delay estimation;Labeling;Logic;Propagation delay;Robustness","circuit analysis computing;combinational circuits;logic testing","combinational circuit simulation;delay defect coverage;depth-first search;edge labels;labeling technique;segment delay fault model;segment numbering","","6","1","12","","","10-14 Nov. 1996","10 Nov 1996-14 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that NWSA-wd always converges to an optimal wire-sizing solution. Based on NWSA-wd and the Lagrangian relaxation technique, we obtained two algorithms NWSA-db and NWSA-md which can optimally solve the other two minimization objectives. Experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient both in terms of runtime and storage.

Moreover, at any given time, only one partition needs to be manipulated which further increases the space efficiency. In addition to showing the utility of partitioned-ROBDDs on special classes of functions, we provide automatic techniques for their construction.

An increasing application of design data reuse is widely recognized as a promising technique to master future design complexities.

This paper introduces new concepts for an integrated HDL reverse engineering tool-set and presents an implemented evaluation prototype for VHDL designs. Starting from an arbitrary collection of HDL source code files, several graphical and textual views on the design description are automatically generated.

This paper proposes a new method of analyzing coverage based on projecting a minimized control finite-state graph onto control signals for the datapath part of the design to yield a meaningful metric and provide detailed feedback about missing tests.

We apply ideas from approximation theory to reduce this complexity to O(N log N) while maintaining double-precision accuracy. The only restriction imposed by our method is that the impulse response h(t) gets ""smoother"" as t goes to infinity. Essentially all physically reasonable impulse responses have this characteristic.

The solution of this DAE represents the ""slow"" variation of these quantities, i.e., the envelope.

Yuan et al., 1997). Unfortunately, RDCs, being a global property, are often much more difficult to compute than the satisfying set of typical CTL formulas. We address this problem through the use of Approximate Reachability Don't Cares (ARDCs), computed with the algorithms developed for the VERITAS sequential synthesis package (H. ho et al., 1990; 1996). Approximate reachable states represent an upper bound on the set of true reachable states, and thus a lower bound on the set of unreachable (Don't Care) states. ARDCs can be 10X to 100X (or much more for very large circuits) cheaper to compute than RDCs, and in some cases have the same dramatic effect on CTL model checking as the real RDCs. We also discuss the application of ARDCs to the problem of exact computation of the RDCs themselves. Experiments on industrial benchmarks show that order of magnitude speedups are possible, and occur frequently. The experimental results presented strongly support our claim that ARDCs play a safe and important way out of a serious dilemma: RDCs are necessary for tractable model checking of many large circuits, but the computation of the RDCs themselves is often intractable. We include, and theoretically justify, significant extensions of the VERITAS algorithms, and show that they can be up to an order of magnitude faster, while computing a virtually identical upper bound.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742896","","Boolean functions;Circuits;Costs;Data structures;Latches;Reachability analysis;Robustness;State-space methods;Upper bound","computational complexity;formal verification;reachability analysis","ARDCs;Approximate reachable states;CTL model checking;RDCs;Reachability;VERITAS algorithms;VERITAS sequential synthesis package;exact computation;global property;tractable model checking;virtually identical upper bound","","6","","18","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This positions our algorithm as current state of the art in multilevel circuit partitioning.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742959","","Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cost function;Joining processes;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Runtime;Telecommunications;Very large scale integration","circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;graph theory","adaptive scheme;average min-cut values;benchmark circuits;coarsening/uncoarsening;edge frequency information;multilevel circuit partitioning;multilevel partitioning algorithm;multilevel partitioning approaches;uncoarsening phase","","9","","49","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introduced by Yamashita et al. in the context of FPGA synthesis [1996], they were extended later to general combinational networks. We introduce the concept of sequential SPFDs and provide an algorithm to compute them based on a partition of the state bits. The SPFDs, of each component in the partition are used to generate equivalence classes of states. We provide a formal relation between the resulting state classification and the equivalence classes produced by classical state minimization of completely specified machines. The SPFDs, associated with the state bits can be applied for re-encoding the state space. For this, we give an algorithm to re-synthesize the sequential circuit using sequential SPFDs and the new state re-encoding.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968602","","Automata;Cows;Explosions;Field programmable gate arrays;Minimization;Network synthesis;Observability;Partitioning algorithms;Sequential circuits;State-space methods","Boolean functions;formal verification;logic CAD;logic partitioning;sequential circuits;state-space methods","Boolean networks;equivalence classes;formal relation;partition;sequential SPFDs;sequential circuit;sets of pairs of functions to be distinguished;state bits;state classification;state space re-encoding","","3","1","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Solving the Minimum-Cost Satisfiability Problem Using SAT Based Branch-and-Bound Search","Zhaohui Fu; Malik, S.","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Princeton Univ., NJ","Computer-Aided Design, 2006. ICCAD '06. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","852","859","Boolean satisfiability (SAT) has seen many successful applications in various fields, such as electronic design automation (EDA) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, in some cases it may be required/preferable to use variations of the general SAT problem. In this paper we consider one important variation, the minimum-cost satisfiability problem (MinCostSAT). MinCostSAT is a SAT problem which minimizes the cost of the satisfying assignment. MinCostSAT has various applications, e.g. automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), FPGA routing, AI planning, etc. This problem has been tackled before - first by covering algorithms, e.g. scherzo (Coudert, 1996), and more recently by SAT based algorithms, e.g. bsolo (Manquinho and Marques-Silva, 2002). However the SAT algorithms they are based on are not the current generation of highly efficient solvers. The solvers in this generation, e.g. Chaff (Moskewicz et al., 2001), MiniSat (Een and Sorensson, 2006) etc., incorporate several new advances, e.g. two literal watching based Boolean Constraint Propagation, that have delivered order of magnitude speedups. We first point out the challenges in using this class of solvers for the MinCostSAT problem and then present techniques to overcome these challenges. The resulting solver MinCostChaff shows order of magnitude improvement over several current best known branch-and-bound solvers for a large class of problems, ranging from minimum test pattern generation, bounded model checking in EDA to graph coloring and planning in AI","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110137","Boolean Satisfiability;Branch-and-Bound;MinCostSAT","Artificial intelligence;Automatic test pattern generation;Business continuity;Costs;Counting circuits;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Permission;Test pattern generators","computability;constraint handling;tree searching","Boolean constraint propagation;Boolean satisfiability;SAT based branch-and-bound search;minimum-cost satisfiability problem","","4","2","21","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

(1996) introduced a new category for expressing the flexibility that a node can have in a multi level network. Originally presented in the context of FPGA synthesis, the paper has wider implications which were discussed by R.K. Brayton (1997). SPFDs are essentially a set of incompletely specified functions. The increased flexibility that they offer is obtained by allowing both a node to change as well as its immediate fanins. The challenge with SPFDs is: (1) to compute them in an efficient way, and (2) to use their increased flexibility in a controlled way to optimize a circuit. We provide a complete implementation of SPFDs using BDDs and apply it to the optimization of Boolean networks. Two scenarios are presented, one which trades literals for wires and the other rewires the network by replacing one fanin at a node by a new fanin. Results on benchmark circuits are very favorable.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742858","","Binary decision diagrams;Bipartite graph;Boolean functions;Computer networks;Input variables;Intelligent networks;Virtual manufacturing;Wire","Boolean functions;binary decision diagrams;logic CAD","BDDs;Boolean networks;FPGA synthesis;SPFDs;Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished;benchmark circuits;immediate fanins;incompletely specified functions;multi level network;optimizing Boolean networks","","16","3","5","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
