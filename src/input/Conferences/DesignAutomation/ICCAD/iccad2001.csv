Computational results and performance data are presented for a nonlinear circuit and a micromachined fixed-fixed beam example. These examples demonstrate that the macromodels obtained with the proposed reduction algorithm are significantly more accurate than models obtained with linear or the recently developed quadratic reduction techniques.

This is significant since, with the exception of full analog simulation, no other technique attempts to model the delay effects of bridge defects.

However, experimental results presented on benchmark circuits show that the procedure identifies nearly all the redundant faults in most of the benchmark circuits. The key features of REDI that make it efficient are: partial path sensitization, blockage learning, dynamic branch ordering and fault grouping.

To ensure the design quality of power delivery, extensive transient power grid simulations need to be performed during design process. However, the traditional circuit simulation engines are not scaled as well as the complexity of power delivery, as a result, it often takes a long runtime and huge memory requirement to simulate a medium size power grid circuit. We develop and present a new efficient transient simulation algorithm for power distribution. The proposed algorithm, TLM-ADI (transmission-line-modeling alternatingdirection-implicit), first models the power delivery structure as transmission line mesh structure, then solves the transient MNA matrices by the alternating-direction-implicit method. The proposed algorithm, with linear runtime and memory requirement, is also unconditionally stable which ensures that the time-step is not limited by any stability requirement. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than SPICE but also extremely accurate.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968601","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Engines;Frequency;Power distribution;Power grids;Power system transients;Process design;Robustness;Runtime","VLSI;circuit simulation;circuit stability;finite difference methods;integrated circuit modelling;transient analysis;transmission line theory","TLM-ADI;VLSI;circuit simulation;clocking frequency;integration density;linear time;memory requirement;power delivery;power grid transient simulation;transient MNA matrices;transmission line mesh structure;transmission-line-modeling alternating-direction-implicit method;unconditionally stable design","","12","4","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new decision heuristic based on separator-set induced partitioning of the underlying CNF graph. It targets those variables whose choice generates clause partitions with disjoint variable supports. This can potentially improve performance of SAT applications by decomposing the problem dynamically within the search. In the context of a recently proposed image computation method combining SAT and BDDs, this results in simpler BDD subproblems. We provide algorithms for CNF partitioning - one based on a clause-variable dependency matrix, and another based on standard hypergraph partitioning techniques, and also for the use of partitioning information in decision heuristics for SAT. The effectiveness of the proposed partition-based heuristic is shown with practical results for reachability analysis of benchmark sequential circuits.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968635","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Data structures;National electric code;Particle separators;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Reachability analysis;Sequential circuits;Zinc","Boolean functions;binary decision diagrams;computability;formal verification;graph theory;logic CAD;logic partitioning;reachability analysis;sequential circuits","BDDs;Boolean satisfiability;CNF graph;SAT;benchmark sequential circuits;clause partitions;clause-variable dependency matrix;conjunctive normal form;decision heuristics;disjoint variable supports;hypergraph partitioning techniques;image computation;partition-based decision heuristics;partitioning information;reachability analysis;separator-set induced partitioning","","9","1","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we generalize the computation so that the result is independent of the implementation at the node. The CODCs propagated by this computation are proved to be maximal in some sense. Local don't cares (LDCs) are CODCs of a node, pre-imaged to the primary inputs and then imaged and projected to the local fanins of the node. LDCs combine CODCs with SDCs (satisfiability don't cares), but only the CODC part is propagated to the fanin network. Another form of local don't cares, propagates both the CODC and SDC parts to the fanin network. Both are shown to be compatible in some sense, but conservative. We give a method for updating both kinds of local don't cares incrementally when other nodes in the network are changed.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968725","","Aging;Circuits;Computer networks;Observability","Boolean functions;circuit optimisation;logic CAD;observability","Boolean networks;CODCs;SDCs;compatible observability don't cares;local don't cares;local fanins;local updating;logic synthesis;permissible functions;satisfiability don't cares","","3","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effect of vias, as additional heat sinking paths to alleviate the temperature rise in the metal wires, is included in the analysis to provide more accurate and realistic thermal diagnosis. It shows that the effectiveness of vias in reducing the temperature rise in interconnects is highly dependent on the via separation and the dielectric materials used. The analytical model is then applied to estimate the temperature distribution in multi-level interconnects. We discuss the possibility that, under the impact of thermal effects, the performance improvement expected from the use of low-k dielectric materials may be degraded.

First, substrate and optional ground plane loss and coupling effect are efficiently modeled by multilayer Green's functions, while the Green's functions are efficiently calculated via a window-based acceleration technique.

This is especially true because of the quality-of-service (QoS) aspects of these applications. Prominent examples of this can be found in MPEG4 and JPEG2000 standards and especially the new MPEG21 standard. In order to deal with these dynamic issues where tasks and complex data types are created and deleted at run-time based on non-deterministic events, a novel system design paradigm is required. Because of the high computation and communicating requirement from these kind of applications, multi-processor SoC (system on chip) is accepted as a solution (e.g., TriMedia), which is also promised by the advance of the processing technology. It is different from traditional general-purpose computers because it is application specific and it is an embedded system, which means costs like energy consumption are of major concern. This paper focused on the new requirements in system-level synthesis. In particular a ""task concurrency management"" problem formulation is proposed, with special focus on the formal definition of the most crucial optimization problems. The concept of Pareto curve based exploration is crucial in these formulations.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968632","","Application software;Concurrent computing;Costs;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;MPEG 4 Standard;Quality of service;Runtime;System-on-a-chip","Pareto distribution;application specific integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics;multimedia computing;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;quality of service","JPEG2000;MPEG21;MPEG4;Pareto curve based exploration;complex data types;dynamic concurrent task-based systems;energy consumption;multi-media applications;multiprocessor SoC;nondeterministic events;quality-of-service;system design paradigm;system-level synthesis","","0","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current transient power analysis and reduction approaches are mostly at the transistor- and logic-levels. We argue that, as was the case with average power minimization, architectural solutions to transient power problems can complement and significantly extend the scope of lower-level techniques. In this work, we present a high-level synthesis approach to transient power management. We demonstrate how high-level synthesis can impact the cycle-by-cycle peak power and peak power differential for the synthesized implementation. Further, we demonstrate that it is necessary to consider transient power metrics judiciously in order to minimize or avoid area and performance overheads. In order to alleviate the limits on parallelism imposed by peak power constraints, we propose a novel technique based on the selective insertion of data monitor operations in the behavioral description. We present enhanced scheduling algorithms that can accept constraints on transient power characteristics (in addition to the conventional resource and performance constraints). Experimental results on several example designs obtained using a state-of-the-art commercial design flow and technology library indicate that high-level synthesis with transient power management results in significant benefits-peak power reductions of up to 32% (average of 25%), and peak power differential reductions of up to 59% (average of 42%)-with minimal performance overheads.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968703","","Circuits;Energy consumption;Energy management;High level synthesis;Libraries;Minimization;Monitoring;Power dissipation;Scheduling algorithm;Transient analysis","VLSI;high level synthesis;nanotechnology;power supply circuits;power system transients","cycle-by-cycle peak power;enhanced scheduling algorithms;high-level synthesis;logic-levels;nanometer technologies;power consumption;power dissipation;power gradient;transient characteristics;transient power analysis;transistor levels","","7","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efficiency of the algorithm is achieved by two new techniques. First, in order to evaluate each solution in linear time, we propose a new algorithm based on the acyclic orientation of the memory conflict graph. Second, we propose a novel representation of the solution which effectively compresses the potentially infinite solution space to a finite value of n!, where n is the number of vertices in the memory conflict graph. Furthermore, if a near-optimal solution is satisfactory, this value can be dramatically reduced to /spl chi/!, where /spl chi/! is the chromatic number of the memory conflict graph.

Wavelet-like methods have been applied to sparsifying the resistance matrix representing the substrate coupling, but the accuracy of the method is very sensitive to the particulars of the contact layout. In this paper we show that for the substrate problem it is possible to improve considerably on the wavelet-like methods by making use of the algorithmic structure common to the fast multipole and wavelet-like algorithms, but making judicious use of low-rank approximations.

The proposed simulation methodology is 3-17/spl times/ faster, while being sufficiently accurate (within 5%) when compared to the fully detailed simulator The design exploration environment is able to vary different microarchitectural configurations and find the optimal one as far as energy/spl times/delay product is concerned in a matter of minutes. The parameters that are found to affect drastically the core processor power/performance metrics are issue width, instruction window size, and pipeline depth, along with correlated clock frequency. For very high-end configurations for which balanced pipelining, may not be possible, opportunities for running faster stages at lower voltage exist.

Our compiler-based strategy modifies the original execution order of loop iterations in array-dominated applications to increase the length of the time period(s) in which memory banks axe idle (i.e., not accessed by any loop iteration). To achieve this it first classifies loop iterations according to their bank access patterns and then, with the help of a polyhedral tool, tries to bring the iterations with similar bank access patterns close together. Increasing the idle periods of memory banks brings two major benefits; first, it allows us to place more memory banks into low-power operating modes, and second, it enables us to use a more aggressive (i.e., more energy saving) operating mode for a given bank. Our strategy has been evaluated using seven array-dominated applications on both a cacheless system and a system with cache memory. Our results indicate that the strategy is very successful in reducing the memory system energy, and improves the memory energy by as much as 34% on the average.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968619","","Batteries;Cache memory;Costs;Design optimization;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Pattern classification;Runtime;Signal design;Signal processing","cache storage;digital storage;optimisation;program compilers;storage allocation","access pattern classification;array-dominated applications;bank access patterns;banked memory system;cache memory;cacheless system;compiler-based strategy;data-driven strategy;energy saving operating mode;idle periods;loop iterations classification;low-power operating modes;memory energy consumption optimisation;polyhedral tool","","5","9","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The benchmark results show that although higher granularity can have better speedup because of dominance of computation over communication, the computational granularity cannot overshadow the inherent synchronization cost.

As far as routing is concerned, in order to capitalize on the enormous resources and time already spent on routing the circuit, and to meet time-to-market requirements, it is desirable to re-route only the ECO-affected portion of the circuit, while minimizing any routing changes in the much larger unaffected part of the circuit. Incremental re-routing also needs to be fast and to effectively use available routing resources. We develop a complete incremental routing methodology for FPGAs using a novel approach called bump and refit (B&R). We significantly extend this concept to global and detailed incremental routing for FPGAs with complex switchboxes such as those in Lucent's ORCA and Minx's Virtex series. We also introduce new concepts such as B&R cost estimation during global routing, and determination of the optimal subnet set to bump for each bumped net, which we obtain using an efficient dynamic programming formulation.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968611","","Circuits;Cost function;Fault tolerance;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic devices;Logic programming;Process design;Programmable logic arrays;Programmable logic devices;Routing","circuit CAD;circuit layout CAD;dynamic programming;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD;network routing","ECO applications;FPGAs;ORCA;Virtex;available routing resources;bumped net;complex switchboxes;cost estimation;design changes;dynamic programming formulation;engineering change order;global routing;incremental physical CAD;incremental routing;optimal subnet set;search-based bump-and-refit approach","","0","1","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key algorithmic innovations are (a) early identification of essential diffusion-merged MOS device groups called clusters, but (b) deferred binding of clusters to a specific shape-level layout until the very end of a multi-phase placement strategy. A global placer arranges uncommitted clusters; a detailed placer optimizes clusters at shape level for density and for overall routability. A commercial router completes the flow.

None of the existing algorithms is ""exact"" in the sense that the algorithm may fail to route all nets even though a feasible solution exists. This remains to be true even if only 2-pin nets between two blocks are concerned. In this paper, we present the first polynomial-time exact algorithm for simultaneous pin assignment and routing for 2-pin nets from one block (source block) to all other blocks. In addition to finding a feasible solution whenever one exists, it guarantees to find a pin-assignment/routing solution with minimum cost /spl alpha//spl middot/W + /spl beta//spl middot/V, where W is the total wirelength and V is the total number of vias.

To manage complexity and time-to-market, SoC designs require a high level of automation and reuse. Digital methodologies are inapplicable to analog IP, which relies on tight control of low-level device and circuit properties that vary widely across manufacturing processes. This analog synthesis solution automates these tedious, technology specific aspects of analog design. Unlike previously proposed approaches, ASF extends the prevalent ""schematic and SPICE"" methodology used to design analog and mixed-signal circuits.

Furthermore, ASF employs a novel numerical optimization formulation that incorporates classical downhill techniques into stochastic search.

Typically, noise analysis makes the assumption that all aggressing nets can simultaneously switch in the same direction. This creates a worst-case noise pulse on the victim net that often leads to false noise violations. In this paper, we present a new approach that uses logic implications to identify the maximum set of aggressor nets that can inject noise simultaneously under the logic constraints of the circuit. We propose an approach to efficiently generate logic implications from a transistor-level description and propagate them in the circuit using ROBDD representations of the DC-connected components and a newly proposed lateral propagation method. We then show that the problem of finding the worst case logically feasible noise can be represented as a maximum weighted independent set problem and show how to efficiently solve it. Initially, we restrict our discussion to zero-delay implications, which are valid for glitch-free circuits and then extend our approach to timed implications. The proposed approaches were implemented in an industrial noise analysis tool and results are shown for a number of industrial test cases. We demonstrate that a significant reduction in the number of noise failures can be obtained from considering the logic implications as proposed in this paper, underscoring the need for false-noise analysis.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968695","","Capacitance;Circuit noise;Delay effects;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Noise reduction;Switches;Switching circuits;Timing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;delays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit noise;logic CAD;logic simulation;timing","ROBDD representations;VLSI designs;VLSI interconnects;cross-coupled noise analysis;false noise violations;false-noise analysis;glitch-free circuits;industrial noise analysis tool;industrial test cases;lateral propagation method;logic constraints;logic implications;maximum aggressor net set;maximum weighted independent set problem;noise analysis;noise failures;simultaneous noise injection;simultaneously switching aggressing nets;timed implications;transistor-level description;victim net;worst case logically feasible noise;worst-case noise pulse;zero-delay implications","","20","3","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In previous work, it has been shown that several hardware allocation/binding problems for power optimization can be formulated as network flow problems and be solved optimally. However, in these formulations, a fixed schedule was assumed. In such context, one key problem is: given an optimal network flow solution to a hardware allocation/binding problem for a schedule, how to generate a new optimal network flow solution rapidly for a local change of the schedule. To this end, from a comprehensive analysis of the relation between network structure and flow computation, we devise a two-step procedure: (Step 1) max-flow computation step which finds a valid (maximum) flow solution while retaining the previous (maximum flow of minimum cost) solution as much as possible; (Step 2) min-cost computation step which incrementally refines the flow solution obtained in Step 1, using the concept of finding a negative cost cycle in the residual graph for the flow. The proposed algorithm can be applied effectively to several important high-level data path optimization problems (e.g., allocations/bindings of functional units, registers, buses, and memory ports) when we have the freedom to choose a schedule that will minimize power consumption. Experimental results (for bus synthesis) on benchmark problems show that our designs are 5.2% more power-efficient over the best known results, which is due to (a) exploitation of the effect of scheduling and (b) optimal binding for every schedule instance. Furthermore, our algorithm is about 2.8 times faster in run time over the full network flow based (optimal) bus synthesis algorithm, which is due to (c) our novel (two-step) mechanism which utilize the previous flow solution to reduce redundant flow computations.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968704","","Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Network synthesis;Optimization methods;Portable computers;Power dissipation;Processor scheduling;Very large scale integration","circuit optimisation;high level synthesis;power supplies to apparatus;scheduling;system buses","behavioral synthesis;fixed schedule;flow computation;high-level data path optimization;network structure;optimal network flow solution;power consumption;power optimization;two-step procedure","","3","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this problem has been addressed extensively, the existing solutions apply only simple synthesis transforms during physical layout and are generally unable to reverse decisions made during logic minimization and technology mapping, that have a major negative impact on circuit structure. In our novel approach, we propose congestion aware algorithms for layout driven decomposition and technology mapping, two of the steps that affect congestion the most during logic synthesis, to effectively decrease wire length and improve congestion.

Instead of random-access registers, relative location storages or rotating register files are used to exploit the available parallelism of resources by means of reducing the initiation interval in pipelined schedules. Therefore, the compiler or synthesis tool must deal with the difficult tasks of scheduling of operations and location assignment of values while respecting all the constraints including the storage file capacity. This paper presents a method that handles constraints of relative location storages during scheduling together with timing and resource constraints. The characteristics of the coloring of conflict graphs, representing the relative overlap of value instances, are analyzed in order to identify the bottlenecks for location assignment with the aim of serializing their lifetimes.

The proposed method presents several merits compared with those conventional techniques. First, the algorithm for expanding input-output functions by wavelets is a general-purpose approach, which can be applied in automatically modeling of different analog circuit blocks with different structures. Second, both the small signal effect and the large signal effect are modeled in a unified formulation, which eases the process of modeling and simulation.

We cast the problem as solving abstract equations over languages. Language equations can be defined with respect to several language composition operators such as synchronous composition, /spl middot/, and parallel composition, /spl square/; conformity can be checked by language containment. In this paper, we address parallel language equations. Parallel composition arises in the context of modeling delay-insensitive processes and their environments. The parallel composition operator models an exchange protocol by which an input is followed by an output after a finite exchange of internal signals. It abstracts a system with two components with a single message in transit, such that at each instance either the components exchange messages or one of them communicates with its environment, which submits the next external input to the system only after the system has produced an external output in response to the previous input. We study the most general solutions of the language equation A/spl square/X/spl sube/C, and define the language operators needed to express them. Then we specialize such equations to languages associated with important classes of automata used for modeling systems, e.g., regular languages and FSM languages. In particular, for A/spl square/X/spl sube/C, we give algorithms for computing: the largest FSM language solution, the largest complete solution, and the largest solution whose composition with A yields a complete FSM language. We solve also FSM equations under bounded parallel composition.

While there are many combinations of X inputs in the test set generally, the proposed method finds one including X inputs as many as possible, by using fault simulation and procedures similar to implication and justification of ATPG algorithms. Experimental results for ISCAS benchmark circuits show that approximately 66% of inputs of un-compacted test sets could be X in average. Even for compacted test sets, the method found that approximately 47% of inputs are X. Finally, we discuss how logic values are reassigned to the identified X inputs where several applications exist to make test vectors more desirable.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968648","","Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Combinational circuits;Electronic equipment testing;Fault detection;Logic testing;Microelectronics;Test pattern generators","automatic test pattern generation;combinational circuits;fault simulation;logic testing","ATPG algorithm;combinational circuit;don't care inputs;fault coverage;fault simulation;logic values;stuck-at fault;test pattern","","31","3","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","337","341","In gigascale integrated circuits (GSI), interconnects are expected to play a more dominant role in circuit performance than transistor cells. The circuit performance is affected by signal integrity as cross-talk becomes more significant with the sealing of feature sizes. Many attempts have been made to improve noise immunity, but all require the sacrifice of speed as a tradeoff, especially in dynamic circuits. Avoiding noise problems while maintaining the desired speed would involve increased wire spacing or extensive shielding, both of which are unfavorable due to demands for high density and a relatively higher cost of wires in current process technologies. We propose a novel methodology in which clock lines are used as shielding wires to reduce cross-talk effects in domino circuits, thereby minimizing the possibility of functional failures. In addition, this method provides another benefit: a small buffer size is required for driving a long interconnect for iso-noise immunity. Since clock lines, which are always required in domino circuits, are used to shield signal lines, speed penalty and area overhead which are drawbacks of previous work can be avoided. This design methodology CASh (Clock As Shielding) demonstrates the superiority over conventional methods. HSPICE simulations on a 2-input domino AND gate and 4 and 8-bit full adders designed in CASh show higher noise immunity over conventional design.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968644","","Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Costs;Crosstalk;Design methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit noise;Wires","SPICE;adders;clocks;crosstalk;integrated circuit noise;logic design;logic gates;shielding","4 bit;8 bit;AND gate;CASh;Clock as Shield design methodology;HSPICE simulation;buffer size;crosstalk;domino circuit;dynamic circuit;full adder;gigascale integrated circuit;interconnect;noise immunity;precharge-evaluate logic;signal integrity","","1","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Crosstalk between adjacent wires on the bus may create a significant portion of this delay. Placing a shield wire between each signal wire alleviates the crosstalk problem but doubles the area used by the bus, an unacceptable consequence when the bus is routed using scarce top-level metal resources. Instead, we propose to employ data encoding to eliminate crosstalk delay within a bus. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the theory behind ""self-shielding codes"", and gives the fundamental theoretical limits on the performance of codes with and without memory. Specifically, we find that a 32-bit bus can be encoded with 40 wires using a code with memory or 46 wires with a memoryless code, in comparison to the 63 wires required with simple shielding.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968598","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968598","","Capacitance;Clocks;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Encoding;Geometry;Logic;Performance analysis;Propagation delay;Wires","circuit layout CAD;crosstalk;delays;high-speed integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;network routing;shielding","32 bit;adjacent wires;bus encoding;crosstalk delay;high-speed designs;memoryless code;on-chip buses;propagation delay;scarce top-level metal resources;self-shielding codes;shield wire","","106","3","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the problem of constructing routing trees with simultaneous buffer insertion and wire sizing in the presence of routing and buffer obstacles. No previous algorithms consider all these factors simultaneously. Previous dynamic programming based algorithm is first extended to solve the problem. However, with the size of routing graph increasing and with wire sizing taken into account, the time and space requirement increases enormously. Then a new approach is proposed to formulate the problem as a series of graph problems. The routing tree solution is obtained by finding shortest paths in a series of graphs. In the new approach, wire sizing can be handled almost without any additional time and space requirement, Moreover, the time and space requirement is only polynomial in terms of the size of routing graph. Our algorithm differs from traditional dynamic programming, and is capable of addressing the problem of inverter insertion and sink polarity. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the graph-based algorithm outperforms the DP-based algorithm by a large margin. We also propose a hierarchical approach to construct routing tree for a large number of sinks.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968597","","Delay;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Integrated circuit interconnections;Inverters;Polynomials;Routing;Tree graphs;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit CAD;computational complexity;constraint handling;delays;graphs;integrated circuit design;network routing;trees (mathematics)","buffer insertion;buffer obstacles;deep submicron VLSI design;dynamic programming;graph;routing graph;routing trees;shortest paths;simultaneous buffer insertion;wire sizing","","21","3","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such a situation, logic synthesis and layout synthesis are iterated until the estimates match. The number of such iterations is becoming larger as technology scales. Timing closure problems occur mainly due to the difficulty in accurately predicting interconnect delay during logic synthesis. In this paper, we present an algorithm that integrates logic synthesis and global placement to address the timing closure problem. We introduce technology independent algorithms as well as technology dependent algorithms. Our technology independent algorithms are based on the notion of ""wire-planning"". All these algorithms interleave their logic operations with local and incremental/full global placement, in order to maintain a consistent placement while the algorithm is run. We show that by integrating logic synthesis and placement, we avoid the need to predict interconnect delay during logic synthesis. We demonstrate that our scheme significantly enhances the predictability of wire delays, thereby solving the timing closure problem. This is the main result of our paper. Our results also show that our algorithms result in a significant reduction in total circuit delay.

Certain devices common in high-frequency integrated circuit applications, such as spiral inductors, SAW filters, etc., are often described and studied in the frequency domain. Models take the form of frequency domain data obtained through measurement or through physical simulation. Usually the available data is sampled, incomplete, noisy, and covers only a finite range of the spectrum. In this paper we present a methodology for generating guaranteed passive time-domain models of frequency-described subsystems. The methodology presented is based on convex programming based algorithms for fixed denominator system identification. The algorithm is guaranteed to produce a passive system model that is optimal in the sense of having minimum weighted square error in the frequency band of interest over all models with a prescribed set of system poles. An incremental-fitting reformulation of the problem is also introduced that trades optimality for efficiency while still guaranteeing passivity. Results of the application of the proposed methodologies to the modeling of a variety of subsystems are presented and discussed.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968626","","Application specific integrated circuits;Circuit simulation;Frequency domain analysis;Frequency measurement;Inductors;Integrated circuit measurements;Integrated circuit noise;SAW filters;Spirals;Time domain analysis","computational complexity;convex programming;frequency response;frequency-domain synthesis;identification;inductors;integrated circuit design;surface acoustic wave filters","SAW filters;computational cost;frequency-described subsystems;highfrequency integrated circuit;incremental-fitting reformulation;passive time-domain models;spiral inductors;system integration","","22","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe new scheduling heuristics for memory-based designs with multiple asynchronous clock domains that are mapped to parallel verification systems. The scheduling approach scales to an unlimited number of clock domains and converges quickly to a feasible solution if one exists.

We present a novel fast constructive technique that relocates the instruction code in such a manner into the main memory that the cache is utilized more efficiently. The technique is applied as a re-processing step, i.e. before the code is executed. it is applicable for embedded systems where the number and characteristics of tasks running on the system are known a priori. The technique does not impose any computational overhead to the system. As a result of applying our technique to a variety of real-world applications we measured (through simulation) that the number of cache misses drops significantly.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","439","442","We present a two-level Boolean minimization tool (BOOM) based on a new implicant generation paradigm. In contrast to all previous minimization methods, where the implicants are generated bottom-up, the proposed method uses a top-down approach. Thus instead of increasing the dimensionality of implicants by omitting literals from their terms, the dimension of a term is gradually decreased by adding new literals. Unlike most other minimization tools like ESPRESSO, BOOM does not use the definition of the function to be minimized as a basis for the solution, and thus the original coverage influences the solution only indirectly through the number of literals used. Most minimization methods use two basic phases introduced by Quine-McCluskey, known as prime implicant (PI) generation and the covering problem solution. Some more modern methods, like ESPRESSO, combine these two phases, reducing the number of PIs to be processed. This approach is also used in BOOM, where the search for new literals to be included into a term aims at maximum coverage of the output function. The function to be minimized is defined by its on-set and off-set, listed in a truth table. Thus the don't care set, often representing the dominant part of the truth table, need not be specified explicitly. The proposed minimization method is efficient above all for functions with a large number of input variables while only few care terms are defined. The minimization procedure is very fast, hence if the first solution does not meet the requirements, it can be improved in an iterative manner. The method has been tested on several different kinds of problems, like the MCNC standard benchmarks or larger problems generated randomly.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968667","","Benchmark testing;Circuit testing;Computer science;Digital circuits;Electronic mail;Field programmable gate arrays;Input variables;Minimization methods;Programmable logic arrays;Switching circuits","Boolean functions;heuristic programming;iterative methods;logic CAD;minimisation;software tools","BOOM heuristic Boolean minimizer;ESPRESSO minimization tool;MCNC standard benchmarks;PI generation;bottom-up implicant generation;care terms;covering problem solution;function don't care set;function minimization;function off-set;function on-set;implicant dimensionality;implicant generation paradigm;input variables;iterative method;literals;maximum output function coverage;minimization methods;minimization procedure;prime implicant generation;top-down implicant generation;truth table;two-level Boolean minimization tool","","7","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","264","","Modern embedded computing systems tend to be heterogeneous assemblages of concurrent subsystems, typically described in different languages and semantics which are well established in the various application fields. For example, the specification of the functional and timing behavior necessitates a mixture of different basic models of computation and communication which come from transformatlive or reactive domains. There is little hope that a single language will replace this heterogeneous set of languages. In fact, experiments with system specification languages show that there is not a unique universal specification language to support the whole life cycle. A similar problem occurs when reused components shall be integrated, possibly described in another language and incompletely documented. Examples would be components of other companies or ""legacy code"". The lack of coherency of the different languages, methods and toots is a substantial obstacle on the way to higher design productivity and design quality. A design process must be able to bridge the semantic differences for verification and synthesis and should account for limited knowledge of system properties. This paper describes approaches which allow for the common representation of different languages and incomplete specifications. In particular, recent results on the use of internal design representations targeted to scheduling and design space exploration are reviewed. The information useful for methods like allocation of resources, partitioning the design and scheduling must be estimated or extracted from the various input languages and mapped onto internal representations which describe properties of the subsystems and their coordination. Design methods work on these internal representations and eventually refine them by adding components and reducing non-determinism.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968631","","Assembly systems;Bridges;Computational modeling;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Process design;Productivity;Specification languages;Timing","embedded systems;processor scheduling;specification languages","concurrent subsystems;design productivity;design quality;design space exploration;embedded systems;functional behavior;heterogeneous assemblages;internal design representations;reactive domains;semantics;system specification languages;timing behavior","","0","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multilevel framework with recursive coarsening and refinement in a ""V-shaped"" flow allows efficient scaling of the gridless detailed router to very large designs. The downward pass of recursive coarsening builds the representations of routing regions at different levels, while the upward pass of iterative refinement allows a gradual convergence to a globally optimized solution. The use of a multicommodity flow-based routing algorithm for the initial routing at the coarsest level and a modified maze algorithm for the refinement at each level considerably improves the quality of gridless routing results. Compared with the recently published gridless detailed routing algorithm using wire planning, the multilevel gridless routing algorithm is 3/spl times/ to 75/spl times/faster. We also compared the multilevel framework with a recently developed three-level routing approach and a traditional hierarchical routing approach.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968655","","Approximation algorithms;Computer science;Delay;Iterative algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Routing;Silicon;Tiles;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;iterative methods;network routing;wiring","V-shaped flow;completion rates;full-chip gridless routing;globally optimized solution;hierarchical routing approach;iterative refinement;maze algorithm;multicommodity flow-based routing algorithm;multilevel approach;multilevel optimization;recursive coarsening;routing regions;wire planning","","27","73","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","565","572","A new heuristic is presented for the general cell placement problem where the objective is to minimize total bounding box netlength. The heuristic is based on the Guided Local Search (GLS) metaheuristic. GLS modifies the objective function in a constructive way to escape local minima. Previous attempts to use local search on final (or detailed) placement problems have often failed as the neighborhood quickly becomes too excessive for large circuits. Nevertheless, by combining GLS with Fast Local Search it is possible to focus the search on appropriate sub-neighborhoods, thus reducing the time complexity considerably. Comprehensive computational experiments with the developed algorithm are reported on small, medium and large industrial circuits, and for standard cell and general cell variants of the problem. The experiments demonstrate that the developed algorithm is able to improve the estimated routing length of large-sized general cell layouts with as much as 20 percent. The general nature of the proposed method makes it easy to incorporate other goals, such as routability and timing constraints, into the objective function. Current layout algorithms use a feedback approach in which a placement is evaluated by performing (partial) routing and timing analysis; the output of this analysis is then used to construct an improved placement. This iterative nature of the design process calls for placement algorithms that take an existing placement and construct an improved placement that resembles the original one, but in which the information from the routing/timing analysis is taken into account.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968708","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computer industry;Iterative algorithms;Output feedback;Performance analysis;Routing;Standards development;Timing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;cellular arrays;integrated circuit layout;iterative methods;network routing;search problems","VLSI design;bounding box netlength;fast local search;feedback;final placement;guided local search;heuristic;industrial circuit;iterative method;layout algorithm;metaheuristic;objective function;routing length;standard cell;time complexity;timing analysis","","3","13","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been demonstrated as one of the most effective low power system design techniques, in particular for real time systems. Previously, there are works on both ends of the DVS systems: the ideal variable voltage system which can change its voltage with no physical constraints, and the multiple voltage system which has a number of discrete voltages available simultaneously. In this paper, we study the DVS systems between these two extreme cases. We consider systems that can vary the operating voltage dynamically under various real-life physical constraints. Based on the system's different behavior during voltage transition, we define the feasible DVS system and the practical DVS system. We build mathematical model to analyze the potential of DVS on energy saving for these different systems. Finally, we simulate the behavior of a secure wireless communication networks with DVS systems. The results show that DVS results in energy reduction from 36% to 79%, and the real life DVS systems can be very close to the ideal system in energy saving.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968707","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968707","","Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Mathematical model;Power system dynamics;Power systems;Real time systems;Voltage control;Wireless communication","low-power electronics;mobile radio;power supply circuits;radio networks","dynamic voltage scaling;energy consumption;energy saving;mathematical model;multiple voltage system;power reduction 36% to 79%;power system design;secure wireless communication networks","","18","","","","","4-8 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-08 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","553","557","Most existing buffering algorithms neglect the impact of inductance on circuit performance, which causes large error in circuit analysis and optimization. Even for the approaches considering inductance effects, their delay models are too simplistic to catch the actual performance. As delay-length dependence is approaching linear with inductance effect (Ismail and Friedman, 1999), fewer buffers are needed to reduce RLC delay. This motivates this work to propose a new algorithm for RLC buffer insertion. In this paper, a new buffer insertion algorithm considering inductance for intermediate and global interconnect is proposed, based on downstream impedance instead of traditional downstream capacitance. A new pruning technique that provides tremendous speedup and a new frequency estimation method that is very accurate in delay computation are also proposed. Experiments on industrial netlists demonstrate that our new algorithm reduces the number of buffers up to 34.4% over the traditional van Ginneken's algorithm that ignores inductance. Our impedance delay estimation is very accurate compared to SPICE simulations, with only 10% error while the delay model used in the previous RLC algorithm has 20% error (Ismael et al., 2001). The accurate delay model not only reduces the number of buffers, but also brings high fidelity to the buffer solutions.

However, there has been no easy way of optimizing (1) and (2) simultaneously at an early stage of the synthesis process. In this paper, we propose a new (onchip) bus synthesis algorithm to minimize the total sum of (1) and (2) in the microarchitecture synthesis. Specifically, unlike the previous approaches in which (1) and (2) are minimized sequentially without any interaction between them, or only one of them is minimized, we, given a scheduled dataflow graph to be synthesized, minimize (1) and (2) simultaneously by formulating and solving the two important issues in an integrated fashion: binding data transfers to buses and determining a (physical) order of signal lines in each bus, both of which are the most critical factors that affect the results of (1) and (2). Experimental results on a number of benchmark problems show that the proposed integrated low-power bus synthesis algorithm reduces power consumption by 24.8%, 40.3% and 18.1% on average over those in (J.

However, in some cases it may be required/preferable to use variations of the general SAT problem. In this paper we consider one important variation, the minimum-cost satisfiability problem (MinCostSAT). MinCostSAT is a SAT problem which minimizes the cost of the satisfying assignment. MinCostSAT has various applications, e.g. automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), FPGA routing, AI planning, etc. This problem has been tackled before - first by covering algorithms, e.g. scherzo (Coudert, 1996), and more recently by SAT based algorithms, e.g. bsolo (Manquinho and Marques-Silva, 2002). However the SAT algorithms they are based on are not the current generation of highly efficient solvers. The solvers in this generation, e.g. Chaff (Moskewicz et al., 2001), MiniSat (Een and Sorensson, 2006) etc., incorporate several new advances, e.g. two literal watching based Boolean Constraint Propagation, that have delivered order of magnitude speedups. We first point out the challenges in using this class of solvers for the MinCostSAT problem and then present techniques to overcome these challenges.

Existing works to fix crosstalk noise are mostly done at the routing or post routing stage, which may be too late. Since placement determines the overall routing congestion, which correlates with the coupling capacitance, which in turn correlates with the crosstalk noise, placement shall be a good level to do early noise mitigation. The only existing work for the crosstalk aware placement (to our best knowledge) is by Lou and Chen (2004), which uses the coupling capacitance map to guide placement. However, crosstalk is determined not only by the coupling capacitance, but also by many other factors, such as the driver resistance of the victim net and the coupling location (near source vs near sink coupling) (Cong et al., 2001). We introduce a concept of noise map which takes those factors into account. Guided by this accurate noise map explicitly, we propose an incremental placement technique to mitigate noise without disturbing the global placement order. Our incremental placement has two key steps, namely noise aware cell inflation and local refinement. Experimental results on industrial circuits show that our approach is able to reduce the number of top noise nets by 25% and improve the timing (300ps on the worst slack), with no wire length penalty or CPU overhead. Our incremental approach is also able to maintain the placement stability.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382608","","Capacitance;Central Processing Unit;Circuit noise;Crosstalk;Noise level;Noise reduction;Refining;Routing;Timing;Wire","crosstalk;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise","coupling capacitance map;coupling location;crosstalk noise;driver resistance;global placement order;industrial circuits;local refinement;near sink coupling;near source coupling;noise aware cell inflation;noise map;noise mitigation;overall routing congestion;placement stability;true crosstalk aware incremental placement","","7","","26","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
