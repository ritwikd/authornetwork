"Efficient incremental analysis of on-chip power grid via sparse approximation","Pei Sun; Xin Li; Ming-Yuan Ting","ECE Dept., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","676","681","In this paper, a new sparse approximation technique is proposed for incremental power grid analysis. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that when a power grid network is locally updated during circuit design, its response changes locally and, hence, the incremental “change” of the power grid voltage is almost zero at many internal nodes, resulting in a unique sparse pattern. An efficient Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed sparse approximation problem. In addition, several numerical techniques are proposed to improve the numerical stability of the proposed solver, while simultaneously maintaining its high efficiency. Several industrial circuit examples demonstrate that when applied to incremental power grid analysis, our proposed approach achieves up to 130× runtime speed-up over the traditional Algebraic Multi-Grid (AMG) method, without surrendering any accuracy.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981988","Incremental Analysis;Integrated Circuit;Power Grid","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Fitting;Matching pursuit algorithms;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Power grids","integrated circuit design;iterative methods;power integrated circuits;sparse matrices","algebraic multi-grid method;incremental analysis;numerical stability;on-chip power grid;orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm;sparse approximation","","0","","21","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, during the mask synthesis flow, a large number of machines are available to the user. Also, as multiple machines/cores become more ubiquitous, even designers using layout verification tools will have access to a large set of machines. Having an efficient and scalable distributed algorithm for performing sequences of layout geometry operations will be of great value to both the designer and the mask synthesis engineer. This paper seeks to present such an algorithm. Given a layout and a sequence of layout geometry operations, the layout is divided into several partitions. The given sequence of layout geometry operations is executed in parallel on the different partitions. The partitions are merged in a systematic manner and the sequence of operations is repeated on a suitable set of polygons in these newly derived partitions until a partition that covers the entire layout area is obtained. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is correct-by-construction - i.e., each partition is guaranteed to generate a subset of the correct results. The complete and correct results are generated for each layout geometry operation for the entire layout when the operation completes execution on all the partitions. Results on large industrial layouts are very promising and show good performance and scalability.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981711","Design Rule Checking;Parallel Processing","Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed algorithms;Geometry;Layout;Parallel processing;Partitioning algorithms;Servers","circuit analysis computing;circuit layout;computational geometry;distributed algorithms;formal verification","correct-by-construction;design rule checking;distributed algorithm;industrial layouts;layout geometry operations;layout verification tools;mask synthesis","","0","","6","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SystemC is a popular modeling language which can be used to specify systems at a high abstraction level. The module hierarchy of a SystemC model is dynamically constructed during the execution of the elaboration phase of the model. This means that a system designer can build regular structures using loops and conditional statements. Currently, most SystemC tools can not cope with SystemC models for which the module hierarchy depends on dynamic parameters. In our approach this hierarchical information is retrieved by controlling and monitoring the executing of the elaboration phase of the model using a GDB debugger. Thereafter, the behavioral information is retrieved by using a GCC plug-in. This plug-in produces abstract syntax trees in static single assignment form. This behavioral information is linked with the hierarchical information. Our approach is completely non-intrusive. The SystemC model and the SystemC reference implementation can be used without any modification. We have implemented our approach in a SystemC front-end called SHaBE (SystemC Hierarchy and Behavior Extractor).

However, our study indicates that this is not exactly correct. While considering the thermal effect of TSVs during placement appears to be quite complicated, we are able to prove that when the TSV area in each bin is proportional to the lumped power consumption in that bin, together with the bins in all the tiers directly above it, the peak temperature is minimized. Based on this criterion, we implement a thermal-aware 3D placement tool. Compared to the methods that prefer a uniform power distribution that only results in an 8% peak temperature reduction, our method reduces the peak temperature by 34% on average with even slightly less wirelength overhead. These results suggest that considering thermal effects of TSVs is necessary and effective during the placement stage.

Timing errors are detected using Razor flip-flops at critical-path endpoints and the error-rate feedback is used to control a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) control loop. We propose a new approach to bound the magnitude of intermittent timing errors at the circuit level by introducing a guard-band over which timing errors are safely mitigated. The guard-band is achieved by shaping the path delay distribution such that the critical paths correspond to a group of LSB result registers. These end-points are ensured to be critical by modifying the topology of the final stage carry-merge adder and by using tool-based device sizing. Hence, timing violations lead to weakly correlated logical errors of small magnitude in a mean-squared-error sense. We applied this approach to a digital filter in 32nm CMOS.

For a 4-layer implementation of an SRAM register in 45nm technology, we show that improving the TSV yield from 20% to 90% requires layout modifications that worsen register's performance up to four times. Moreover, the same 4-layer register that performs three times as fast as its single layer equivalent at 20% yield becomes twice slower at 70% yield when layout effects are considered.

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive pipelined MPSoC architecture that adapts itself to varying workloads. Our architecture consists of Main Processors and Auxiliary Processors with a distributed run-time balancing approach, where each Main Processor, independent of other Main Processors, decides for itself the number of required Auxiliary Processors at run-time depending on its varying workload. The proposed run-time balancing approach is based on off-line statistical information along with workload prediction and run-time monitoring of current and previous workloads' execution times. We exploited the adaptability of our architecture through a case study on an H.264 video encoder supporting HD720p at 30 fps, where clock- and power-gating were used to deactivate idle Auxiliary Processors during low workload periods. The results show that an adaptive pipelined MPSoC provides energy savings of up to 34% and 40% for clock- and power-gating based deactivation of Auxiliary Processors respectively with a minimum throughput of 29 fps when compared to a design-time balanced pipelined MPSoC.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981893","Adaptive MPSoCs;Low-Power Design","Clocks;Energy consumption;Motion estimation;Multimedia communication;Program processors;Streaming media;Throughput","multimedia systems;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip;video coding","H.264 video encoder;auxiliary processors;distributed run-time balancing approach;low-power adaptive pipelined MPSoC architecture;main processors;multimedia applications;off-line statistical information;run-time monitoring;workload prediction","","3","","28","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work describes a vectorless verification technique that deals with circuit uncertainty in the framework of current constraints. In such a framework, grid verification becomes a question of computing the worst-case voltage drops which, in turn, entails the solution of as many linear programs (LPs) as there are nodes. First, we extend grid verification to also check for the worst-case branch currents. We show that this would require as many LPs as there are branches. Second, we propose a starkly different approach to reduce the number of LPs in the verification problem. We achieve this by examining dominance relations among node voltage drops and among branch currents. This allows us to replace a group of LPs by one conservative and tight LP. Results show a dramatic reduction in the number of LPs thus making vectorless grid verification in the framework of current constraints practical and scalable.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981864","Power grid;dominance;voltage drop","Approximation methods;Equations;Power grids;Sparse matrices;Symmetric matrices;Uncertainty;Upper bound","integrated circuit design;linear programming;power grids","LP;branch dominance;design process;integrated circuits;linear programs;node dominance;power grid verification;worst-case voltage drops","","0","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present CAPS, an online adaptive algorithm that efficiently explores the design space of any given core and returns an accurate characterization of its implementation tradeoffs in terms of an approximate Pareto set. It does so by supervising the order of the time-consuming logic-synthesis runs on the core's components. Our algorithm can provably achieve the desired precision on the approximation in the shortest possible time, without having any a-priori information on any component.

Typically, designers attempt to reduce this computational load by choosing, based on experience, a subset of the available corners and running static timing analysis (STA) at only these corners. Although running a few corners, which are chosen beforehand, can lead to acceptable results in some cases, this is not always the case. Our results show that in the case of setup timing analysis, one can indeed bound circuit slacks across all corners by running a small number of corners. On the other hand, we show that this is not possible in the case of hold analysis. Instead, we present an alternative method for performing fast and accurate hold timing analysis which covers all corners. In this method a full timing run is performed for a small number of corners, and partial timing runs, which cover only the clock network, are performed for others. We then combine the results of the full and partial runs to find the worst-case hold slacks over all corners.

While such assumptions may hold when profiling certain classes of variations, a number of recent modeling studies suggest that non-stationarities arise from both shifts in the process mean as well as fluctuations in the variance of the process. In order to provide a compact model for non-stationary process variations, we introduce a new hybrid spatial modeling framework that models the spatially varying random field as a union of non-overlapping rectangular regions where the process is assumed to be locally-stationary within each region. To estimate the parameters in our hybrid spatial model, we develop a host of techniques to both estimate the change-points in the random field and to find an appropriate partitioning of the chip into disjoint regions where the field is locally-stationary.

Messages are scheduled incrementally on FlexRay according to the automotive design paradigm where new applications are added iteratively. On this account, the schedules must be (i) sustainable, i.e., when messages are added in later iterations, they must preserve deadline guarantees of existing messages and (ii) extensible, i.e., they must accommodate future messages without changes to existing schedules. Unfortunately, traditionally used metrics of sustainability and extensibility for timing and schedulability analysis are generic and can not be trivially adapted to FlexRay schedules. This is because of platform-specific properties of FlexRay like being a hybrid paradigm, where both time-triggered and event-triggered segments are used for communication. In this paper, we first introduce new notions of sustainability and extensibility for FlexRay that capture protocol-specific properties and then present novel metrics to quantify sustainable and extensible schedules.

While the task of analyzing timing characteristics of design alternatives has been extensively investigated in recent years, there is still a lack of methods for accurate and fast thermal analysis. In order to obtain desired evaluation times, the system has to be simulated at a high abstraction level. This often results in a loss of accuracy, mainly due to missing knowledge of system's characteristics.

It approximates the temperature calculation, which is done by taking the product of Green's function and power density integrated over space. The correlation coefficient between thermal signature and temperature is shown to be quite high, more than 0.7 in many examples.

The clock signals have to be delivered by through-silicon vias (TSVs) to different tiers with minimum skew and latency. While there are a few related works in literature, none of them considers the reliability of TSVs. Accordingly, the failure of any TSV in the clock tree yields a bad chip. The naive solution using double-TSV can alleviate the problem. But the significant area overhead renders it less practical for large designs. In this paper, we propose a novel TSV fault-tolerant unit (TFU) that can provide tolerance against TSV failures in a 3D clock network. It makes use of the existing 2D redundant trees designed for pre-bond testing, and thus has minimum area overhead. Compared to the double TSV technique, the 3D clock network constructed by our TFUs can achieve 61% area reduction with 3.9% yield rate improvement on an industrial case.

In this paper we propose a technique to configure the simulation environment optimally considering the application characteristics. Particularly, we focus on three design axes, simulation platform selection, mapping of component simulators to participating host processors and period of null message transfer for time synchronization. As a result, the proposed technique enables the efficient exploitation of parallelism by 1) well-balanced distribution of simulation workloads to host processors and 2) the minimized overhead for null message transfer, in turn, leading to the maximal simulation performance.

The main idea behind the proposed approach lies on the observation that not all operations are equally important in shaping the output quality of various applications and of the overall system. Based on such an observation, we suggest that all levels of the software design stack, including the programming model, compiler, operating system (OS) and run-time system should identify the critical tasks and ensure correct operation of such tasks by assigning them to dynamically adjusted reliable cores/units. Specifically, based on error rates and operating conditions identified by a sense-and-adapt (SeA) unit, the OS selects and sets the right mode of operation of the overall system. The run-time system identifies the critical/less-critical tasks based on special directives and schedules them to the appropriate units that are dynamically adjusted for highly-accurate/approximate operation by tuning their voltage/frequency. Units that execute less significant operations can operate at voltages less than what is required for correct operation and consume less power, if required, since such tasks do not need to be always exact as opposed to the critical ones. Such scheme can lead to energy efficient and reliable operation, while reducing the design cost and overheads of conventional circuit/micro-architecture level techniques.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981948","Approximate Computing;Energy Efficient;Software","Energy efficiency;Hardware;Integrated circuit reliability;Reliability engineering;Software;Software reliability","compiler generators;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers)","circuit/microarchitecture level;compiler;design paradigm;error rates;next-generation multicore heterogeneous platforms;next-generation unreliable platforms;operating system;programming model;run-time system;sense-and-adapt unit;significance driven computation;software design stack;variation-aware operation","","0","","5","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clearly, not addressing (1) and (2) in polarity assignment may cause a severe inaccuracy on the peak current estimation, which results in unnecessarily high peak current.

For example, side channel attacks such as differential cryptanalysis can easily and noninvasively extract secrets from unprotected SoCs. Vulnerabilities can be difficult to anticipate, since common design and verification tools do not necessarily provide clear visibility into how devices will fail when pushed outside of its normal operational conditions. The security challenges facing the semiconductor industry are also in part educational; while security training is common for software developers, relatively few hardware engineers have specialized security knowledge.

The electrostatic interactions between a molecule and solvent are particularly difficult to model theoretically, due to the forces' long range and the collective response of many thousands of solvent molecules. The dominant modeling approaches represent the two extremes of the trade-off between molecular realism and computational efficiency: all-atom molecular dynamics in explicit solvent, and macroscopic continuum theory (the Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equation). We present the first fast-solver implementation of an advanced nonlocal continuum theory that combines key advantages of both approaches. In particular, molecular realism is included by limiting solvent dielectric response on short length scales, using a model for nonlocal dielectric response allows the resulting problem (a linear integro-differential Poisson equation) to be reformulated as a system of coupled boundary-integral equations using double reciprocity. Whereas previous studies using the nonlocal theory had been limited to small model problems, owing to computational cost, our work opens the door to studying much larger problems including rational drug design, protein engineering, and nanofluidics.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982001","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Electric potential;Electrostatics;Equations;Mathematical model;Solvents","Boltzmann equation;Poisson equation;boundary integral equations;electrostatics;macromolecules;molecular biophysics;molecular dynamics method","Poisson-Boltzmann equation;all-atom molecular dynamics;biological molecules;biomolecular engineering;biomolecular science;boundary-integral equations;double reciprocity;electrostatic interactions;linear integro-differential Poisson equation;macroscopic continuum theory;molecular realism;nonlocal dielectric response;nonlocal electrostatic theory","","0","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can gate up to 2X clock switches with less than 5% area overhead when compared to the state-of-the-art SAT-based clock gating methodology.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981983","Clock gating;Interpolation","Clocks;Heuristic algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling;Interpolation;Logic gates;Registers;Runtime","backtracking;computability;interpolation;power aware computing","SAT-based Craig interpolation technique;SAT-based clock gating algorithm;dynamic backtracking limit controller;dynamic power saving;gating capability filter;shrinking method","","0","","11","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Dynamic voltage scaling of OLED displays","Donghwa Shin; Younghyun Kim; Naehyuck Chang; Pedram, M.","Seoul Nat. Univ., Seoul, South Korea","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","53","58","Unlike liquid crystal display (LCD) panels that require high-intensity backlight, organic LED (OLED) display panels naturally consume low power and provide high image quality thanks to their self-illuminating characteristic. In spite of this fact, the OLED display panel is still the dominant power consumer in battery-operated devices. As a result, there have been many attempts to reduce the OLED power consumption. Since power consumption of any pixel of the OLED display depends on the color that it displays, previous power saving methods change the pixel color subject to a tolerance level on the color distortion specified by the users. In practice, the OLED power saving techniques cannot be used on common user applications such as photo viewers and movie players. This paper introduces the first OLED power saving technique that does not result in a significant degradation in the color and luminance values of the displayed image. The proposed technique is based on dynamic (driving) voltage scaling (DVS) of the OLED panel. Although the proposed DVS technique may degrade luminance of the panel, the panel luminance can be restored with appropriate image compensation. Consequently, power is saved on the OLED display panel with only minor changes in the color and luminance of the image. This technique is similar to dynamic backlight scaling of LCDs, but is based on the unique characteristics of the OLED drivers. The proposed method saves wasted power in the driver transistor and the internal resistance with an amplitude modulation driver, and in the internal resistance with a pulse width modulation driver, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed OLED DVS with image compensation technique saves up to 52.5% of the OLED power while keeping the same human-perceived image quality for the Lena image.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981702","DVS;Image Processing;Low-Power Design;OLED","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Power demand;Pulse width modulation;Voltage control","LED displays;image resolution;organic light emitting diodes","DVS;LCD panel;OLED display;amplitude modulation driver;battery-operated device;driver transistor;dynamic voltage scaling;image compensation;internal resistance;liquid crystal display panel;movie players;panel luminance;photo viewers;pixel color;power consumption;power saving methods","","6","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This computational capacity was further fueled by the success of circuit and architecture-level innovation, which provided performance improvement in each processor generation. However, future processor designs face a number of key challenges in sustaining the growth trends. The dawn of the 22nm node, and beyond, marks an era of new trends and challenges; where the cost and complexity associated with each technology node is increasing at much faster rate than the device performance gains. Novel tools and design methodologies are needed to not only compensate for these challenges but also to leverage emerging technologies to achieve the desired performance in future processor architectures. Technology alternatives such as 3D integration have attracted significant interest as an additional way of sustaining the density scaling and performance growth. 3D integration provides some unique benefits for processor design, such as packaging density, interconnect bandwidth and latency, modularity, and heterogeneity. Packaging density improvement provided by 3D can be used to continue improvements in processing and storage capacity as well as enabling a gradual shift towards integrating the full system in one stack. Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) provide lower latency and higher bandwidth that improves interconnect-limited performance. 3D enables modular design of a variety of systems from a shared set of sub-components through functional separation of the device layers. As a result, different layers can be independently manufactured in the most cost effective ways, which can be stacked to compose a wide range of customized systems. Optimizing layer interfaces and infrastructure components, such as power delivery and clocking, can further enhance the inherent modularity advantages. 3D provides opportunities for composing future s- - ystems by integrating disparate technologies as well as different technology generations in the same stack. It can be used to incorporate a wide range of device layers including non-volatile memory layers, MEMS, FPGAs, DRAM or photonics in the same stack, easing the IO/off-chip bandwidth limitations. This provides the opportunity to enable processor architectures with new computation, storage and communication capabilities. The system-level benefits of 3D will be determined, to a significant degree, by the effectiveness of novel design methodologies that explore the new design space introduced by the vertical dimension. Design flow optimization is essential in achieving the highest performance gains as well as tackling the more prominent interdependencies among performance, power dissipation, temperatures, interconnectivity and reliability in 3D. This presentation will highlight these challenges and opportunities.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981937","3D Integration;3DI;Microprocessors","Bandwidth;Design methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance evaluation;Performance gain;Program processors;Three dimensional displays","electronics packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips;technology CAD (electronics);three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D integration;CAD;IO/off-chip bandwidth limitations;TSV;clocking;density scaling;interconnect bandwidth;interconnect-limited performance;nonvolatile memory layers;packaging density;performance growth;power delivery;processor design;technology scaling;through-silicon-vias","","1","","","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works such as simulation based estimation method or analytical method that focused on estimation of low level throughput in link layer are not adequate for accurately estimating throughput of the real silicon SoC because practical use cases of such complex connectivity blocks typically require extensive software operation on top of platform operating systems like Linux. FPGA-based emulation, therefore, is commonly used to verify functional correctness of complex connectivity blocks in a more realistic usage scenario with real connectivity devices like USB 2.0 mass storage devices. Speed of FPGA emulation, though, is scaled down significantly because of inherent limitation of FPGA emulation while speed of interface to real connectivity devices is required to be at-speed for compliance with connectivity specification standards. For this reason, scaling factors of speed are not uniform and, thus, measurement of performance is not accurate. This paper proposes a method to compensate errors due to the non-uniform scaling factors. In the proposed method, measurements of various parameters in FPGA emulation are applied to a high-accuracy estimation model that we created. Our method was applied to USB2.0, and the experimental result shows 4.1% of estimation error.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981858","Estimation;High-speed Connectivity;Throughput;USB2.0","Application specific integrated circuits;Estimation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Prefetching;Throughput;Universal Serial Bus","field programmable gate arrays;storage media;system-on-chip","FPGA-based emulation;USB 2.0 mass storage devices;emulation based high-accuracy throughput estimation;high-speed connectivity blocks;system-on-chip","","0","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A less universal, but still vexing, subtlety arises when an oscillator is described by a system of differential equations with “hidden” conservation constraints (HCC's); defined as weighted sums of state variables that are time-invariant. If there are HCC's, as is commonly the case for models of biochemical oscillators but rarely the case for practical circuit oscillators, the now-standard approach to computing parametric sensitivities can yield incorrect results. In addition, the monodromy matrix (the matrix of state sensitivities over one oscillation period), is often defective in a way that interferes with the usual approach to computing oscillator phase noise. In this paper we analyze the HCC case, and show that by augmenting the standard sensitivity approach with explicit HCC's, one can recover the correct parametric sensitivities. In addition, we prove that there is a typically satisfied condition that guarantees that a system with HCCs will have a defective monodromy matrix. A deliberately “flawed” ring oscillator circuit and a cyanobacterial circadian clock biochemical oscillator are used to demonstrate the parametric sensitivity problem and its resolution, and to show the issue of the defective monodromy matrix.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981872","biochemical kinetics;periodic steady-state;sensitivity analysis","Biological system modeling;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Orbits;Oscillators;Sensitivity","biochemistry;differential equations;matrix algebra;oscillators;sensitivity analysis","HCC;circuit oscillators;cyanobacterial circadian clock biochemical oscillator sensitivity analysis;defective monodromy matrix;differential equations;flawed ring oscillator circuit;hidden conservation constraints;oscillation period;oscillator phase noise;parametric sensitivity problem;state sensitivities","","0","","15","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method applies a graph-based symbolic analysis and affine interval arithmetic to derive the variational transfer functions of analog circuits (linearized) with variational coefficients in forms of intervals. Then the frequency response bounds (maximum and minimum) are obtained by performing analysis of a finite number of transfer functions given by the Kharitonov's polynomial functions. We show that symbolic de-cancellation is critical for the affine interval analysis. The response bound given by the Kharitonov's functions are conservative given the correlations among coefficient intervals in transfer functions.

The automotive industry has strong requirements with respect to safety and reliability; hence the introduction of new technologies is usually done in an evolutionary approach. This implies that for the introduction of Ethernet a gateway to currently existing automotive networking technologies is required for achieving a smooth migration. Within this paper a concept for such a gateway maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) offered by the existing automotive networks is proposed. In order to support the same level of QoS the usage of Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) is suggested. The implementation of such a QoS gateway is investigated specifically for the automotive networks MOST and FlexRay. For evaluation of the proposed concepts a validation system was built up, and promising results showing the feasibility of such a QoS gateway have been achieved.

As flash plays a more important role, data integrity in flash memories becomes a critical question. This paper examines one aspect of that data integrity by measuring the types of errors that occur when power fails during a flash memory operation. Our findings demonstrate that power failure can lead to several non-intuitive behaviors. We find that increasing the time before power failure does not always reduce error rates and that a power failure during a program operation can corrupt data that a previous, successful program operation wrote to the device. Our data also show that interrupted program operations leave data more susceptible to read disturb and increase the probability that the programmed data will decay over time. Finally, we show that incomplete erase operations make future program operations to the same block unreliable.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981701","flash memory;power failure;power loss","Ash;Bit error rate;Encoding;Programming;Reliability;Semiconductor device measurement","computer power supplies;data integrity;flash memories","computer systems;data integrity;flash memory;flash-based solid-state drives;interrupted program operations;mission-critical server systems;music players;power failure;power loss","","0","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the static power consumption of MCML standard cells is significantly higher compared to equivalent functions implemented using static CMOS logic. As a result, the use of such a logic style is very limited in portable devices. Paradoxically, these devices are the most sensitive to physical attacks, thus the ones which would benefit more from the adoption of MCML. We propose to overcome this limitation by reducing drastically the static power consumption of MCML-based cryptographic circuits. To this end, we designed Power Gated MCML (PG-MCML), a standard cell library featuring a sleep transistor in every cell. The effects of the sleep transistor on performance as well as on area are negligible. Moreover, the proposed differential library is supported by conventional EDA tools. We evaluated our standard cell library using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as benchmark and we compared the power consumption, the area, and the DPA-resistance figures with the ones of static CMOS and conventional MCML. Our results show that our PG-MCML library can achieve a power consumption comparable with the one of static CMOS, thus proving that PG-MCML cells can suit the strict power budget of battery operated devices.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982021","Current Mode Logic;DPA;Security;Side Channel Attacks","CMOS integrated circuits;Delay;Libraries;Logic gates;Power demand;Switching circuits;Transistors","CMOS logic circuits;cryptography;current-mode logic;power aware computing","CMOS logic;EDA tools;MCML-based cryptographic circuits;advanced encryption standard;power analysis attacks;power aware DPA-resistant standard cell library;power-gated MOS current mode logic;sleep transistor","","0","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optimal tradeoff can only be achieved by an improved prediction of the task execution times, prior to an efficient scheduling. Moreover, since the processor's soft error rate is a function of its operating voltage, it is also linked to the performance-power trade-off. The situation is further complicated for the case of multicore architectures where the tasks are to be mapped on separate cores (processing elements). This paper proposes a joint State-Space model to achieve improved task execution time estimation, leading to better scheduling for optimizing the trade-off, particularly in the context of multicore soft real-time systems. It does not assume any `a priori' knowledge about the task graph or its properties, and is independent of the underlying architecture. It learns the system dynamics over time. The state-space solution is formulated using a recursive implementation of the online Monte Carlo Method. Having obtained the estimates of the execution times, they are compensated for the soft error according to a given soft error rate. At the beginning of each scheduling interval, the low power EDF scheduling decision is carried out to execute the tasks. The proposed method (SEAL) achieves 29% better energy savings compared to state-of-the-art, while the deadline misses are under 7% without the loss of system failure probability. The results obtained clearly show the advantage in terms of energy savings.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981709","Monte Carlo;Multicore;Soft error;Software pipeline;Task-execution time;low-power scheduling","Decoding;Estimation;Mathematical model;Monte Carlo methods;Multicore processing;Scheduling;Seals","Monte Carlo methods;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;power consumption;scheduling","Monte Carlo state space;SEAL;joint state-space model;low power EDF scheduling;optimal tradeoff;power consumption;processors performance;soft error aware low power scheduling;stochastic spatial and temporal dependencies;task execution time estimation","","0","","23","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, this paper presents the first work to perform simultaneous functional and timing ECO. We use an augmented bipartite graph to model both types of ECO. In addition, through comprehensive constant insertion and bridging, the functional capability of each spare cell is enhanced, thus facilitating spare cell selection. Experimental results show that our simultaneous functional and timing ECO engine can successfully resolve mixed functional and timing ECO that is unsolvable by the sequential scheme.

One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually-compatible control signals. Prior works utilize this addressing scheme by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging. However, merging control signals also introduces redundant actuations, which potentially cause a high power-consumption problem. Recent studies on PDMFBs have indicated that high power consumption not only decreases the product lifetime but also degrades the system reliability. Unfortunately, this power-aware design concern is still not readily available among current design automations of PDMFBs. To cope with these issues, we propose in this paper the first power-aware broadcast addressing for PDMFBs. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and power-consumption minimization into consideration, thereby achieving higher integration and better design performance.

The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 3D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3D cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) 3D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs, (2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, 3D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2D routers since the physical positions of TSVs are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981862","3D ICs;Physical Design;Placement","Equations;Estimation error;Mathematical model;Routing;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","integrated circuit design;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC design;3D IC placement;3D analytical global placement;3D routing;TSV aware analytical placement;TSV aware legalization;density optimization;layer-by-layer detailed placement;log sum exp wirelength model;three dimensional integrated circuit;through silicon vias;weighted average wirelength model","","2","","19","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the multi-stage processing nature of advanced fast ME/DE schemes, a reduced-sized multi-bank on-chip memory is employed which can be power-gated depending upon the video properties. As a result, when tested for various video sequence, our approach provides a dynamic energy reduction of 82-96% for the off-chip memory and a leakage energy reduction of 57-75% for the on-chip memory compared to the Level-C and Level-C+ prefetching techniques (which are the prominent data reuse and prefetching techniques in ME for video coding). The proposed ME/DE architecture is synthesized using a 65nm IBM low power technology.

Existing convex programming based methods are too expensive and thus are ruled out for realistic application. Other methods based on iteratively fixing the passivity through perturbing the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix either suffer from convergence issue or lack optimality which will sometimes lead to unacceptable error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for macro-modeling. In addition to the traditional two-stage (fixing plus enforcement) schemes, we propose a post-enforcement optimization, which takes a passive, while potentially not-so-accurate model, as the starting point, and performs local search to find the local optimum with passivity constraint or build-in passivity guarantee. A simple yet stable passive modeling generator is proposed to produce the starting model for optimization. Two algorithms are proposed for performing constrained and unconstrained optimizations. Experiments show that the accuracy of passivity-fixed model can be significantly improved with the proposed methods.The main problems of such algorithms are 1) The perturbation process does not guarantee convergence. Each step of perturbation, though will move some imaginary eigenvalues away from the axis, will potentially move other eigenvalues to the imaginary axis and thus introduce new passivity violations. 2) Even if the enforcement procedure stops with a passive model, the error could be large. This is because each step of the enforcement is aiming at minimizing the perturbation instead of minimizing the model error. After a few steps of iterations, the model error will generally be accumulated, and eventually it could be quite large. In this paper we propose to perform an additional refinement step to improve the accuracy of a passive model while still guarantee the passivity. The input to the proposed algorithms is a passive, while not-so-accurate starti- - ng model. This is different from existing passivity enforcement schemes, in which the input is an accurate, but not passive system. The starting passive model can be provided with any of the existing enforcement techniques, or with some simpler (and more stable) approaches that will be introduced later. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the mathematical background of the problem, and review exiting methods for passivity constrained macro-modeling. Section 3 presents the framework for the proposed three-stage passive macro-modeling. Section 4 and 5 presents two schemes for post enforcement optimization. Results and conclusions will be given in Sections 6 and 7.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981975","Macro modeling;optimization;passivity;vector fitting","Accuracy;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Optimization;Programming;Transfer functions","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling","convex programming based methods;passive macro-modeling;passive modeling generator;passivity enforcement;post-enforcement optimization","","0","","14","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a trade-off between subthreshold leakage power consumption and clock frequency in the circuit; i.e., for higher performance, leakage power consumption must be sacrificed and vice versa. Meanwhile, timing analysis during synthesis and physical design is pessimistic, which means there are some slacks available to be traded for leakage power minimization. This power minimization can be done after the sign-off which is more accurate and realistic than if it is done before the sign-off. The available slack can be traded for leakage power minimization by footprint-based cell swapping and threshold voltage assignment. In this paper, we introduce our post sign-off leakage power optimization problem as a nonlinear mathematical program and solve it by using conjugate gradient (CG) method. We set up a novel transformation technique to manipulate the constraints of the optimization problem to be solved by CG. We show that by doing this optimization we can reduce the leakage power consumption by 34% on average in comparison with no power optimization after sign-off.

However, systematic and random mismatches will affect the accuracy of the capacitance ratios. A common-centroid placement is helpful to reduce the systematic mismatch, but it still needs the property of high dispersion to reduce the random mismatch. To deal with this problem, we propose a simulated annealing based approach to construct a common-centroid placement which exhibits the highest possible degree of dispersion. To facilitate this framework, we first propose the pair-sequence representation to represent a common-centroid placement. Then, we present three operations to perturb the representation, which can increase the degree of dispersion without breaking the common-centroid constraint in the resulting placement. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of our simulated annealing based approach, we propose three techniques to speed up our program. The experimental results show that our placements can simultaneously achieve smaller oxide-gradient-induced mismatch and larger overall correlation coefficients (i.e., higher degree of dispersion) than in all test cases. Besides, our program can run much faster than in larger benchmarks.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981853","Analog placement;capacitor array","Arrays;Capacitors;Correlation;Dispersion;Layout;Symmetric matrices;Systematics","analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","analog integrated circuit;analog layout phase;capacitance ratios;common centroid capacitor placement;common centroid constraint;common centroid placement;oxide gradient induced mismatch;pair sequence representation;random mismatche;simulated annealing;systematic mismatch reduction","","3","","15","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, transistor counts are scaling up, enabling the design of highly integrated chips with many cores and a complex interconnect fabric, often a network on chip (NoC). Particularly problematic is the case when the accumulation of permanent hardware faults leads to disconnected cores in the system. In order to maintain correct system operation, it is necessary to salvage the data from these isolated nodes. In this work, we introduce a recovery mechanism targeting precisely this issue: DRAIN (Distributed Recovery Architecture for Inaccessible Nodes) provides system-level recovery from permanent failures. When an error disconnects a node from the network, DRAIN uses emergency links to transfer architectural state and cached data from disconnected nodes to nearby connected caches. DRAIN incurs zero performance penalty during normal operation, and is compatible with any cache coherence protocol, interconnect topology or routing protocol. Experimental results show that DRAIN is able to provide complete state recovery within several milliseconds, on average, for a 1GHz 64-node CMP at an area overhead of only a few thousand gates.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981885","Fault-Tolerance;Network-on-Chip;Recovery;Resilient Systems","Hardware;Logic gates;Network topology;Radiation detectors;Reliability;Routing;Topology","computer architecture;fault tolerant computing;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","1GHz 64-node CMP;DRAIN;Distributed Recovery Architecture for Inaccessible Nodes;cache coherence protocol;distributed recovery architecture;multicore chip;network on chip;recovery mechanism;routing protocol;silicon reliability;system level recovery;transfer architectural state;zero performance penalty","","5","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, while searching for a valid implementation a substantial amount of time is spent on timing analysis during system synthesis. This paper presents a novel system synthesis approach that efficiently prunes the search space in case real-time constraints are violated. For this purpose, the reason for a constraint violation is analyzed and a deduced encoding removes it permanently from the search space. Thus, the approach is capable of proving both the presence and absence of a correct implementation. The key benefit of the proposed approach stems from its integral support for real-time constraint checking. Its efficiency, however, results from the power of deduction techniques of state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Using a case study from the automotive domain, experiments show that the proposed system synthesis approach is able to find valid implementations where former approaches fail. Moreover, it is up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a state-of-the-art approach.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981813","Algorithms;Design","Decision trees;Encoding;Real time systems;Resource management;Routing;Schedules;Timing","computability;search problems;timing","Boolean satisfiability solvers;stringent real-time constraints;symbolic system synthesis;timing analysis","","2","","12","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wear leveling techniques were proposed to extend its lifetime by balancing writes traffic. Another important concern that need to be considered is endurance variation in PRAM chips. When different PRAM cells have distinct endurance, balanced writes will result in lifetime degradation due to the weakest cells. Instead of balancing writes traffic, in this paper we propose wear rate leveling (WRL), a variant of wear leveling, to balance wear rates (i.e., writes traffic/edudrance) of cells across the PRAM chip. After investigating writing behavior of applications and endurance variation, we propose an architecture-level WRL mechanism. Moreover, there is an important tradeoff between endurance improvement and swapping data volume. To co-optimize endurance and swapping, a novel algorithm, Max Hyper-weight Rematching, is proposed to maximize PRAM lifetime and minimize performance degradation. Experimental results show 19x endurance improvement to prior Wear Leveling.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982017","PRAM endurance;wear leveling;wear rate leveling","Complexity theory;Degradation;Phase change random access memory;Prediction algorithms;Programming;Systematics;Writing","phase change memories;wear","PRAM lifetime enhancement;PRAM-based main memory;architecture-level WRL mechanism;endurance variation;max hyper-weight rematching algorithm;phase change random access memory;wear rate leveling techniques","","2","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lacking a reconfigurable platform, analog designers are denied the benefits of rapid prototyping, hardware emulation, and smooth migration to advanced technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new approach that maps any AMS design problem to a transistor-level reconfigurable vehicle, thus enabling fast validation and a reduction in post-Silicon bugs, and minimizing design risk and costs. The unique features of the approach include: (1) transistor-level programmability that emulates each transistor behavior in an analog design, reproducing the system and achieving very fine granularity of reconfiguration; (2) programmable switches that are treated as a design component during analog transistor mapping, and optimized with the reconfiguration matrix; (3) parasitics reduction that leverages the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology. Based on these principles, a digitally controlled PANDA platform is designed at a 32nm node. Several 90nm analog blocks are successfully emulated with the 32nm platform, including a folded-cascode operational amplifier, a sample-and-hold module (S/H), and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).

This work presents and discusses gridless pin access. In particular, we show how to create a feasible and efficient gridless routing approach that can be fit into existing gridded routing flows, creating a practical overall routing solution. As a key ingredient, our approach explicitly ad dresses design rule conform (shortest) paths among geometric obstacles, also taking violations within the paths them selves into consideration.

We propose GPU-friendly data structures and SIMD parallel algorithm flows to facilitate the FMM-based 3-D capacitance extraction on GPU.

Our experimental results show that FMMGpu brings 22X to 30X speedups in capacitance extractions for various test cases.

In this paper, we present a novel energy optimization technique which employs both dynamic reconfiguration of private caches and partitioning of the shared cache for multicore systems with real-time tasks. Our static profiling based algorithm is designed to judiciously find beneficial cache configurations (of private caches) for each task as well as partition factors (of the shared cache) for each core so that the energy consumption is minimized while task deadline is satisfied.

This paper shows that in statistical path selection, this is not only the case, but also the quality of results can be severely degraded even after the iteration. To deal with this issue, we consider testability in the first place by integrating a SAT solver, and this necessitates a new statistical path selection method.

We propose an approach to correct the grid, in case some voltage drops violate the threshold condition, by making minor changes to the original design. Previous work has been done in on the DC model of the grid and this paper deals with the transient model. Rather than directly reducing the steady state voltage drops below the threshold we work on reducing the first time step voltage drops. The method uses current constraints proposed in to find the first time step voltage drop whose distance to the corresponding threshold is the largest. It then tries to estimate it as a function of the metal widths on the grid. A non-linear optimization problem is then formulated and the required metal line width changes that reduce the first time step voltage drops by a sufficient amount are then determined. The reduction of the first time step voltage drop by that amount will make the steady state voltage drops of all the nodes less than the threshold.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981989","Power Grid;sensitivity;voltage drop","Metals;Power grids;Robustness;Safety;Steady-state;Threshold voltage;Upper bound","nonlinear programming;power grids;sensitivity analysis","RC model;nonlinear optimization problem;power grid correction;sensitivity analysis;transient model","","0","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Towards this goal, an efficient statistical algorithm is derived to efficiently estimate the information density and then optimize the memory system for maximum-information storage.

Canonicity enables efficiency of manipulation but comes at the cost of fixing a variable evaluation order and predictably, BDD sizes are very sensitive to the selected order. The state-of-the-art reordering algorithms are based on transpositions of consecutive variables (swaps). Exact algorithms enumerate all possible n! permutations by performing a series of at least n! - 1 swaps, while heuristics typically either search for the optimum location of each variable independently (sifting) or utilize exact algorithms as a subroutine (k-window.) In this work we reduce the problem of variable ordering to that of obtaining a permutation enumeration transposition network. Our proposed network avoids traversing all n! permutations by exploiting structural properties of BDDs and requires the execution of fewer than 4<sup>n</sup> swaps sequentially instead of n! - 1. For the practically interesting cases of n = 4; 5 our algorithm requires only 11 (resp 59) sequential swaps instead of 23 (resp 119). We also propose an algorithm for moving between arbitrary variable orderings that executes at most n swaps sequentially, an improvement upon equation.

In general, KPNs are difficult to analyze at design-time. Thus a special case of the KPN model, called Polyhedral Process Networks (PPN), has been proposed to address the analyzability issue. However, the PPN model is not able to capture adaptive/dynamic behavior. Such behavior is usually expressed by using parameters which values are reconfigured at run-time. To model the adaptive/dynamic applications, in this paper we introduce an extension of the PPN model, called Parameterized Polyhedral Process Networks (P<sup>3</sup>N), which still provides design-time analyzability to some extent. We first formally define the P<sup>3</sup>N model and its operational semantics. In addition, we devise a design-time analysis to extract relations between parameters. Based on the analysis, we propose an approach to ensure that consistent execution of the P<sup>3</sup>N model is preserved at run-time.

The analysis and design of such shapers allows for dynamically variable streams of jobs; for instance, periodic streams with jitter.

Post-silicon power modeling is an essential step for design validation and for building trustable pre-silicon power models and analyses. One popular approach for devising post-silicon power estimates is to translate the thermal emissions from the backside of the die into power estimates. Such approach faces a major physical challenge arising from spatial heat diffusion which blurs the resultant thermal images. The objective of this paper is to improve post-silicon power mapping by utilizing lock-in thermography techniques where AC signals, rather than DC signals, are used to excite the circuit blocks. We prove and demonstrate that using AC excitation sources reduces the extent of spatial heat diffusion. We devise a lock-in based thermal to power inversion methodology that maps spatial power consumption on a real chip. Using a custom test chip, we are to able to scientifically quantify and validate the improvements in power mapping attained from the proposed techniques.

The proposed approach is based on Interval Property Checking (IPC) that has proved successful on large industrial hardware designs. In this paper, IPC is extended by a specific abstraction technique that makes it tractable for hardware/ software co-verification on realistic industrial designs. In the proposed methodology sets of finite state sequences of the system are abstracted by interval properties. This allows us to handle long sequences of state transitions in the hardware as they occur when running programs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the example of an industrial LIN software running on a public domain microprocessor platform.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981972","Abstraction;Embedded System;Formal Verification;Hardware/Software","Computational modeling;Concrete;Embedded systems;Hardware;Integrated circuit modeling;Random access memory","embedded systems;formal verification","abstraction technique;embedded systems;finite state sequences;formal hardware-software coverification;industrial LIN software;interval property checking;microprocessor platform","","2","","18","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Lithography at 14nm and beyond: Choices and challenges","Singh, Vivek","Intel Corp. (USA), Hillsboro, OR, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","459","459","As the gap between the lithography wavelength and critical feature size has continued to increase, the semiconductor industry has had to adjust. Previously, scaling along Moore's Law had relied on improvement in lithography equipment, occasionally by reducing the wavelength and frequently by improving the effective numerical aperture. The wavelength used to define critical dimensions during much of the nineties was 248nm, with the industry switching to 193nm in the following decade. After 157nm technology failed to materialize due to technological challenges, the focus of next generation lithography (NGL) research shifted to EUV. Meanwhile, 193nm continued to be the workhorse for the continuation of Moore's Law. The next big equipment advancement came with immersion steppers, which “increased” the effective aperture of the lens, thereby capturing more of the diffraction orders in the imaging process. Moore's Law, however requires a significant innovation every two years! With optical lithography wavelength and effective lens aperture stretched to these limits, double patterning came to the rescue. By splitting the pattern into two, the burden on each mask was somewhat reduced, allowing a “stitched” pattern to scale. All through these changes, continued scaling also required a tighter co-optimization between process and design. As the image quality became generally weaker, greater restrictions were placed on the diversity of features that could be robustly patterned, leading to the proverbial increase in the heft of design rule manuals. All through these heroic efforts to continue Moore's Law, in order to reap the resulting benefits to the electronics industry, a relatively new field called Computational Lithography has been providing a helping hand. Computational Lithography comprises a broad set of techniques that use physics-based calculations to eke out greater lithographic performance from a given generation of steppers. This- fertile field has recently introduced two advanced features: inverse lithography, and source-mask optimization. Such techniques have helped extend the life of optical lithography beyond previously forecast durations. At the same time, as other lithography technologies become more mature, much of the computational infrastructure developed to extend optical lithography will likely be used to optimize the newer technologies. This paper will provide some examples of how Computational Lithography is creating novel and affordable solutions to sustain the scaling trend.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981847","Lithography","Apertures;Electronics industry;Lithography;Optical imaging","lithography;semiconductor industry","Computational Lithography;EUV;Moore law;NGL;next generation optical lithography wavelength;physics-based calculations;semiconductor industry;size 14 nm;source-mask optimization","","0","","","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, power gating introduces unique power delivery integrity issues and tradeoffs between switching and rush current (wake-up) supply noises. In addition, in power-gated power delivery networks (PDNs), the amount of power saving intrinsically trades off with power integrity. In this paper, we propose systemic decoupling capacitance optimization strategies that optimally balance between switching and rush current noises, and tradeoff between power integrity and wake-up time, hence power saving. Furthermore, we propose a novel re-routable decoupling capacitance concept to break the tight interaction between power integrity and power saving, providing further improved tradeoffs between the two.

SADP is in production use for 1D patterns in NAND Flash memory applications but applying SADP to 2D random logic patterns is challenging. In this paper, we describe the first layout decomposition methods of SADP lithography for complex 2D layouts. The favored type of SADP for complex logic interconnects is a two mask approach using a core (mandrel) mask and a trim mask. This paper describes methods for automatically choosing and optimizing the manufacturability of base core mask patterns, generating assist core patterns, and optimizing trim mask patterns to accomplish high quality layout decomposition in SADP process. We evaluate our technique on 22nm node industrial standard cells and logic designs. Experimental results show that our proposed layout decomposition for SADP effectively decomposes many challenging 2D layouts.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981871","DFM;Decomposition;Double patterning;Lithography;SADP","Color;Layout;Lithography;Merging;Metals;Shape","NAND circuits;flash memories;lithography","LELE process;NAND flash memory applications;SADP;base core mask patterns;complex logic interconnects;core mask;flexible 2D layout decomposition framework;litho-etch-litho-etch processes;pitch-splitting sidewall image method;size 30 nm;spacer-type self-aligned double pattering lithography;trim mask","","1","1","14","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Dynamic effort scaling: Managing the quality-efficiency tradeoff","Chippa, V.; Raghunathan, A.; Roy, K.; Chakradhar, S.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

Hardware and software systems that are thus designed may be viewed as “scalable effort systems”, since they offer the capability to modulate the effort that they expend towards computation, thereby allowing for tradeoffs between output quality and efficiency. We propose the concept of Dynamic Effort Scaling (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach - statically setting the scaling mechanisms leads to either significant error overshoot or significant opportunities for energy savings left on the table unexploited. In contrast, DES is able to effectively regulate the output quality while maximally exploiting the time-varying resiliency in the workload.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981982","Approximate Computing;Dynamic Effort Scaling;Low Power Design;Mining;Recognition;Scalable Effort;Support Vector Machines","Computer architecture;Hardware;Latches;Resilience;Sensors;Support vector machines;Voltage control","circuit feedback;microprocessor chips;scaling circuits;support vector machines","control knobs;dynamic effort scaling;dynamic management;error overshoot;feedback control problem;gardware systems;inherent error resilience;quality-efficiency tradeoff;scalable effort systems;scalable-effort processor;scaling mechanisms;software systems;support vector machines;time-varying resiliency","","3","","26","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is mainly because low Vcc incurs process variation-induced bit errors in large SRAM in cache. Existing approaches for low Vcc cache suffer from low performance due to reduced effective capacity, long latency to correct errors, and increased misses due to accesses to faulty words. In our work, we propose a word-level sub-block disable-based method which increases the utilization of available cache capacity. Our key idea is to minimize accesses to faulty words. To do that, we propose utilizing access behavior history in allocating cache resource with faulty words. In addition, we propose remapping cache words inside of cache line in order to better match both access and error patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives average 21.8% (up to 34.0%) performance improvement with a small area overhead in L1 and L2 caches.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982018","Cache;Vccmin;access pattern;bit error","Art;Error analysis;Error correction;Error correction codes;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Sensitivity analysis","SRAM chips;cache storage;resource allocation","SRAM;V<sub>cc</sub> L1 cache;bit error pattern;cache access behavior matching;cache resource allocation;process variation-induced bit errors;supply voltage;word-level sub-block disable-based method","","1","","19","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
