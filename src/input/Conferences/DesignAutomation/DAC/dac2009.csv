"System-level cost analysis and design exploration for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs)","Xiangyu Dong; Yuan Xie","Comput. Sci. & Eng.

The majority of the existing 3D IC research is focused on how to take advantage of the performance, power, smaller form-factor, and heterogeneous integration benefits that offered by 3D integration. However, all such advantages ultimately have to translate into cost savings when a design strategy has to be decided: Is 3D integration a cost effective technology for a particular IC design? Consequently, system-level cost analysis at the early design stage is imperative to help the decision making on whether 3D integration should be adopted. In this paper, we study the design estimation method for 3D ICs at the early design stage, and propose a cost analysis model to study the cost implication for 3D ICs, and address the following cost-related problems related to 3D IC design: (1) Do all the benefits of 3D IC design come with a much higher cost? (2) How can 3D integration be achieved in a cost-effective way? (3) Are there any design options to compensate the extra 3D bonding cost? A cost-driven 3D IC design flow is also proposed to guide the design space exploration for 3D ICs toward a cost-effective direction.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796486","","Bonding;CMOS technology;Computer science;Costs;Decision making;Design engineering;Design methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Through-silicon vias","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","3D bonding cost;3D-IC design estimation method;interconnect scaling;system-level cost analysis;system-level design exploration;three-dimensional integrated circuits","","48","","25","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that converts this problem to a less challenging design quality measuring problem. Our approach is based on information hiding and constraint manipulation of the original system design specification. We lay out the basic requirements for our approach and demonstrate it through the popular graph coloring problem.

It provides desirable memory attributes such as fast access time, low cost, high density and non-volatility. However, variations in process parameters can lead to a large number of cells to fail, severely affecting the yield of the memory array. In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the impact of design parameters on parametric failures due to process variations. To achieve high memory yield without incurring expensive technology modification, we developed an alternate design paradigm -circuit/architecture co-design - to take advantage of different levels of design hierarchy (circuit and architecture) to improve the yield and memory density. The technique decouples the conflicting design requirements for read stability/writability and density. Consequently, the memory cell failure probability reduces by 48% and cell area reduces by 21% with negligible performance degradation (~0.4%).","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796585","","CMOS technology;Circuit stability;Costs;Design engineering;Failure analysis;Magnetic circuits;Magnetic tunneling;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Robustness","MRAM devices;integrated circuit design","design paradigm;fast access time;memory array;memory cell failure probability;memory density;parametric failures;spin-torque transfer magnetic RAM","","4","3","12","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These difficulties are primarily attributable to the increase in process variability that is incurred while aggressively scaling technology nodes which are based on the same fundamental device architectures and process solutions. The introduction of a metal gate/high-K (MGHK) stack at the 32/28 nm technology node will help in addressing the random variations due to random dopant fluctuations (RDF), but its benefit will be exhausted after a single process generation. As a result, for the 22/20 nm technology nodes, the only hope to limit RDF will be to adopt novel device architecture, such as FinFET and ultra thin body or fully depleted SOI, that would reduce the dopant concentration in the channel. Moreover, the inability to scale the wavelength of the light source used for lithography has led to a rapid increase of process and design costs. In particular, the lack of progress in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) will result in the need to define 22 nm technology node using expensive double patterning technologies (DPT) for critical layers. As a result, complex DFM flows have been proposed as an attempt to model various printability and layout dependent effects; however, the increase in design flow complexities, lack of accuracy, and the tremendous expense of maintaining updated models required for these methods has marred their adoption.We will show how template-based design methodology can enable future technology nodes that can utilize current generation lithography while minimizing the cost per good die. In particular, we will: discuss the choices of regular design fabrics and their implications on design metrics, such as power, area, and performance, resulting yields, and overall cost; show that the selection of circuit topologies can be mapped efficiently to the choice of reg- ular design fabric; and compare lithography solutions such as DPT, direct write multi-e-beam (MEBM), and interference lithography (IL) for the 22 nm technology node and beyond.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227193","DFM;design technology co-optimization;regular fabric;templates","Costs;Fabrics;Fluctuations;High K dielectric materials;High-K gate dielectrics;Lithography;Production;Resource description framework;Time to market;Ultraviolet sources","high-k dielectric thin films;integrated circuit design;ultraviolet lithography","FinFET;SOI;advanced technology node;aggressive scaling technology node;design-lithography cooptimization;double patterning technologies;extreme ultraviolet lithography;interference lithography;metal gate-high-K stack;multie-beam lithography;random dopant fluctuation;size 20 nm;size 22 nm;size 28 nm;size 32 nm;template-based design methodology","","0","","3","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The methodology is in two separate phases: the first phase, uses a heuristic to rapidly search through a large number of processor configurations (configurations differ by the base processor, the additional instructions and cache sizes) to find the near Pareto front; the second phase, utilizes either the above heuristic or an ILP (integer linear programming) formulation to search a smaller design space to find an appropriate final implementation. By the utilization of the fast heuristic with differing runtime constraints in the first phase, we rapidly find the near Pareto front. The second phase provides either an optimal or a near optimal solution. Both the ILP formulation and the heuristic find a system with the smallest area, within a designer specified runtime constraint. The system has efficiently explored design spaces with over 10<sup>12</sup> design points. We integrated this design methodology into a commercial design flow and evaluated our approach with different benchmarks (JPEG encoder, JPEG decoder and MP3 encoder). For each benchmark, the near Pareto front was found in a few hours using the heuristic (took several days for the ILP). The results show that the average area error of the heuristic is within 2.5% of the optimal design points (obtained using ILP) for all benchmarks.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227157","Design Space Exploration;Integer Linear Programming;MPSoCs","Application software;Application specific processors;Design methodology;Integer linear programming;Java;Multiprocessing systems;Pipeline processing;Runtime;Scheduling;Space exploration","Pareto optimisation;integer programming;linear programming;multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing","JPEG decoder;JPEG encoder;MP3 encoder;Pareto front;application specific heterogeneous pipelined multiprocessor systems;integer linear programming;processor configurations","","2","","21","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Convergence of product features brings unprecedented complexities on process technology, architectural and gate-count. Integration and cost drivers bring 3-D stacking with through-silicon vias. Heterogeneity brings high-voltage devices, image sensors, and MEMS into a single product design optimization. From IP migration, to variability modeling and mitigation, to NRE cost, the new paradigm is that these are no longer discrete issues addressable by point-tool solutions. Overcoming this new design complexity barrier requires breakthrough technologies and integrated EDA solutions. Funding the development of new EDA solutions must make business sense. But while traditional ROI assessments are based on âone company-centricâ business models, the next stage of the industry's evolution requires ROI and business models that acknowledge coexistence, and even collaboration, of multiple companies.

Our proposed approach mathematically formulates a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem for corner extraction. Next, it applies the Lagrange duality theory to convert the non-convex QCQP problem to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem that is easier to solve. Our circuit example designed in a commercial CMOS process demonstrates that the proposed SDP formulation can find the worst-case corners both efficiently and robustly, while the traditional QCQP fails to achieve global convergence.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227114","Integrated Circuit;Process Variation;Worst-Case Corner","Debugging;Graphics;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit synthesis;Lagrangian functions;Permission;Quadratic programming;Response surface methodology;Robustness;Statistical analysis","CMOS integrated circuits;convex programming;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit design;nanoelectronics;quadratic programming;statistical analysis","CMOS process;Lagrange duality theory;circuit debugging diagnosis;circuit failure diagnosis;convex semidefinite programming;corner extraction;design-specific worst-case corner extraction;design-specific worst-case corners;integrated circuit design;nanoscale integrated circuit design;nonconvex QCQP problem;quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem;statistical analysis","","0","","15","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To satisfy given specifications in the analog design, including low power and small area, designers have to select an optimal solution among large combination of the following alternatives: which architecture should be adopted; what type of transistors should be taken; and whether digitally assisting technologies should be used or not, etc. A design based on experience and intuition cannot lead to the optimum in a short time. A comprehensive approach to the optimization, based on circuit theory, is now required. Convex optimization procedure can solve the formulae which represent circuit performance with over hundreds of design variables. We have constructed optimization environments for pipelined and delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in consideration of the digitally assisting techniques and layout constraints. Both 12-bit pipelined ADCs and a 5th-order delta-sigma modulator were designed with the optimizer, and achieved top-ranked power efficiency.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796560","","Analog circuits;Analog-digital conversion;Circuit optimization;Circuit theory;Constraint optimization;Costs;Design methodology;Design optimization;Digital circuits;Pipelines","large scale integration;network synthesis;optimisation;sigma-delta modulation","analog circuits;analog-to-digital converters;convex optimization;cost reduction;delta-sigma A-to-D converters;delta-sigma modulators;layout constraints;pipeline converters;transistors","","2","","27","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To make the biochip feasible for practical applications, pin-count reduction is a key problem to higher-level integration of reactions on a biochip. Most previous works approach the problem by post-processing the placement and routing solutions to share compatible control signals; however, the quality of such sharing algorithms is inevitably limited by the placement and routing solutions. We present in this paper a comprehensive pin-constrained biochip design flow that addresses the pin-count issue at all design stages. The proposed flow consists of three major stages: (1) pin-count aware stage assignment that partitions the reactions in the given bioassay into execution stages, (2) pin-count aware device assignment that determines a specific device used for each reaction, and (3) guided placement, routing, and pin assignment that utilize the pin-count saving properties from the stage and device assignments to optimize the assay time and pin count. For both the stage and device assignments, exact ILP formulations and effective solution-space reduction schemes are proposed to minimize the assay time and pin count. Experimental results show the efficiency of our algorithms/flow and a 55-57% pin-count reduction over the state-of-the-art algorithms/flow.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227154","Microfludics;biochip;design methodology;integer linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic control;Design methodology;Electrodes;Immune system;Laboratories;Microfluidics;Permission;Pins;Routing","lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics","ILP-based pin-count aware design methodology;digital microfluidic biochips;pin-constrained biochip design;pin-count reduction","","9","","18","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Efficient design of the MIMO detector is a challenging task. This is further compounded by the fact that 802.11n standard requires support for runtime switching between different modulation schemes (or modes). While searching for an appropriate architecture attention must be paid to application requirements such as required throughput, limits on latency, and reconfiguration between various modes of operations. Important hardware design metrics such as area/power should be optimized over all the operating modes of the detector. In this paper we carry out extensive architectural space exploration to address the issues of power consumption, area, and reconfigurability between different modes of operation while meeting the standards throughput requirement. Ultimately, we come up with two designs that target low area and low power respectively. We also maintain close to optimum bit error rate(BER), which is vital for any wireless system.

These trace signals need to be transferred to on-chip buffers and/or off-chip trace ports for analysis. Existing solutions use multiplexer trees or specific access networks to conduct the above duty, which, however, either provide less visibility to the CUD or result in high hardware cost.

Before engineering change order (ECO) is applied, these cells are pre-placed as decoupling capacitors. When ECO is applied, these cells are configured as functional cells. To demonstrate the efficiency of our configurable cell, we propose an algorithm for timing closure and IR drop minimization. Compared with traditional ECO flow, our method shows 16% reduction in maximum IR drop and 56% reduction in leakage before applying ECO, and 8% reduction in maximum IR drop after applying ECO, with 10% area of spare cells. In addition, we show that there are less unsolved ECO timing paths left after applying our ECO timing optimization algorithm due to free selection of ECO gate type.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227112","Decoupling Capacitor;ECO;IR Drop;Spare Cell","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitance;Capacitors;Computer science;Design engineering;Hardware;Minimization methods;Permission;Timing;Voltage","integrated circuit layout","ECO design flow;ECO timing optimization algorithm;IR drop minimization;decoupling capacitance;engineering change order;spare cell design","","2","1","12","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multiplier is optimized further to perform the accumulation of partial products by the T flip flops of the output register without XOR gates. It is interesting to note that the optimized structure consists of an array of (m+1) AND gates between an array of (m+1) D flip flops and an array of (m+1) T flip flops. The proposed structure therefore involves significantly less area and less computation time compared with the corresponding existing structures.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796482","","Design engineering;Design optimization;Digital arithmetic;Elliptic curve cryptography;Galois fields;Hardware;Logic;Polynomials;Registers;Throughput","computational complexity;flip-flops;logic gates;multiplying circuits;polynomials;recursive estimation","AND gates;D flip flops;T flip flops;XOR gates;all-one polynomials;localized bit-level dependence graph;multiplier circuit;recursive algorithm;serial-in parallel-out shift-register;serial-parallel finite field multiplication","","0","","21","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this new type of memory devices raises questions regarding how to test their correct operation. In particular, the variability affecting the decoder is expected to make very complex the test of these new devices. In this paper we present a method to simplify the test of these new devices by using a current thresholder to detect badly addressed nanowires. In the proposed method, the thresholder design is based on a stochastic and perturbative model of the current through the nanowires. Thus, the calculated thresholder parameters are robust against technology variation. As our experimental results indicate, the thresholder error probability is initially only ~10<sup>-4</sup>, which can be also reduced further (up to ~60times) by trading-off only ~35% area overhead in the memory.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796584","","Bridge circuits;Decoding;Error probability;Logic circuits;Nanoscale devices;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance;Switches;Switching circuits;Testing","amplifiers;integrated memory circuits;nanoelectronics;nanowires;semiconductor device testing;stochastic processes","defect-aware thresholder;nanoscale memory devices;nanowire crossbars;sense amplifier;stochastic perturbative approach","","0","","24","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous analog behavior modeling approaches often treat the noisy V<sub>DD</sub> waveform as a given input and focus on reflecting such stimuli on circuit performance. However, because the interaction of noise aggressors and victims is not considered, some errors may exist in the simulation. In this paper, a simple SCORE macromodel is proposed for PLL designs. It can be integrated with a supply-noise-aware PLL behavioral model to analyze supply noise effects at high level. In addition to numerical results, the time-varying supply noise waveform and real-time PLL responses can be obtained simultaneously. As demonstrated in the experimental results, the proposed approach can provide more realistic simulation results with noise interaction effects but still keep fast simulation time.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796532","","Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Digital circuits;Noise level;Packaging;Performance analysis;Phase locked loops;Power supplies;Power system modeling","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise;phase locked loops;system-on-chip","SCORE macromodel;SOC designs;noise interaction effects;real-time PLL responses;supply-noise-aware PLL behavioral model;time-varying supply noise waveform","","0","","24","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents four new fault models and the testing of retention flip-flop. The four fault models are awake-mode stuck-at fault, sleep-mode stuck-at fault, awake-mode transition fault, and sleep-mode transition fault. The four faults model the defects that affect the retained value, wakeup time, and sleep time of retention flip-flops. Based on the new fault models, test patterns for retention flip-flop can be easily generated by current automatic test pattern generation tools. The proposed test methodology is validated by performing experiments on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits and some realistic industrial low power designs. The experimental results show that the faults of retention flip-flops can be easily detected by our method and the average fault coverage is higher than 98%. The fault coverage of conventional single stuck-at fault and transition fault test can be increased by more than 1%.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796559","","Automatic test pattern generation;Automatic testing;Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Flip-flops;Performance evaluation;Test pattern generators","fault diagnosis;flip-flops;logic design;logic testing;low-power electronics","automatic test pattern generation tools;awake-mode transition fault;fault modeling;low power circuits;low power designs;retention flip-flop testing;sleep-mode stuck-at fault;sleep-mode transition fault;test methodologies","","1","1","9","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is exemplified with an state-of-the-art transaction level (TL) model used for firmware development of a productive wireless communication chip. By discussing the strengths and shortcomings of TL modeling we derive a set of requirements for a future modeling paradigm, which led to the new data flow abstraction approach presented in this paper.

Therefore, timed simulation is significantly slower than un-timed simulation. By simply adding delays in the components and communication channels, our timed MPEG-2 decoder simulates more than 14 times slower than an un-timed simulation. In this paper, we propose a partial order method to speed up timed simulation by relaxing the order that the components are simulated. With partial order method, a component is not required to schedule a channel access if both behavioral and timing results of the access are known. The simulation switches less frequently hence the simulation overhead reduces. We show that partial order method can be used in complex system-level simulation such as MPSoC implementations of the MPEG-2 decoder. In our experiments, partial order method provides more than 10 times speedups over regular discrete event simulation for timed simulation.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796472","","Clocks;Communication switching;Computational modeling;Decoding;Delay;Discrete event simulation;Space exploration;Switches;System-level design;Timing","system-on-chip","MPEG-2 decoder;complex system-level simulation;current discrete event simulator;multiprocessor system-on-a-chip;partial order method;system-level MPSoC designs;timed simulation","","0","","18","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Utilizing the active memory operation, we can replace multiple transactions of memory accesses over the on-chip network and related local processing element computation with a smaller number of high-level transactions and near-memory computation. We implemented a processor called active memory processor which is located near the memory and executes the active memory operations. In our case studies, we applied the concept to three real-world applications (parallelized JPEG, FFT, and text indexing for data mining) running on a 36-tile architecture with 32 cores and 4 memories and found that the programmable transaction approach can improve performance by 34.3% to 618% at the cost of additional design effort.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227056","Computer Architecture;Network-on-chip;System-on-Chip","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Costs;Data mining;Delay;Indexing;Multiprocessing systems;Network-on-a-chip;Software design","computer architecture;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip","active memory processors;computer architecture;higher memory efficiency;memory access latency;memory-related operations;multiprocessor system-on-chip designs;on-chip network transaction;software designer","","1","","14","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we present a framework to compute theoretical bounds on the performance of DVFS controllers for such systems under the impact of three important technology driven constraints: reliability and temperature driven upper limits on the maximum supply voltage; inductive noise driven constraints on the maximum rate of change of voltage/frequency; and increasing manufacturing process variations. Our experimental results show that, for the benchmarks considered, any DVFS control algorithm will lose up to 87% performance, measured in terms of the number of steps required to reach a reference steady state, in the presence of maximum frequency and maximum frequency increment constraints.

However, the process of diagnosing the cause of these errors, and subsequently fixing them, remains one of the most difficult tasks of verification. The complexity of design descriptions, paired with the scarcity of software tools supporting this task lead to an activity that is mostly ad-hoc, labor intensive and accessible only to a few debugging specialists within a design house. This paper discusses some recent research solutions that support the debugging effort by simplifying and automating bug diagnosis. These novel techniques demonstrate that, through the support of structured methodologies, debugging can become a task pursued by the average design engineer.

However, in analog electronic systems, circuit behaviors are so tightly dependent on their interface conditions that accurate system performance estimations based on characterizations of individual stand-alone circuits is a hard task. Since there is no general solution to this problem, analog system integration has traditionally used ad-hoc solutions heavily dependent on designers' experience. In this paper, we build upon the analog platform-based design methodology by exploiting contracts to enforce correct-by-construction system-level composition. Contracts intuitively capture the thought process of a designer, who aims at guaranteeing circuit performance only under specific assumptions (e.g. loading and dynamic range) on the interface properties. Our approach allows automatic detection and composition of compatible components in a given library. We apply our methodology to an ultra-wide band receiver front-end to show that contracts allow pre-designed IP components to be smoothly integrated and design decisions to be reliably made at a higher abstraction level, both key factors to improve designer productivity.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227075","UWB;analog;assume-guarantee;composition;contract;integration;platform;platform-based design;radio-frequency;system","Analog circuits;Circuit optimization;Contracts;Design methodology;Dynamic range;Libraries;Process design;System performance;System-level design;Time to market","analogue circuits","analog circuit;contract-based system-level composition;correct-by-construction system-level composition","","0","","13","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the first spare-cell-aware analytical placement framework which predicts the spare cell requirement and considers spare cell insertion during global placement. We also propose a multilevel spare cell insertion technique which provides a more efficient spare cell planning and a better control of quality impact due to spare cell insertion.

However, the simulation accuracy relies on the mapping between source code and binary code, which can be destroyed by compiler optimizations. This drawback strongly limits the usability of this technique in practical system design. We introduce an approach to overcome this limitation by converting source code to a low level representation, called intermediate source code (ISC). ISC has accounted for most compiler optimizations and has a structure close to binary code, so it allows for accurate back-annotation of timing information from the binary level. To show the benefits of our approach, we present a quantitative comparison of the related techniques with the proposed one, using a set of benchmarks.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227162","Software timing simulation;iSciSim;system level design","Binary codes;Embedded software;Embedded system;Laser sintering;Optimizing compilers;Software performance;Software systems;System-level design;Timing;Usability","binary codes;program compilers;source coding","binary code;compiler-optimized embedded software;intermediate source code;software simulation;source level simulation;system-level timing simulation","","9","","13","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the SDF model is fairly simple, the analysis algorithms are often of high complexity and the models that need to be analysed may be fairly large. This paper introduces two graph transformations for reducing large SDF graphs into simpler, smaller ones that can be analysed more efficiently and give a conservative and often tight estimation of the timing of the original model and hence of the hard real-time system. We can make SDF based methods more efficient and prove that analyses that were done manually in an ad-hoc fashion in the past, can be done automatically and with guaranteed correctness.

The basic idea is to use floorplanning to guide the placement of objects at the global level. The flow consists of four steps: (1) The objects in the original netlist are clustered into blocks; (2) Floorplanning is performed on the blocks; (3) The blocks are shifted within the chip region to further optimize the wirelength; (4) With big macro locations fixed, incremental placement is applied to place the remaining objects. There are several advantages of handling placement at the global level with a floorplanning technique. First, the problem size can be significantly reduced. Second, exact HPWL can be minimized. Third, precise object distribution can be achieved so that legalization only needs to handle minor overlaps among small objects in a block. Fourth, rotation and various placement constraints on macros can be handled. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new flow, we implement a high-quality floorplan-guided placer called FLOP. We also construct the Modern Mixed-Size (MMS) placement benchmarks which can effectively represent the complexities of modern mixed-size designs and the challenges faced by modern mixed-size placers. Compared with state-of-the-art mixed-size placers and leading macro placers, experimental results show that FLOP achieves the best wirelength, and easily obtains legal solutions on all circuits.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227031","Floorplanning;Incremental Placement;Mixed-size Design","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Large-scale systems;Law;Legal factors;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Routing;Very large scale integration","circuit layout CAD","FLOP;algorithm flow;floorplanning technique;handling placement;high quality floorplan-guided placer;incremental placement;large-scale mixed-size placement;macro placer;modern mixed-size design;modern mixed-size placement;modern mixed-size placer;object distribution","","1","","23","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, recent results report the systematic shift of threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) and increased V<sub>th</sub> variation due to RTA process. The exact amount of variations depends on layout pattern density, RTA heating temperature (T) and effective annealing time. In this work, we develop joint thermal/TCAD simulation and compact modeling tools to analyze performance variability under various layout pattern densities and RTA conditions. With the new simulation capability, we recognize two major variation mechanisms under RTA: the change of effective channel length (L<sub>eff</sub>) induced by lateral dopant diffusion, and the fluctuation of equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) due to incomplete dopant activation. We perform device simulations to quantify transistor performance shift due to L<sub>eff</sub> and EOT variations. Moreover, we propose a suite of compact models that bridge the underlying RTA process with device parameter change for efficient design optimization. The new tools are validated with published silicon data at 45 nm and 65 nm nodes. They will facilitate physical designers to predict and mitigate circuit performance variability due to the layout-dependent RTA process.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227061","Dopant Activation;Layout Pattern;Physical Design;Rapid-Thermal Annealing;Threshold Voltage Variation","Analytical models;Annealing;Fabrication;Fluctuations;Heating;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Semiconductor process modeling;Temperature dependence;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;heating;nanotechnology;optimisation;rapid thermal annealing;technology CAD (electronics)","TCAD simulation;dopant activation;equivalent oxide thickness;layout pattern-dependent rapid-thermal annealing;nanoscale CMOS fabrication;optimization;radiation heating;variability analysis","","0","","10","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internal state of the processor is dominated by the L2 cache. During the process of dumping the cache content, the processor's execution is halted so that the state can be faithfully reproduced offline. In order to reduce the duration for which the processor is halted, and indirectly reduce debug time, we propose two online cache dumping strategies, retransmit non-dumped line (RNL) and dump history table (DHT), with the objective of transferring the cache contents while the processor is executing, and yet maintaining fidelity of the dumped data. For typical experimental debug scenarios, we observe that the effective dump times are reduced to between 0.01% and 3.5% of the original times. We also employ compression to reduce the cache content transfer time and logic analyzer space. Our experiments indicate an average compression ratio of 59.2%.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227124","Cache Compression;Design for Debug;Post-silicon Validation;Processor Debug;Silicon Debug","Circuit testing;Computer science;DH-HEMTs;Debugging;History;Integrated circuit reliability;Integrated circuit testing;Logic design;Logic testing;Permission","cache storage;data compression;logic testing;microprocessor chips","L2 cache;data compression;dump history table;external logic analyzer;offline processing;online cache state dumping;post-silicon processor debugging;processor execution;retransmit nondumped line","","1","","20","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides a desirable simulation framework for system architecture design and exploration. This paper presents a design framework, called SysCOLA, that makes use of the unique advantages of both a new formal modeling language, COLA, and SystemC, and allows for parallel development of application software and system platform. In SysCOLA, function design and architecture exploration are done in the COLA based modeling environment and the SystemC based virtual prototyping environment, respectively. Our concepts of abstract platform and virtual platform abstraction layer facilitate the orthogonalization of functionality and architecture by means of mapping and integration in the respective environments.

Nevertheless, most assertion users stick to writing simple assertions because of the intricacy and effort required to debug complex assertions: one of the major bottlenecks in assertion based verification. We present debugging and diagnosis techniques that automatically identify those parts of an assertion that cause the assertion to fail for a given design and that provide additional automation to efficiently identify the root cause of the failure. These techniques enable major effort savings when working with complex assertions, allowing engineers to use the full capabilities of assertion languages. This enables further productivity and quality improvements in functional verification by lifting mainstream assertion usage to higher abstraction levels such as efficient capture and verification of highlevel design features, operations, and transactions.

With the timing variation of processors' clock speed, it has been observed that considering the effects of resource sharing on the resulting performance yield computation is critically important for accurate design space exploration and evaluation in the system-level design. Unfortunately previous statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) in the system-level has never considered resource sharing in computing the performance yield, or has overly simplified by employing the gate-level SSTAs. In this work, we overcome those limitations by proposing an effective SSTA technique called TSB-SSTA, which schedules and binds tasks to resources in the presence of resource sharing. We also propose a timing variation-aware (TV) framework, called TSB-TV, tightly integrating TSB-SSTA. We have tested the effectiveness of our approach through experimentation with benchmarks, which showed an average of 56.1% improvement in performance yield over conventional methods.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796470","","Clocks;Computer architecture;Multiprocessing systems;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Space exploration;System-level design;TV;Timing","processor scheduling;statistical analysis;system-on-chip","MPSoC architecture;multiprocessor system-on-chip architecture;resource sharing;statistical static timing analysis;system-level design;timing variation-aware task scheduling-binding","","3","","34","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We follow a design process that starts with an application model consisting of C processes communicating via abstract message passing channels. The application model is mapped to a platform net-list of SW and HW cores, buses and buffers. A high speed transaction level model (TLM) is generated to validate abstract communication between processes mapped to different cores. The TLM is further refined into a pin-cycle accurate model (PCAM) for board implementation. The PCAM includes C code for all the HdS layers including routing, packeting, synchronization and bus transfer. The generated HdS methods provide a library of application level services to the C processes on individual SW cores. Therefore, the application developer does not need to write low level HdS for board implementation. Synthesis results for an multi-core MP3 decoder design, using ESE, show that the HdS is generated in order of seconds, compared to hours of manual coding. The quality of synthesized code is comparable to manually written code in terms of performance and code size.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796498","","Application software;Digital audio players;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Libraries;Message passing;Multicore processing;Process design;Routing","embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;software engineering","C code;UC Irvine;abstract communication;embedded system environment;hardware-dependent software synthesis;manycore embedded systems;multicore MP3 decoder design;multicore embedded systems;pin-cycle accurate model;transaction level model","","4","","23","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, decades of work on general-purpose compilation approaches that automatically extracts parallelism from a sequential program has shown limited success. Past work has shown that programming model and algorithm design methods have a great influence on usable parallelism. In this paper, we propose a methodology to explore concurrency via nondeterministic transactional algorithm design, and to program them on multicore processors for CAD applications. We apply the proposed methodology to the min-cost flow problem which has been identified as the key problem in many design optimizations, from wire-length optimization in detailed placement to timing-constrained voltage assignment.

These processors recognize that two critical aspects of machine organization are key to performance: parallel execution and hierarchical memory organization. Conventional processors, which present an illusion of sequential execution and uniform, flat memory, find their performance increasing only slowly over time, and their evolution is at an end. In contrast, throughput processors embrace, rather than deny, parallelism and memory hierarchy to realize large performance and efficiency advantages. Throughput processors have hundreds of cores today and will have thousands of cores by 2015. They will deliver most of the performance, and most of the user value, in future computer systems. This talk will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities in the architecture and programming of future throughput processors, as it relates to the EDA world. First, CAD tools, flows, and methodologies are clearly crucial to the design of these processors, and these must adapt to support such designs. Second, in this changing landscape, CAD tools must need to evolve to run on throughput processors. In throughput processors, performance derives from the parallelism available from the plentiful arithmetic units, and efficiency derives from locality, overcoming restrictions stemming from communication bandwidth bottlenecks that dominate cost, performance, and power. This talk will discuss exploitation of parallelism and locality with examples drawn from the Imagine and Merrimac projects, from NVIDIA GPUs, and from three generations of stream programming systems.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227219","","Arithmetic;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Costs;Design automation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Graphics;Parallel processing;Process design;Throughput","","","","3","","","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-level synthesis has been touted as a solution to these problems, as it can significantly reduce the number of man hours required for a design by raising the level of abstraction. In this paper, we propose a new variation-aware high-level synthesis binding/module selection algorithm, named FastYield, which takes into consideration multiplexers, functional units, registers, and interconnects. Additionally, FastYield connects with the lower levels of the design hierarchy through its inclusion of a timing driven floorplanner guided by a statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) engine which is used to modify/enhance the synthesis solution. FastYield is able to incorporate spatial correlations of process variations in its optimization, which are shown to affect performance yield. On average, FastYield achieves a clock period that is 14.5% smaller, and a performance yield gain of 78.9%, when compared to a variation-unaware algorithm. By making use of accurate timing information, FastYield's rebinding improves performance yield by an average of 9.8% over the initial binding, for the same clock period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-level synthesis binding/module selection algorithm that is layout-driven and variation aware.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796442","","Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Delay;Design optimization;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Multiplexing;Simulated annealing;Timing","circuit optimisation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;statistical analysis;timing","FastYield;layout-driven simultaneous binding;module selection;performance yield optimization;statistical static timing analysis;technology scaling;variation-aware high-level synthesis binding","","6","","20","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, designers repeatedly perform the time-consuming task of re-writing and performing consistency checks for different abstraction level models of the same design. To ease the work, we propose a correct-by-construction method that automatically and simultaneously generates both fast and accurate transaction level bus models for system simulation.

This paper reports on our early efforts to accelerate transistor model evaluations using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We have integrated this accelerator with a commercial fast SPICE tool. Our experiments demonstrate that significant speedups (2.36times on average) can be obtained. The asymptotic speedup that can be obtained is about 4times.

With an anchoring and relocation strategy, we can effectively place I/O buffers at desirable locations. Finally, we further reduce signal skew and monotonic routing density by refining the bumper signal assignment. Experimental results show that signal skew of traditional floorplanners range from 4% to 280% higher than ours. And the total wirelength of other floorplanners is as much as 100% higher than ours.

To eliminate hotspots, physical layouts are always adjusted by shifting or duplicating hot blocks. However, these modifications may degrade the packing area as well as interconnect distribution greatly. In this paper, we propose some novel thermal-aware incremental changes to optimize these multiple objectives including thermal issue in 3D ICs. Furthermore, to avoid random incremental modification, which may be inefficient and need long runtime to converge, here potential gain is modeled for each candidate incremental change. Based on the potential gain, a novel thermal optimization flow to intelligently choose the best incremental operation is presented. We distinguish the thermal-aware incremental changes in three different categories: migrating computation, growing unit and moving hotspot. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are devised according to these different incremental changes. Experimental results show that migrating computation, growing unit and moving hotspot can reduce max on-chip temperature by 7%, 13% and 15% respectively on MCNC/GSRC benchmarks. Still, experimental results also show that the thermal optimization flow can reduce max on-chip temperature by 14% compared to an existing 3D floorplan tool CBA, and achieve better area and total wirelength improvement than individual operations do.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796505","","Computer science;Constraint optimization;Delay;Design optimization;Runtime;Temperature;Thermal conductivity;Thermal degradation;Thermal management;Three-dimensional integrated circuits","integer programming;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;linear programming","3S IC design;incremental floorplanning;interconnect distribution;mixed integer linear programming;onchip temperature;thermal optimization flow;thermal-aware incremental changes;wirelength improvement","","8","1","20","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Random walk is among the most efficient methods for PDN analysis. We develop in this paper an incremental and on-demand random walk to reduce iterative analysis time. During each iteration, we map the design changes as positive or negative random walks for observed nodes. To update PDN analysis result, we only need to apply these extra positive or negative walks, instead of doing all walks from scratch. We show that different execution orders for these walks do not affect accuracy but do affect the runtime because of the cancellation between positive and negative walks. Considering this cancellation effect, we optimize the walk order by solving a min-energy electromagnetic particles placement problem and, as a result, further reduce the runtime to about 8times compared to the worst order. Experiments show that, compared to random walk from scratch, our algorithm has similar accuracy but reduces the iterative analysis time by up to 18times for on-chip PDN sizing, and by up to 13times for package ball assignment with substrate routing. In addition, our incremental random walk has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of observed nodes and is more suitable for on-demand analysis, compared to random walk from scratch and its big warm-up cost.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796478","","Algorithm design and analysis;Design methodology;Helium;Iterative algorithms;Power systems;Runtime;Timing;Uncertainty;Very large scale integration;Voltage","distribution networks;iterative methods;random processes","iterative analysis;min-energy electromagnetic particles placement;on-demand random walk;package ball assignment;power distribution networks;substrate routing","","1","","15","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To explore the space of unexpected timing effects, a set of features are defined to encode paths into path vectors. Each feature is a source of concern that may potentially contribute to the cause of an unexpected timing effect. Finally, a kernel-based clustering algorithm is employed to group similar path vectors into clusters from which the best representative paths are selected for post-silicon monitoring.

The prerouting employs a two-stage technique of congestion-hotspot historical cost pre-increment followed by small bounding-box area routing. The initial routing is based on efficient iterative monotonic routing. For traditional INR, it has evolved as the main stream for the state-of-the-art global routers, which reveals its great ability to reduce the congestion and overflow. As pointed out by recent works, however, traditional INR may get stuck at local optima as the number of iterations increases. To remedy this deficiency, we replace INR by enhanced iterative forbidden-region rip-up/rerouting (IFR) which features three new techniques of (1) multiple forbidden regions expansion, (2) critical subnet rerouting selection, and (3) look-ahead historical cost increment.

Exact synthesis methods can provide optimal solutions in terms of the total number of reversible gates in the synthesis results. Unfortunately, they may suffer from long computation time, due to the fact that the search space is likely to grow exponentially as the circuit size increases. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient synthesis heuristic which provides high quality synthesis results of Toffoli network in more reasonable computation time. We use a weighted, directed graph for reversible function representation and complexity measurement. The proposed algorithm maximally decreases function complexity during synthesis steps. It has the ability to climb out of local minimums and guarantees algorithm convergence. The experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve optimal or very close to optimal solutions with computation time several orders of magnitude less than the exact methods.

Routing congestion between on-board components and the min-max length bounds of the buses must also be considered during routing. In this paper, we present the first automatic bus planner. We tested our system on a state-of-the-art industrial circuit board with over 7000 nets and 12 signal layers. All the nets on this board were already manually routed.

To compute C<sub>p</sub>, we require the violation probabilities of the nodes (i.e., C<sub>n</sub>) and edges (i.e., C<sub>e</sub>) on the path. First, we show computing C<sub>n</sub> and C<sub>e</sub> of all the nodes and edges requires only two rounds of Statistical Static Timing Analysis and then for each node/edge we need one table lookup for probability calculation using a technique known as Pearson Curve. Given C<sub>n</sub> and C<sub>e</sub>, our major contribution is in computing upper and lower bounds for C<sub>p</sub> of an arbitrary path segment. We show constant-time for incremental update of the bounds when extending a path segment to a longer one. These bounds can be used to <i>exactly</i> construct the top violating paths. If the goal is to find the single most-violating path, we show a bound-based formulation that can prune a large portion of circuit without losing optimality. In our simulations, we verify the correctness and accuracy of our bounds for individual paths. We also verify identification of selected paths using Monte Carlo simulation. We obtain near-optimal accuracy with fast runtimes.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796493","","Circuit simulation;Delay;Fluctuations;Integrated circuit interconnections;Measurement;Probability;Process design;Runtime;Table lookup;Timing","Monte Carlo methods;integrated circuit design;statistical analysis;timing","Monte Carlo simulation;bound-based identification;statistical static timing analysis;timing constraint;timing-violating paths","","3","","12","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These early decisions cause two difficulties: how to select the best communication architecture and how to estimate the effect of mapping the application onto the communication resources.

As one of the most powerful techniques for interconnect optimization, buffer insertion is indispensable in the physical synthesis flow. Buffering is known to be NP-complete and existing works either explore dynamic programming to compute optimal solution in the worst-case exponential time or design efficient heuristics without performance guarantee. Even if buffer insertion is one of the most studied problems in physical design, whether there is an efficient algorithm with provably good performance still remains unknown. This work settles this open problem. In the paper, the first fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the timing driven minimum cost buffer insertion problem is designed. The new algorithm can approximate the optimal buffering solution within a factor of 1 + epsiv running in O(m<sup>2</sup>n<sup>2</sup>b/epsiv<sup>3</sup> + n<sup>3</sup>b<sup>2</sup>/epsiv) time for any 0 < epsiv < 1, where n is the number of candidate buffer locations, m is the number of sinks in the tree, and b is the number of buffers in the buffer library. In addition to its theoretical guarantee, our experiments on 1000 industrial nets demonstrate that compared to the commonly-used dynamic programming algorithm, the new algorithm well approximates the optimal solution, with only 0.57% additional buffers and 4.6times speedup. This clearly demonstrates the practical value of the new algorithm.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227028","Buffer Insertion;Cost Minimization;Dynamic Programming;Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme;NP-complete","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Costs;Delay;Dynamic programming;Integrated circuit interconnections;Libraries;Polynomials;Timing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;approximation theory;circuit CAD;computational complexity;integrated circuit design","NP-complete;VLSI technology;buffer insertion;buffer library;circuit timing;fully polynomial time approximation scheme;physical synthesis flow;tree;worst-case exponential time","","0","","18","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional timing verification techniques such as static timing analysis (STA) are usually too conservative or sometimes too optimistic. This inaccuracy may lead to an unnecessary procrastination of time to market or even silicon failure. It is mainly due to the inability to detect false paths and handle multiple-input-transitioning effects in the timing analysis process. In this paper, we proposed a novel formal static timing analysis (FSTA) technique which can model the multiple-input transitioning effects, detect the false paths, and generate an input transition pattern for the true critical path at the same time. This is achieved by tightly integrating a state-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a STA engine, under a specialized multiple-input-transition timing library. Our experiments compare the FSTA engine with the traditional STA and random simulation techniques. The results show that our approach greatly outperforms random simulation while obtaining more accurate timing analysis results than STA.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227206","Critical path selection;false path;formal method;multiple input transitioning;static timing analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit simulation;Delay;Engines;Integrated circuit reliability;Libraries;Performance analysis;Permission;Timing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;computability;performance evaluation;timing circuits","VLSI design flow;false-path aware formal static timing analyzer;formal static timing analysis technique;multiple-input-transitioning effects;silicon failure;simultaneous input transitions;specialized multiple-input-transition timing library;state-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability solver;timing closure","","0","","15","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult or even impossible to predict if a memory access will result in a definite cache hit or miss. This unpredictability is highly undesired especially when designing real-time systems where the worst-case execution time (WCET) is one of the key metrics. Scratchpad memories (SPMs) have proven to be a fully predictable alternative to caches. In contrast to caches, however, SPMs require dedicated compiler support. This paper presents an optimal static SPM allocation algorithm for program code. It minimizes WCETs by placing the most beneficial parts of a program's code in an SPM. Our results underline the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. For a total of 73 realistic benchmarks, we reduced WCETs on average by 7.4% up to 40%.

This paper then develops an elegant recursive algorithm to compute the order statistics (or the metric) in provable linear time and space. With a novel data structure, the order statistics can also be incrementally updated. By employing a branch-and-bound path selection algorithm with above techniques, this paper shows that selecting an optimal set of paths for a multi-million-gate design can be performed efficiently.

Then, we calculate the errors in estimation which result from assuming independence of components generated by linear de-correlation techniques such as PCA and ICA. The experimental result shows that the error predicted by our method is within 1% error compared to the real simulation. In order to deal with non-linear dependence, we further develop a target function driven component analysis algorithm (FCA) to minimize the error caused by ignoring high order dependence and apply such technique to statistical leakage power analysis and SRAM cell noise margin variation analysis.

In this paper, we propose a synthesis approach, that can cope with Boolean functions containing more than a hundred of variables. We present a technique to derive reversible circuits for a function given by a binary decision diagram (BDD). The circuit is obtained using an algorithm with linear worst case behavior regarding run-time and space requirements. Furthermore, the size of the resulting circuit is bounded by the BDD size. This allows to transfer theoretical results known from BDDs to reversible circuits. Experiments show better results (with respect to the circuit cost) and a significantly better scalability in comparison to previous synthesis approaches.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227151","Decision Diagrams;Quantum Logic;Reversible Logic;Synthesis","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;DNA computing;Data structures;Logic design;Optical computing;Optical design;Quantum computing;Runtime","binary decision diagrams;logic circuits","BDD-based synthesis;DNA computing;binary decision diagram;optical computing;quantum computing;reversible logic","","22","","31","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stable explicit numerical integration is achieved by adopting an explicit inner integrator (e.g. forward Euler) in a multi-level telescopic projective framework, thereby addressing the well-known stability limitation of many explicit numerical integration methods. In the presented approach, the effective time step of the entire multi-level integration is no longer limited by the smallest time constant of the circuit so as to safeguard stability. Rather, it is controlled solely by the accuracy requirement. This makes it possible to explore the natural parallelizability of such explicit integration method for parallel circuit simulation.

Our work explores the fundamental relations between the SER of sequential circuits and their testability in scan mode, and appears to be the first to improve both through retiming. Our retiming methodology relocates registers so that [1] registers become less observable with respect to primary outputs, thereby decreasing overall SER, and [2] combinational nodes become more observable with respect to registers (but not with respect to primary outputs), thereby increasing scan testability. We present experimental results which show an average decrease of 42% in the SER of latches, and an average improvement of 31% random pattern testability.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227049","Retiming;Soft Errors;Testability","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit testing;Logic design;Logic testing;Manufacturing;Registers;Resilience;Sequential analysis;Sequential circuits;Timing","circuit reliability;circuit testing;combinational circuits;hardware-software codesign;network synthesis;optimising compilers;sequential circuits","registers;retiming;sequential circuits;soft errors;state elements;testability improvement","","0","","21","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the high performance nature of these designs, critical paths predicted by the timing tools often do not match the actual speedpaths found on silicon chips. Early silicon data therefore is used to identify the speedpaths, and further performance optimization is carried out by pushing the delays on these paths. In this context, the paper presents a novel data mining approach that analyzes a small number of identified speedpaths against a large number of non-speedpaths. The result of this analysis for each speedpath is a set of hypotheses explaining why the path is special. These hypotheses can be used in guiding the search for the root causes, or in predicting additional paths as potential speedpaths. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and summarize our findings based on analysis of silicon speedpaths collected from a 65nm microprocessor.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227127","Data Mining;Speedpath;Timing Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Data mining;Delay;Microprocessors;Optimization;Performance analysis;Process design;Silicon;Timing","data mining;microprocessor chips","data mining;hypothesis pruning;silicon chips;silicon speedpaths;speed limiting paths;speedpath analysis;timing tools","","1","","12","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Post layout decomposition algorithm may not be enough to achieve high quality solution for DPL-unfriendly designs, due to complex 2D patterns in lower metal layers. Therefore, DPL-friendliness is needed at routing stage. Another key yield improvement technique is redundant via insertion. However, this would increase the complexity in DPL-compliance. To make designs manufacturable in DPL, we should not insert a redundant via if it results in coloring conflict. This paper is the first work to consider DPL and redundant via together. We have developed two algorithms, post-routing DPL-aware insertion and DPL-friendly routing with redundant via consideration to take into account redundant via DPL-compliance. Experimental results show that, compared to a DPL-aware optimization flow without redundant via consideration, we can improve insertion rate by 43% while still achieving zero coloring conflicts.

Therefore, we address the problem of efficiently computing a set of linear systems through a tool, Xquasher, that is developed by us to enable elimination of large common subexpression from expressions with an arbitrary number of terms.

As a result, the negative impact of process variations on the maximum operating frequency and the total power consumption of a processor is expected to worsen. Meanwhile, manufacturers have integrated more cores in a single die, substantially improving the throughput of a processor running highly-parallel applications. However, many existing applications do not have high enough parallelism to exploit multiple cores in a die. In this paper, first, we analyze the throughput impact of applying per-core power gating and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to power- and thermal-constrained multicore processors. To optimize the throughput of the multicore processors running applications with limited parallelism, we exploit power- and thermal-headroom resulted from power-gated idle cores, allowing active cores to increase operating frequency through supply voltage scaling. Our analysis using a 32 nm predictive technology model shows that optimizing the number of active cores and operating frequency within power, thermal, and supply voltage scaling limits improves the throughput of a 16-core processor by ~16%. Furthermore, we extend our throughput analysis and optimization to consider the impact of within-die process variations leading to core-to-core frequency (and leakage power) variations in a multicore processor. Our analysis shows that exploiting core-to-core frequency variations improves the throughput of a 16-core processor by ~75%.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227202","DVFS;multicore processor;power gating","Analytical models;Delay;Dynamic voltage scaling;Frequency;Manufacturing processes;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Permission;Process design;Throughput","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","DVFS;dynamic frequency scaling;dynamic voltage scaling;leakage power;maximum operating frequency;nonuniform transistor delay;parallel application;per-core power-gating;power consumption;process variability;thermal-constrained multicore processor","","4","","10","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At characterization time logic gates are simulated at the circuit level with a range of input waveforms (e.g., saturated ramps with different slews) and various output loads. At timing analysis time the same gates are driven by input waveforms that differ from the class of characterization waveforms. This paper proposes a method for mapping the waveforms that arise in static timing analysis to members of the class of waveforms used to characterize gate timing performance during library characterization. The method is based on the moments of the input waveform, which describe concisely the salient features of the waveform. The mapping between the input waveform and the effective characterization waveform is accomplished by positing functional relationships between the input waveform's moments and the parameters of the characterization waveform. The unknown coefficients of this functional relationship are determined by minimizing the worst case error of the output waveform over a representative set of input waveforms and gate loads. The technique requires no change to the library characterization procedure, and minimal change to the static timing tool with little to no additional computational burden on the timer.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227209","Current Source Model;Timing Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Libraries;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Permission;Signal analysis;Timing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;logic gates","VLSI circuits;gate timing performance;library characterization;logic gates;moment-based effective characterization waveform;static timing analysis","","0","3","15","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications may run concurrently and can be started and stopped over time. Each application may typically have multiple feasible configurations, trading off quality aspects (energy consumption, audio-visual quality) with resource usage for various types of resources. Overall system quality needs to be guaranteed and optimized at all times. This leads to the need for a run-time management solution that selects an appropriate system configuration from all the application configurations of active applications. This run-time management problem can be phrased as a multi-dimensional multiple-choice knapsack (MMKP) problem. We present a compositional heuristic to solve MMKP, that due to the compositionality is better suited to CMP run-time management than existing heuristics that are all not compositional. Our heuristic outperforms the best-known heuristic to date. The heuristic is parameterized, leading to the additional advantage that it allows to trade off execution time vs. solution quality, and to bound the time needed to compute a solution. The latter makes it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained embedded platforms.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227146","CMP run-time management;MMKP;Pareto algebra","Algebra;Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Delay;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Permission;Runtime;Technology management","Pareto optimisation;algebra;knapsack problems;microprocessor chips","CMP run-time management;Pareto algebra;audio-visual quality;chip multiprocessors;embedded systems;energy consumption;off-line Pareto analysis;parameterized compositional multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack heuristic;resource-constrained embedded platforms","","0","","12","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, compilers apply ad-hoc heuristics during optimization to improve code quality. One of the most important optimizations is register allocation. Many compilers heuristically decide when and where to spill a register to memory, without having a clear understanding of the impact of such spill code on a program's run time. This paper extends a graph coloring register allocator such that it uses precise worst-case execution time (WCET) models. Using this WCET timing data, the compiler tries to avoid spill code generation along the critical path defining a program's WCET. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to present a WCET-aware register allocator. Our results underline the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

For efficient Markov-chain analysis, the paper describes three methods that can limit the number of states: a state discretization scheme based on Gaussian decomposition, a state exploration algorithm that discovers the recurrent states, and a state truncation algorithm that eliminates the states with negligible stationary probabilities. The stochastic AC analysis is performed by deriving a first-order ordinary differential equation governing the perturbations in the stationary probabilities and solving it via phasor analysis. In the digital PLL and first-order DeltaSigma ADC examples, the number of states was reduced by a factor of 35 and the frequency-domain phase and noise transfer functions were simulated with a 57~22,000times speed-up compared to using transient, Monte-Carlo simulations.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227117","Markov chains;adjoint sensitivity analysis;steady-state analysis;stochastic systems","Algorithm design and analysis;Differential equations;Frequency domain analysis;Performance analysis;Phase locked loops;Probability distribution;Sensitivity analysis;Steady-state;Stochastic resonance;Stochastic systems","Markov processes;differential equations;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;probability;stochastic processes","Gaussian decomposition;Markov chain model;adjoint sensitivity analysis;first-order ordinary differential equation;mixed-signal system;phasor analysis;probability distribution;state discretization scheme;state exploration algorithm;state truncation algorithm;stochastic AC analysis;stochastic steady-state analysis","","1","","19","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the processors of such systems, the instruction cache consumes a significant fraction of the total energy. One of the most popular methods to reduce the energy consumption is to shut down idle cache banks. However, we observe that operating idle cache banks at a reduced voltage/frequency level along with the active banks in a pipelined manner can potentially achieve even better energy savings. In this paper, we propose a novel DVS-based pipelined reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy called PRIM. A canonical example of our proposed PRIM consists of four cache banks. Two of these cache banks can be configured at runtime to operate at lower voltage and frequency levels than that of the normal cache. Instruction fetch throughput is maintained by pipelining the accesses to the low voltage banks. We developed a profile-driven compilation framework that analyzes applications and inserts the appropriate cache reconfiguration points. Our experimental results show that PRIM can significant reduce the energy consumption for popular embedded benchmarks with minimal performance overhead. We obtained 56.6% and 45.1% energy savings for aggressive and conservative VDD settings, respectively, at the expense of a 1.66% performance overhead.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227134","Instruction cache;low power;reconfigurable memory","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer aided instruction;Dynamic voltage scaling;Embedded computing;Energy consumption;Frequency;Permission;Pipeline processing;Throughput;Voltage control","cache storage;pipeline processing;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","battery operated embedded systems;cache reconfiguration points;energy consumption;energy savings;idle cache banks;instruction cache;pipelined reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy;profile-driven compilation framework;voltage banks","","2","","18","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, SystemC has become a well-established simulation tool for transaction level modeling (TLM) in the integrated electronics industry but it lacks the support for power modeling. This paper introduces ActivaSC, a flexible, fast, transparent and non-intrusive extension to the SystemC class library which allows capturing the activity information of a digital system being modeled. This information can then be post-processed to estimate power consumption. ActivaSC avoids time consuming design iterations as designers can assess architectural design trade-offs based on system activity early in the design flow. ActivaSC does not require any code alterations nor a specific API, so that it can be used with any modeling style. Finally, several benchmark tests illustrate the superior efficiency of ActivaSC.

Asia and South Pacific","20090227","2009","","","79","84","As technology scales, the delay uncertainty caused by process variations has become increasingly pronounced in deep submicron designs. In the presence of process variations, worst-case timing analysis may lead to overly conservative synthesis, and may end up using excess resources to guarantee design constraints. In this paper, we propose an efficient variation-aware resource sharing and binding algorithm in behavioral synthesis, which takes into account the performance variations for functional units. The performance yield, which is defined as the probability that the synthesized hardware meets the target performance constraints, is used to evaluate the synthesis result. An efficient metric called statistical performance improvement, is used to guide resource sharing and binding. The proposed algorithm is evaluated within a commercial synthesis framework that generates optimized RTL netlists from behavioral specifications. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated with a set of industrial benchmark designs, which consist of blocks that are commonly used in wireless and image processing applications. The experimental results show that our method achieves an average 33% area reduction over traditional methods, which are based on the worst-case delay analysis, with an average 10% run time overhead.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796445","","Delay;Graphics;Hardware;High level synthesis;Partitioning algorithms;Performance analysis;Resource management;Timing;Transistors;Uncertainty","circuit CAD;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","behavioral synthesis;delay uncertainty;hand coded register-transfer level;statistical performance improvement;submicron designs;variation-aware resource binding;variation-aware resource sharing","","3","","26","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, faults inside scan cells are not directly targeted by scan based tests currently used, and they are assumed to be detected by what are called flush tests. Recently we investigated the detectability of stuck-at, stuck-on and stuck-open faults internal to scan chains using existing tests. We also proposed new flush tests and appropriate ordering of flush tests to achieve higher fault coverage. In this paper, we investigate detection of a set of scan cell internal bridging faults extracted from layout. We show that the detection of some zero-resistance non-feedback bridging faults requires two-pattern tests. Half-speed flush tests we proposed earlier to improve the coverage of stuck-at, stuck-on and stuck-open faults also detect additional bridging faults. We classify the undetectable faults based on the reasons for their undetectability. We observe that the driver strengths of the scan cell inputs can be optimized to improve the bridging fault coverage. Both zero-resistance and nonzero-resistance bridging fault models are considered in this work. A low power supply voltage based test method and IDDQ testing are examined for resistive bridging fault detection.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796558","","Automatic test pattern generation;Bridge circuits;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Cities and towns;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Low voltage;Power supplies;Sequential analysis","VLSI;automatic test pattern generation;circuit layout;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing","VLSI design;flush tests;internal bridging faults;scan chains;stuck-at faults;stuck-on faults;stuck-open faults","","1","","35","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a technique that alters clock network lines so that the circuit meets its timing constraints at all process corners. This is done near the end of the design flow while considering delay variability in both the clock network and the functional blocks. Our method operates at the physical level and provides designers with the required changes in clock network line widths and/or lengths.

An efficient dynamic frequency-to-voltage scaling (DF2VS) algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust supply voltage according to the oscillation frequencies of the ring oscillators distributed in SoC so that thermal sensing can be carried at all potential hot spots. An on-chip Dynamic Voltage Scaling or Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVS or DVFS) monitor selects the supply voltage level and clock frequency according to the outputs of all thermal sensors. Experimental results on SoC benchmark circuits show the effectiveness of the algorithm that a 10% reduction in supply voltage alone can achieve about 20% power reduction (DVS scheme), and nearly 50% reduction in power is achievable if the clock frequency is also scaled down (DVFS scheme).

Current trends use diagnosis as the first step in extracting valuable information from a large population of failing ICs that include, for example, design-feature failure rates and defect-occurrence statistics. However, it is difficult to examine the accuracy of these techniques because of the unavailability of sufficient fail data where such information is known. This paper describes an approach for benchmarking and verifying diagnosis techniques through failure population creation that builds on prior work in this area. Specifically, we describe how a population of realistic IC failures is created through circuit-level simulation of extracted layouts. The most novel feature of the work is that the virtual test responses produced are both a precise function of defect type and the three-dimensional location within the layout. The extended approach is demonstrated using twelve placed-and-routed circuits. An example application of the developed framework is given to illustrate the utility of having a failure population where the location and type of defect are known a priori.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227107","Failure Analysis;Fault Diagnosis;Verification","Automatic testing;Circuit testing;Data mining;Failure analysis;Fault diagnosis;Foundries;Integrated circuit reliability;Integrated circuit testing;Pattern analysis;Statistics","benchmark testing;circuit simulation;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;statistical analysis","automated failure population creation;benchmarking approach;circuit-level simulation;defect-occurrence statistics;design-feature failure rates;integrated circuit diagnosis methods;realistic IC failures","","1","1","33","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the ""measurement to disclosure"" (MTD) used, we define a lower level metric, power-attack tolerance (PAT), to model both dynamic power and leakage power data-dependence. We show that the PAT of a typical cryptographic component implementation using CMOS standard-cells can significantly deteriorate due to process variations, thus increasing the component's vulnerability to power attacks. Power-attack-resistant logic styles (e.g. SABL) have been developed which increase PAT by an order of magnitude by balancing power consumption at the gate level with considerable overhead. However in the presence of process variations, the degradation probability of MTD is 57%.

Although several approaches have been proposed to obtain the worst-case aggressor alignment, most of them compute only the worst-case stage delay of the victim. However, in reality it is essential to compute the worst-case combined delay of victim stage and victim receiver gate. We propose a heuristic approach to compute the worst-case aggressor alignment which maximizes the victim receiver output arrival time.

Behavioral simulation, though useful for functional analysis at high level, does not provide any performance information that is crucial for design and analysis of MPSoC implementations. As a consequence, designers are often reduced to manually annotate performance information onto behavioral models, which contributes further to inefficiency and inaccuracy. In this paper, we use structural performance models to provide fast and accurate simulation of software for MPSoC.We generate structural models automatically using GCC with accurate performance annotation while considering optimizations for instruction selection, branch prediction, and pipeline interlock. Our structural models are able to simulate at several orders of magnitude faster than ISS and provide less than 1% error on performance estimation. These models allow realistic MPSoC design space explorations based on performance characteristics with simulation speed comparable to behavioral simulation.

To design radiation tolerant circuits efficiently, techniques are required to analyze the effects of a radiation particle strike on a circuit early in the design flow, and hence evaluate the circuit's resilience to SEU events. For an accurate estimation of the SEU tolerance of a circuit, it is important to consider the effects of electrical masking. This is typically done by performing circuit simulations, which are slow. In this paper, we present an analytical model for the determination of the shape of radiation-induced voltage glitches in combinational circuits. The output of our approach can be propagated to the primary outputs of the circuit using existing tools, thereby modeling the effects of electrical masking. This enables an accurate and quick evaluation of the SEU robustness of a circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is very accurate, with a very low root mean square percentage error in the estimation of the shape of the voltage glitch of (4.5%) compared to SPICE. Our model gains its accuracy by using a non-linear model for the load current of the gate, and by considering the effect of tau<sub>beta</sub> on the radiation induced voltage glitch. Our analytical model is very fast (275 times faster than SPICE) and accurate, and can therefore be easily incorporated in a design flow to estimate the SEU tolerance of circuits early in the design process.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796523","","Analytical models;Frequency;Pulse shaping methods;Resilience;SPICE;Sequential circuits;Shape;Single event transient;Single event upset;Voltage","combinational circuits;sequential circuits","SEU-induced pulse shape;SPICE;combinatorial circuits;electrical masking;nonlinear model;radiation induced voltage;radiation particle strike;radiation tolerant circuits;radiation-induced voltage;sequential circuits;single event upsets","","3","","28","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though high-performance chips' working frequencies are much higher than this resonance frequency in general, chip runtime loading frequency is not. When a chip executes a chunk of instructions repeatedly, the induced current load may have harmonic components close to this resonance frequency, causing excessive power integrity degradation. Existing PDN design solutions are, however, mainly targeted at reducing high-frequency noise and not effective to suppress such resonance noise. In this work, we propose a novel approach to proactively suppress this type of noise. A method based on a high dimension generalized Markov process is developed to predict current load variation. Based on such prediction, a clock frequency actuator design is proposed to proactively select an optimal clock frequency to suppress the resonance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on proactively reducing runtime instruction execution induced PDN resonance noise.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796509","","Actuators;Clocks;Degradation;Load management;Markov processes;Noise reduction;Power system harmonics;Resonant frequency;Runtime;Stochastic resonance","Markov processes;RLC circuits;circuit resonance;network synthesis","Markov process;distributed RLC network;power delivery network;resonance frequency;runtime resonance noise reduction;stochastic current prediction enabled frequency actuator","","3","","17","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a functional unit, its maximum allowable delay (for a target clock period) limits the smallest standby leakage current its power gating can achieve. In this paper, we point out: in the high-level synthesis of a non-zero clock skew circuit, the resource binding (including functional units and registers) has a large impact on the maximum allowable delays of functional units; as a result, different resource binding solutions have different standby leakage currents. Based on that observation, we present the first work to draw up the timing driven power gating in high-level synthesis. Given a target clock period and design constraints, our goal is to derive the minimum-standby-leakage-current resource binding solution.

Asia and South Pacific","20090227","2009","","","260","265","In this paper, we explore the implementation of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) on a graphics processing unit (GPU). SSTA via Monte Carlo simulations is a computationally expensive, but important step required to achieve design timing closure. It provides an accurate estimate of delay variations and their impact on design yield. The large number of threads that can be computed in parallel on a GPU suggests a natural fit for the problem of Monte Carlo based SSTA to the GPU platform. Our implementation performs multiple delay simulations at a single gate in parallel. A parallel implementation of the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator on the GPU, followed by box-Muller transformations (also implemented on the GPU) is used for generating gate delay numbers from a normal distribution. The mu and sigma of the pin-to-output delay distributions for all inputs and for every gate, are obtained using a memory lookup, which benefits from the large memory bandwidth of the GPU. Threads which execute in parallel have no data/control dependencies on each other. All threads compute identical instructions, but on different data, as required by the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) programming semantics of the GPU. Our approach is implemented on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8800 GPU card. Our results indicate that our approach can obtain an average speedup of about 260times as compared to a serial CPU implementation. With the recently announced quad 8800 GPU cards, we estimate that our approach would attain a speedup of over 785times. The correctness of the Monte Carlo based SSTA implemented on a GPU has been verified by comparing its results with a CPU based implementation.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796490","","Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Delay;Delay estimation;Gaussian distribution;Graphics processing unit;Monte Carlo methods;Timing;Yield estimation","Monte Carlo methods;computer graphics;parallel processing","Monte Carlo simulations;NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8800 GPU card;SIMD programming semantics;box-Muller transformations;delay variations;graphics processing units;memory lookup;multiple delay simulations;pin-to-output delay distributions;single instruction multiple data;statistical static timing analysis","","17","2","30","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate such variability-induced storage density penalty, this paper presents a smaller-than-worst-case transistor sizing approach with the underlying theme of jointly considering memory cell transistor sizing and defect tolerance. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using 256 Mb STT MRAM design at 45 nm node as a test vehicle.

The proposed system is able to perform an on-line minimization of chip thermal gradients based on both scheduler requirements and the chip thermal profile.

Test power is also a challenge for delay testing, so our method tries to reduce the test power at the same time. By the analysis of the functional dependency between test vectors in broadside testing and the shift dependency between vectors in the skewed-load testing, some scan cells are selected to operate in the enhanced scan and skewed-load scan mode, while others operate in traditional broadside mode. In the architecture, scan cells with common successors are divided into one chain. With the efficient conflict driven selection methods and partition of scan cells, fault coverage can be improved greatly and test power can be reduced, without sacrificing the test time and test data. Experimental results show that the fault coverage of the proposed method can reach the level of enhanced scan design.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796556","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Delay;Educational technology;Fault detection;Laboratories;Multiplexing;Software testing;Switches","circuit testing;fault diagnosis","conflict driven scan chain configuration;delay testing;high transition fault coverage;low test power;skewed-load testing;transition fault","","1","","24","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DPL decomposes and prints the shapes of a critical-layer layout in two exposures. In traditional single-exposure lithography, adjacent identical layout features will have identical mean critical dimension (CD), and spatially correlated CD variations. However, with DPL, adjacent features can have distinct mean CDs, and uncorrelated CD variations. This introduces a new set of dasiabimodalpsila challenges for timing analysis and optimization. We assess the potential impact of DPL on timing analysis error and guard banding, and find that the traditional dasiaunimodalpsila characterization and analysis framework may not be viable for DPL. For example, using 45 nm models, we find that different DPL mask layout solutions can cause 50 ps skew in clock distribution that is unseen by traditional analyses. Different mask layouts can also result in 20% or more change in timing path delays. Such results lead to insights into physical design optimizations for clock and data path placement and mask coloring that can help mitigate the error and guardband costs of DPL.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796527","","Clocks;Delay;Error analysis;Lithography;Logic;Page description languages;Pattern analysis;Production;Shape;Timing","masks;nanolithography;nanopatterning;optimisation","DPL;bimodal CD distribution;critical dimension;data path placement;double patterning lithography;mask coloring;memory products;optimization;timing analysis","","10","4","13","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a floorplanner for 3D chips is proposed that organizes functional blocks according to critical microarchitectural communication paths. The floorplanner identifies the potential triggers, in the form of feedback delays, which are responsible for the largest communication costs and places the contributing functional blocks in such a way that those costs are minimized.

Therefore, the power supply noise problem, already a major issue in 2D, is even more severe in 3D. CMOS decoupling capacitors (decaps) have been used effectively for controlling power grid noise in the past, but with technology scaling, they have grown increasingly leaky. As an alternative, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) decaps, with high capacitance densities and low leakage current densities, have been proposed. In this paper, we explore the tradeoffs between using MIM decaps and traditional CMOS decaps, and propose a congestion-aware 3D power supply network optimization algorithm to optimize this tradeoff. The algorithm applies a sequence-of-linear-programs based method to find the optimum tradeoff between MIM and CMOS decaps. Experimental results show that power grid noise can be more effectively optimized after the introduction of MIM decaps, with lower leakage power and little increase in the routing congestion, as compared to a solution using CMOS decaps only.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796477","","CMOS technology;Capacitance;Circuit noise;Current supplies;Leakage current;MIM capacitors;Metal-insulator structures;Packaging;Power grids;Power supplies","CMOS integrated circuits;MIM devices;capacitors;power supplies to apparatus","3D circuits;CMOS decoupling capacitors;MIM decoupling capacitors;congestion-aware power grid optimization;metal-insulator-metal;power supply network optimization algorithm;power supply noise;sequence-of-linear-programs","","11","","28","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optimization flow for designing this scheme based on eye-diagram prediction and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is devised. This flow is used to study the latency, power dissipation and throughput performance of the new global wiring scheme as the technology scales from 90 nm to 22 nm. Comparing to repeated RC wire, experimental results demonstrate that at 22 nm technology node, the new scheme can reduce the normalized delay by 80%-95%, the normalized energy consumption by 50%-94%. The normalized latency is 10 ps/mm, the energy per bit is 20 pJ/m, and the throughput is 15 Gbps/mum.

We propose a Built-In Delay Measurement (BIDM) circuit that is modified from Vernier Delay Lines. All digitally designed BIDMs with small area overhead can be easily embedded within testing circuits. BIDMs can be used to record the data propagation delay times within circuit path segments, for delay testing, diagnosis, and calibration requirements internal to the chip. Our BIDM was implemented in a 32 bit error correction circuit by a chip using TSMC 0.18u technology. The instruments measured results showing that the BIDM chip correctly reported the CUT segment path delay times.

DAC '09. 46th ACM/IEEE","20090828","2009","","","484","489","Exponentially rising cooling/packaging costs due to high power density call for architectural and software level thermal management. Dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques continuously monitor the on-chip processor temperature. Appropriate mechanisms (e.g., dynamic voltage or frequency scaling (DVFS), clock gating, fetch gating, etc.) are engaged to lower the temperature if it exceeds a threshold. However, all these mechanisms incur significant performance penalty. We argue that runtime adaptation of microarchitectural parameters, such as instruction window size and issue width, is a more effective mechanism for DTM. If the architectural parameters can be tailored to track the available instruction level parallelism of the program, the temperature is reduced with minimal performance degradation. Moreover, synergistically combining architectural adaptation with DVFS and fetch gating can achieve the best performance under thermal constraints. The key difficulty in using multiple mechanisms is to select the optimal configuration at runtime for time varying workloads. We present a novel software level thermal management framework that searches through the configuration space at regular intervals to find the best performing design point that is thermally safe. The central components of our framework are (1) a neural network based classifier that filters the thermally unsafe configurations, (2) a fast performance prediction model for any configuration, and (3) an efficient configuration space search algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our adaptive scheme achieves 59% reduction in performance overhead compared to DVFS and 39% reduction in overhead compared to DVFS combined with fetch gating.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227043","Architecture Adaptation;Dynamic Thermal Management","Cooling;Costs;Energy management;Monitoring;Packaging;Runtime;Software packages;Temperature;Thermal management;Threshold voltage","neural nets;power aware computing;thermal management (packaging)","architectural adaptation;architectural parameter;clock gating;dynamic thermal management;fetch gating;frequency scaling;instruction level parallelism;microarchitectural parameter;minimal performance degradation;neural network based classifier;on-chip processor temperature;packaging;performance penalty;performance prediction model;power density;software level thermal management;space search algorithm;thermal constraint","","1","","18","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The arbiter, called ldquoBTPCrdquo, features single-cycle arbitration and routing-control by means of the novel binary-tree paths convergence and path-prediction mechanisms, to provide a highly reduced time complexity.

Excessive runtime thermal variations compromise the performance and reliability of integrated circuits. To address these thermal issues, state of the art chips have integrated thermal sensors that monitor temperatures at a few selected die locations. These temperature measurements are then used by thermal management techniques to appropriately manage chip performance. Thermal sensors and their support circuitry incur design overheads, die area, and manufacturing costs. In this paper, we propose a new direction for full thermal characterization of integrated circuits based on spectral Fourier analysis techniques. Application of these techniques to temperature sensing is based on the observation that die temperature is simply a space varying signal, and that space varying signals are treated identically to time varying signals in signal analysis. We utilize Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory to devise methods that can almost fully reconstruct the thermal status of an integrated circuit during runtime using a minimal number of thermal sensors. We propose methods that can handle uniform and non uniform thermal sensor placements. We develop an extensive experimental setup and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by thermally characterizing a 16-core processor. Our method produces full thermal characterization with an average absolute error of 0.6% using a limited number of sensors.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227042","Thermal management;spatial estimation;spectral methods;thermal sensors","Costs;Integrated circuit reliability;Manufacturing;Monitoring;Scalability;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Thermal management;Thermal sensors","Fourier analysis;information theory;integrated circuit modelling;microprocessor chips;signal reconstruction;temperature sensors;thermal management (packaging)","16-core processor thermal characterization;Fourier analysis technique;Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory;integrated thermal sensor;thermal management techniques;thermal signal reconstruction","","3","1","19","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As feature sizes near the atomic scale, extensive variation and wearout inevitably make margining uneconomical or impossible. The ElastIC project seeks to address this by creating a large-scale chip-multiprocessor that can self-diagnose, adapt, and heal. Creating large, flexible designs in this environment naturally lends itself to the repetitive nature of network-on-chip (NoC), but the loss of a single link or router will result in complete network failure. In this work we present Vicis, an ElastIC-style NoC that can tolerate the loss of many network components due to wearout induced hard faults. Vicis uses the inherent redundancy in the network and its routers in order to maintain correct operation while incurring a much lower area overhead than previously proposed N-modular redundancy (NMR) based solutions. Each router has a built-in-self-test (BIST) that diagnoses the locations of hard fault and runs a number of algorithms to best use ECC, port swapping, and a crossbar bypass bus to mitigate them. The routers work together to run distributed algorithms to solve network-wide problems as well, protecting the networking against critical failures in individual routers. In this work we show that with stuck-at fault rates as high as 1 in 2000 gates, Vicis will continue to operate with approximately half of its routers still functional and communicating.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227053","Built-in-Self-Test;Fault Tolerance;Hard Faults;N-Modular Redundancy;Network-on-Chip;Reconfiguration;Torus","Electric breakdown;Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerance;Network-on-a-chip;Power system management;Redundancy;Silicon;System recovery;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","built-in self test;distributed algorithms;failure analysis;microprocessor chips;network-on-chip;redundancy","ECC;ElastIC project;N-modular redundancy;Vicis;built-in-self-test;crossbar bypass bus;distributed algorithms;hard fault;large-scale chip-multiprocessor;network failure;network redundancy;network-on-chip;port swapping;process scaling;routers;stuck-at fault rates","","19","","24","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach relaxes the discrete layer assignments so that they are continuous in the z-direction and the problem can be solved by an analytical global placer. A key idea is to do the overlap removal and device layer assignment simultaneously by adding a density penalty function for both area & TS via density constraints. Experimental results show that this analytical placer in a multilevel framework is effective to achieve trade-offs between wirelength and TS via number. Compared to the recently published transformation-based 3D placement method, we are able to achieve on average 12% shorter wirelength and 29% fewer TS via compared to their cases with best wirelength; we are also able to achieve on average 20% shorter wirelength and 50% fewer TS via number compared to their cases with best TS via numbers.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796507","","Computer science;Delay systems;Electronic mail;Engines;Integrated circuit interconnections;Power system interconnection;Radio frequency;Temperature;Thermal force;Three-dimensional integrated circuits","integrated circuits;nonlinear programming","3D IC;3D placement method;area density constraint;density penalty function;device layer assignment;discrete layer assignment;multilevel analytical placement;multilevel nonlinear programming;three-dimensional IC technologies","","20","","17","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a prototyping platform (FPGA-based) and a methodology for these applications. Our platform consists of a mix of standard and custom heterogeneous cores. We discuss several case studies, analyzing the interaction of the architecture and applications and we show that multimedia and telecommunication applications with unbalanced pipeline stages can be easily deployed.

Memory organizations, which account for a large part of the system energy and the time budgets, are especially vulnerable to process variation. Configurable - multimode - memories are a promising technology to deal with these problems, but they also introduce new issues that need to be solved. Essentially, adding configuration capabilities to the memories comes with a cost, both in memory area and control complexity; hence, we need to evaluate what is the minimum amount of re-configurability to satisfy system's constraints.

The requirement of extensive memory bandwidth puts a major performance bottleneck in multi-core architectures for media applications. While the parallel memory system is a viable solution to account for a large amount of memory transactions required by multiple cores, memory access conflicts caused by simultaneous accesses to an identical memory page by two or more cores limit the performance of multi-core architectures. We propose and evaluate the programmable memory address shuffler associated with the novel memory shuffling algorithm integrated in multi-core architectures with parallel memory system. The address shuffler efficiently translates the requested memory addresses into the shuffled addresses such that access conflicts diminish by analyzing the access pattern of the application. We demonstrate that the shuffling of sub-pages is represented by cyclic linked list which enables partial address shuffling with the minimal number of shuffling table entries.

This paper presents a fast clock-skew analysis via parameterized incremental truncated-balanced-realization, called piTBR method. Environmental uncertainties are parametrically and structurally added into the state equation of clock network. A compact macromodel is obtained by the subspace projection constructed from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of circuit output waveforms. To reduce the computational cost, we propose an incremental SVD method that only needs to partially update the projection matrix by analyzing the perturbed output waveform owning to environmental uncertainties. Experiments on a number of clock networks show that compared with the macromodeling by the fast TBR method, our method reduces the computational cost in the order of 100times with a similar accuracy. In addition, compared with the macromodeling by the Krylov-subspace-based method, our method reduces the waveform error by 2times with a similar runtime.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796510","","Circuits;Clocks;Computational efficiency;Equations;Large-scale systems;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition;Temperature;Uncertainty;Voltage fluctuations","clocks;integrated circuit modelling;singular value decomposition","circuit output waveforms;clock-skew;environmental uncertainty;incremental macromodeling;nontree-clock network;parameterized macromodeling;singular value decomposition;supply voltage fluctuation;thermal temperature gradient","","0","","22","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Soft lists, a new index structure for embedded devices with NOR flash, are proposed. The challenge of data indexing over NOR flash is that data update and pointer update may recursively trigger each other. Our approach is to allow a bounded number of probes when a pointer is de-referenced. By this way update and garbage collection is largely simplified, because data can be moved around physical locations without invalidating any pointers. Even better, search with soft lists is very fast, because the probes provide opportunities of forward random skips.

The reasons include lack of a self-assembly technology which could form complex carbon nanotube structures, or, absence of a reconfigurable carbon nanotube device which could provide functionality, reliability, and performance via reconfigurability. In this paper, I propose a novel double gate carbon nanotube field effect transistor (RDG-CNFET), which is reconfigurable to be open, short, FET, or via. Layers of orthogonal carbon nanotubes with electrically bistable molecules sandwiched at each crossing form a dense array of RDG-CNFETs and programmable interconnects, and constitute a nanoelectronic architecture of manufacturability (via regularity), reliability (via reconfigurability), and performance (via device density). Simulation based on CNFET and molecular device compact models demonstrates superior logic density, reliability, performance and power consumption of the proposed RDGCNFET based nanoelectronic circuits compared with the existing, e.g., molecular diode/MOSFET based nanoelectronic circuits.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796587","","CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;Circuit simulation;Double-gate FETs;Integrated circuit interconnections;Manufacturing;Nanoscale devices;Programmable logic arrays;Self-assembly;Very large scale integration","VLSI;carbon nanotubes;field effect transistors;nanoelectronics;self-assembly","RDG-CNFET;nanoelectronic architecture;next generation VLSI circuits;orthogonal carbon nanotubes;programmable interconnects;reconfigurable carbon nanotube device;reconfigurable double gate carbon nanotube field effect transistor;self-assembly technology","","5","","32","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study the statistical retiming problem, where retiming is a powerful sequential transformation that relocates flip-flops in a circuit without changing its functionality. We formulate the risk aversion min-period retiming problem under process variations based on conventional two-stage stochastic program with fixed recourse and a risk aversion objective of the clock period. We prove that the proposed problem is an integer convex program, show that the subgradient of the objective function can be derived from the combinational paths with the maximum path delay, and present a heuristic incremental algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Our approach can handle arbitrary gate delay model under process variations through sampling from a black-box and the effectiveness is confirmed by the experimental results.

Inexact LZAs are normally preferred due to their shorter critical paths and reduced complexity; however, the inexact LZA requires an additional correct stage. In this paper we present a new LZA architecture that combines ideas taken from prior exact and inexact LZAs. Our new LZA improves the delay of floating point addition by 7-10% compared to state of art techniques as well as reduces hardware area in most cases.

This paper proposes an efficient compression algorithm which is capable of compressing both pre-T and post-T traces. The algorithm is based on an innovative reverse encoding scheme by reversing the order of the datum being encoded and the datum being referred. This algorithm has been successfully implemented in a realtime on-chip AHB bus tracer and has been embedded in a 3D graphics SoC as an application example.

This VCO achieved far less jitter than that of a conventional VCO. An autocalibration technique suitable for this VCO was developed to prevent the SSCG from degrading performance because of process variations. A SATA PHY using a technique for calibrating the SSCG was developed to use an inexpensive but large frequency-variation reference oscillator. This technique was used to calibrate the SSCG output-signal frequency. This is achieved by shifting an SSCG divide ratio by utilizing the difference between an SSCG output signal frequency and a received signal frequency. These techniques were fabricated in 0.13- and 0.15-mum CMOS processes. The proposed SSCG achieved a 10.0-dB reduction in EMI. The variation in the rms jitter at 1.5 GHz with spread-spectrum clocking was reduced from 2.1-7.8 ps to 1.9-3.3 ps by the proposed autocalibration technique.

Theoretical analyses and experimental results showed that the circuit generates a quite stable reference voltage of 745 mV on average. The temperature coefficient and line sensitivity of the circuit were 7 ppm/degC and 20 ppm/V, respectively. The power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) was -45 dB at 100 Hz. The circuit consists of subthreshold MOSFETs with a low-power dissipation of 0.3 muW or less and a 1.5-V power supply.

It is important to minimize the buffer size requirements of applications generated from SDF graphs, since memory space is often a scarce resource in these systems due to cost or power consumption constraints. Some authors have proposed to use model-checking for finding the minimum buffer size requirements, but the scalability of model-checking is limited by state space explosion. In this paper, we present several techniques for reducing state space size and improving scalability of model-checking by exploiting problem-specific properties of SDF graphs.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796564","","Computational modeling;Computer applications;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Multimedia systems;Power generation;Power system modeling;Scalability;Signal processing;State-space methods","data flow graphs;program verification","buffer requirements;dataflow-oriented applications;embedded systems;minimum buffer size requirements;model-checking scalability;power consumption constraints;signal processing;state space explosion;synchronous dataflow graphs","","3","","10","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional monolithic register file is not suitable for VLIW architectures with a large number of functional units. Clustered VLIW architecture is often applied, where the register file is partitioned into a number of smaller register files. Register files represent a substantial portion of the energy consumption in modern processors, and it is growing rapidly with wider instruction width. Most of the known clustered VLIW architectures partition the register file evenly among clusters. In this paper, we study the effect of energy consumption with register file re-partitioning on clustered VLIW architecture, where register files are not necessarily partitioned evenly. We present algorithms to compute energy-efficient re-partition of register files under different conditions. The impact of different intercluster communication models as well as the impact of program behavior on the register file re-partitioning are analyzed in this paper. Experimental results show that energy saving can be achieved using the proposed techniques.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796579","","VLIW","embedded systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering","VLIW architectures;energy consumption;energy saving;energy-aware register file repartitioning;energy-efficient repartition;register file","","0","","11","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evenness of the split groups is evaluated to find out some uneven parts. Then, random partial solutions for the uneven parts and random XOR constraints for the other inputs are added into constraints to get better distributed stimuli. Experimental results show that our method can evaluate the evenness as well as more complex formulae for stimulus generation, and also confirm that the self-adjusting method can improve the fault coverage ratio by more than 17% averagely with the same number of stimuli.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796573","","Automatic testing;Binary decision diagrams;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computer science;Formal verification;Hardware;Monitoring;Sampling methods","formal verification;logic gates","XOR sampling strategy;hardware verification;linear dynamic method;min-distance-sum evaluation method;self-adjusting constrained random stimulus generation;splitting evenness evaluation","","3","","17","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It performs the parameterized reduction on the original system using variation-bearing subspaces. varETBR calculates variational response Gramians by Monte-Carlo based numerical integration considering both system and input source variations for generating the projection subspace. varETBR is very scalable for the number of variables and is flexible for different variational distributions and ranges as demonstrated in experimental results. After the reduction, Monte-Carlo based statistical simulation is performed on the reduced system and the statistical responses of the original system are obtained thereafter. Experimental results, on a number of IBM benchmark circuits up to 1.6 million nodes, show that the varETBR can be 4500X faster than the Monte-Carlo method and is much more scalable than one of the recently proposed approaches.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796492","","Analytical models;Application specific integrated circuits;Circuit simulation;Leakage current;Network-on-a-chip;Power grids;Random variables;Sampling methods;Statistical analysis;Voltage","Monte Carlo methods;microprocessor chips;network analysis;power grids;statistical analysis","Monte-Carlo based numerical integration;input source variations;large power grid network analysis;model order reduction techniques;on-chip power grid networks;statistical analysis;variation-bearing subspaces;variational extended truncated balanced realization method","","0","","26","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method can provide a general framework to derive the full-chip leakage current or power in a closed form in terms of the variational parameters, such as the channel length, the gate oxide thickness, etc. It can accommodate various spatial correlations. The new method employs the orthogonal polynomials to represent the variational gate leakages in a closed form first, which is generated by a fast multi-dimensional Gaussian quadrature method. The total leakage currents then are computed by simply summing up the resulting orthogonal polynomials (their coefficients). Unlike many existing approaches, no grid-based partitioning and approximation are required. Instead, the spatial correlations are naturally handled by orthogonal decompositions. The proposed method is very efficient and it becomes linear in the presence of strong spatial correlations. Experimental results show that the proposed method is about 10times faster than the recently proposed method with constant better accuracy.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796474","","Circuits;Computer science;Gate leakage;Independent component analysis;Leakage current;Polynomials;Principal component analysis;Stochastic processes;Subthreshold current;Threshold voltage","Gaussian processes;digital circuits;leakage currents;polynomials","gate oxide thickness;multidimensional Gaussian quadrature method;orthogonal polynomials;spatial correlations;spectral stochastic method;statistical full-chip leakage power analysis method;variational gate leakages","","1","","27","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The HitME buffer is a small direct-mapped cache memory that is added as additional memory into existing cache memory hierarchies. The HitME buffer is loaded only when there is a hit on L1 cache. Otherwise, L1 cache is updated from the memory and the processor's memory request is served directly from the L1 cache. The strategy works due to the fact that 90% of memory accesses are only accessed once, and these often pollute the cache. Energy reduction is achieved by reducing the number of accesses to the L1 cache memory. Experimental results show that the use of HitME buffer will reduce the L1 cache accesses resulting in a reduction in the energy consumption of the memory hierarchy. This decrease in L1 cache accesses reduces the cache system energy consumption by an average of 60.9% when compared to traditional L1 cache memory architecture and an energy reduction of 6.4% when compared to filter cache architecture for 70 nm cache technology.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796503","","Australia;Cache memory;Computer science;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Filters;Memory management;Microprocessors;Multiplexing;Pollution","cache storage;embedded systems;integrated memory circuits","HitME;direct-mapped cache memory;embedded systems;energy consumption;low power hit memory buffer;memory hierarchy","","5","","26","","","19-22 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enable this function, we propose to build one specific heterogeneous MPSoC platform in which all heterogeneous processors are based on the same core instruction set for the operating system realization. Different extended instructions can be added for different processors to improve the system performance. Tasks can be migrated from one processor to another only if the target processor has all instructions which can meet the execution requirement of this task. This paper concentrates on the infrastructure that is necessary to support the scheduling and migration of tasks between the processors.

The first one is register binding to balance the temperature of the register file by taking both spatial and temporal thermal information into consideration. The second one is forwarding methods including forwarding-aware architecture and instruction scheduling to reduce the access count of register file.

One of the solutions to solve this problem is to use a cache. But just using a large cache may not reduce the total memory access time. We can have an optimal cache configuration which minimizes overall memory access time by varying the three cache parameters: a cache set size, a line size, and an associativity. In this paper, we propose two exact cache simulation algorithms: CRCB1 and CRCB2, based on cache inclusion property. They realize exact cache simulation but increase simulation speed dramatically. By using our approach, the number of cache hit/miss judgments required for simulating all the cache configurations is reduced to 31.4% - 93.6% compared to conventional approaches. As a result, our proposed approach totally runs an average of 1.8 times faster and a maximum of 3.3 times faster compared to the fastest approach proposed so far.

Instead, a dynamic mapping strategy, if its overheads can be kept low, may be a more promising option. In this work, we present dynamic (runtime) thread and data mappings for NoC based CMPs.

Long interconnects can be replaced by much shorter vertical through silicon via (TSV) interconnects in 3D ICs. This enables faster and more power efficient inter-core communication across multiple silicon layers. However, 3D IC technology also faces challenges due to higher power densities and routing congestion due to TSV pads distributed on each layer. In this paper, serialization of vertical TSV interconnects in 3D ICs is proposed as one way to address these challenges. Such serialization reduces the interconnect TSV footprint on each layer. This can lead to a better thermal TSV distribution resulting in lower peak temperatures, as well as more efficient core layout across multiple layers due to the reduced congestion. Experiments with several 3D multi-core benchmarks indicate clear benefits of serialization. For instance, a 4:1 serialization of TSV interconnects can save more than 70% of TSV area footprint at a negligible performance and power overhead at the 65 nm technology node.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227069","3D ICs;Networks on Chip;Serial Interconnect;VLSI","Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;Network-on-a-chip;Power system interconnection;Repeaters;Silicon;Stacking;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Through-silicon vias;Wire","integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;network routing;silicon","3D IC serial vertical interconnects;core layout;integrated circuit layout;on-chip communication bottleneck;power efficient intercore communication;routing congestion;silicon layers;size 65 nm;three-dimensional integrated circuits;vertical through silicon via interconnects","","9","","41","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To guarantee high yield, the manufactured structures must have the proper electrical characteristics despite such geometrical variations. For a designer, this means extracting the electrical characteristics of a whole family of structure realizations in order to guarantee that they all satisfy the required electrical characteristics. Sensitivity extraction provides an efficient algorithm to extract all realizations concurrently. This paper presents a complete framework for efficient resistance sensitivity extraction. The framework is based on both the finite element method (FEM) for resistance extraction and the adjoint method for sensitivity analysis. FEM enables the calculation of resistances of interconnects of arbitrary shapes, while the adjoint method enables sensitivity calculation in a computational complexity that is independent of the number of varying parameters. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated on a variety of complex examples.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227074","adjoint method;finite-element method;resistance extraction;sensitivity;shape variations","Conductors;Electric resistance;Electric variables;Finite element methods;Integrated circuit manufacture;Integrated circuit technology;Integrated circuit yield;Manufacturing;Sensitivity analysis;Shape","VLSI;computational complexity;conductors (electric);finite element analysis;sensitivity analysis;shape measurement","adjoint method;arbitrary shape;computational complexity;electrical characteristic;finite element method;integrated circuit manufacturing technique;resistance sensitivity extraction algorithm;sensitivity analysis","","1","","14","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Synchronization problems or bugs due to race conditions are particularly difficult to detect with software debugging tools. Most traditional debugging approaches rely on globally synchronized signals, but these pose problems in terms of scalability. The first contribution of this paper is to propose a novel non-uniform debug architecture (NUDA) based on a ring interconnection schema. Our approach makes debugging both feasible and scalable for many-core processing scenarios. The key idea is to distribute the debugging support structures across a set of hierarchical clusters while avoiding address overlap. This allows the address space to be monitored using non-uniform protocols. Our second contribution is a non-intrusive approach to race detection supported by the NUDA. A non-uniform page-based monitoring cache in each NUDA node is used to watch the access footprints. The union of all the caches can serve as a race detection probe. Using the proposed approach, we show that parallel race bugs can be precisely captured, and that most false-positive alerts can be efficiently eliminated at an average slowdown cost of only 1.4%~3.6%. The net hardware cost is relatively low, so that the NUDA can readily scale increasingly complex many-core systems.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227180","Architecture;Debugging;Many-core;Race detection","Access protocols;Computer architecture;Computer bugs;Costs;Monitoring;Parallel programming;Probes;Scalability;Software debugging;Watches","parallel programming;program debugging","NUDA;many-core parallel programming;nonintrusive race detection;nonuniform debugging architecture;nonuniform page-based monitoring cache;ring interconnection schema;software debugging tools","","0","","15","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When compiled into software - e.g., into sequential C code - very conservative estimation techniques have been used, where the focus has only been on obtaining safe timing estimates and not on the cost of the implementation. While this was acceptable in avionics, efficient implementations and hence tight timing estimates are needed in more cost-sensitive application domains. Lately, a number of advances in worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis techniques, coupled with the growing use of software in domains such as automotives, have led to a considerable interest in timing analysis of code generated from Esterel specifications. In this paper we propose techniques to obtain tight estimates on the processing time of input events by sequential C code generated from Esterel programs. Execution of an Esterel program - as in all other synchronous languages - is logically made up of a sequence of clock ticks. In reality, they take non-zero time which depends on the generated C code as well as the underlying hardware platform on which this code is executed. Apart from exploiting the specific structure of this C code to obtain tight WCET estimates, we capture program-level contexts across ticks in order to obtain tight estimates on response times of events whose processing spans across multiple clock ticks. Such tighter estimates immediately translate into more cost-effective implementations. Our experimental results with realistic case studies show 30% reduction in timing estimates when program level context information is taken into account.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227113","Esterel;Synchronous programming;Worst-case Execution Time (WCET) analysis","Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Delay;Hardware;Real time systems;Software safety;Synchronization;Synchronous generators;Timing","C language;sequential codes;software performance evaluation;timing","Esterel program;Esterel specification;WCET analysis;clock tick;context-sensitive timing analysis;cost-sensitive application;program level context information;program-level context;response time;sequential C code;synchronous language;timing analysis;timing estimate;worst-case execution time analysis","","0","","15","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The persistent requirements for high storage capacity have given rise to the increase of bit density per cell as in multi-level cells but this has come at the expense of performance and has resulted in degradation of durability. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach to boost the performance and durability of MLC-based storage systems by employing a non-volatile buffer that temporarily holds the data heading to MLCs. We also propose algorithms to efficiently eliminate unnecessary write and erase operations in MLCs by performing a pre-merge in the buffer. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can increase performance by up to 4 times and durability by 4 times by adding only a small hardware cost.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227140","Flash Memory;Flash Translation Layer;Storage Systems","Buffer storage;Buildings;Costs;Degradation;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy storage;Hardware;Nonvolatile memory","NAND circuits;embedded systems;flash memories","MLC-based storage system;NAND flash memory;embedded system;flash-based storage system;hierarchical architecture;high storage capacity;low energy consumption;nonvolatility energy consumption","","2","","14","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, operating systems may adapt task assignment and power management decisions to the variable characteristics of cores, improving system-wide power consumption and performance. Researchers have proposed such adaptation techniques. However, they rely on knowledge of CMP process variation (PV) maps. These maps are not provided by processor vendors, providing them would impose additional cost during the testing process, and static maps would not permit adaptation to aging effects. Further progress on developing and validating PV aware control techniques for CMPs requires access to PV maps for real processors. We present an online technique to extract the PV maps of CMPs. Potentially automatic temperature measurements with built-in on-die sensors during the execution of characterization workloads are used to determine variation in leakage power consumption. The proposed technique is applied to real CMPs, and the resulting PV maps are used within a PV aware task assignment and scheduling algorithm.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227108","Process variation;characterization;software","Aging;Automatic control;Costs;Energy consumption;Energy management;Multiprocessing systems;Operating systems;Power system management;Temperature measurement;Testing","processor scheduling;system-on-chip","PV aware task assignment-scheduling algorithm;aging effect;chip-level multiprocessor;leakage power consumption;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;power management decision;process variation characterization","","2","6","10","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This goal is accomplished by exploiting the dictionary feature of the instruction cache with a small support circuit attached to the side of the cache. The trace compression works in both the bypass mode and the online mode. Compared with related work, this work has the advantage of utilizing the existing instruction cache, which is indispensable in modern SoCs, and thus saves significant amount of hardware resource. The RTL implementation of a 4KB trace-capable instruction cache, a 4KB data cache and an academic ARM7 processor core has been accomplished. The experiments show that the cache achieves average compression ratio of 90% with a very small hardware overhead of 3652 gates. In addition, the trace support circuit does not impact the global critical path.

As electronics becomes ubiquitous, LSIs are expected to be more widely used in ultra-small low-power electronic devices for various applications such as electronic tags, credit cards, and so on. This strong demand in new application domain leads to increased requirements against LSIs; high functionality, high security and low power-consumption are more strongly required for LSIs than ever.

The key innovation in our proposed work is a hybrid memory array, which is mixture of conventional 6T and 8T SRAM bit-cells. The fundamental premise of our approach lies in the fact that human visual system (HVS) is mostly sensitive to higher order bits of luminance pixels in video data. We implemented a preferential storage policy in which the higher order luma bits are stored in robust 8T bit-cells while the lower order bits are stored in conventional 6T bit-cells. This facilitates aggressive scaling of supply voltage in memory as the important luma bits, stored in 8T bit-cells, remain relatively unaffected by voltage scaling. The not-so-important lower order luma bits, stored in 6T bit-cells, if affected, contribute insignificantly to the overall degradation in output video quality. Simulation results show average power savings of up to 56%, in the hybrid memory array compared to the conventional 6T SRAM array implemented in 65nm CMOS. The area overhead and maximum output quality degradation (PSNR) incurred were 11.5% and 0.56 dB, respectively.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227102","Graceful degradation;Low power SRAM;Supply voltage over-scaling","Degradation;Humans;MPEG 4 Standard;Memory architecture;Power dissipation;Random access memory;Robustness;Technological innovation;Visual system;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;SRAM chips;video codecs","CMOS process;MPEG-4 video processors;SRAM architecture;human visual system;hybrid memory array;luminance pixels;process variation;size 65 nm;video quality;voltage scaling","","3","","12","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, we adapt a new code compression approach called Burrows-Wheeler (BW) which has been used before in data compression. It significantly reduces the code size compared to state-of-the-art approaches for VLIW processors.

In this paper we address the problem of estimating the actual temperature of on-chip thermal sensor when the sensor reading has been corrupted by noise. Thermal sensors are prone to noise due to fabrication randomness, VDD fluctuations etc. This causes discrepancy between actual temperature and the one predicted by thermal sensor. Our experiments estimate this variation to be around 30%. In this paper we present a statistical methodology for predicting the actual temperature for a given sensor reading. We present two techniques: single sensor prediction and multi-sensor prediction. The latter tries to estimate the actual temperature for each sensor (of the many on-chip sensors) simultaneously while exploiting the correlations between temperature and noise of different sensors. When the underlying randomness follows a Gaussian characteristic, we present optimal schemes of estimating the expected temperature. We also present heuristic schemes for the case where the Gaussian assumption fails to hold. The experiments showed that using our estimation schemes the RMS error can be reduce as much as 67% as compared to blindly trusting the sensors to be noise free.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227040","DTM;Estimation;Multicore;On-chip Sensor;Temperature","Fabrication;Fluctuations;Multicore processing;Noise reduction;Runtime;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Statistical analysis;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors;Thermal sensors","Gaussian processes;system-on-chip;temperature sensors;thermal management (packaging)","DTM;Gaussian characteristic;RMS error;dynamic thermal management;multicore SOC;multisensor prediction;on-chip sensor;runtime thermal measurement;single sensor prediction;statistical methodology;temperature estimation;thermal sensor","","5","","19","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HTH attacks can greatly comprise security and privacy of hardware users either directly or through interaction with pertinent systems and application software or with data. However, while there has been a huge research and development effort for detecting software Trojan horses, surprisingly, HTHs are rarely addressed. HTH detection is a particularly difficult task in modern and pending deep submicron technologies due to intrinsic manufacturing variability. Our goal is to provide an impetus for HTH research by creating a generic and easily applicable set of techniques and tools for HTH detection. We start by introducing a technique for recovery of characteristics of gates in terms of leakage current, switching power, and delay, which utilizes linear programming to solve a system of equations created using nondestructive measurements of power or delays. This technique is combined with constraint manipulation techniques to detect embedded HTHs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of standard benchmarks.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227106","Hardware Trojan horses;gate-level characterization;linear programming;manufacturing variability","Application software;Data privacy;Data security;Foundries;Hardware;Invasive software;Manufacturing;Research and development;Software libraries;Testing","integrated circuits;invasive software;linear programming;logic gates;power aware computing","gate level characterization;hardware Trojan horse detection;hardware specification;linear programming;nondestructive power measurements","","19","7","16","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our basic approach to emulation involves constructing a model of the target architecture by composing simplified hardware models of key datacenter building blocks, including switches, routers, links, and servers. Since models in our system are implemented in programmable hardware, designers have full control over emulated buffer sizes, line rates, topologies, and many other network properties. Full system control also gives researchers a significant degree of system visibility. Additionally, because our node model emulates servers using a full SPARC v8 ISA compatible processor, each node in the network is capable of running real applications. This allows researchers to study a network under complex real-world workloads at a scale that matches that of a large datacenter today. Moreover, because the system is a private testbed, experiments can be deterministic and therefore reproduced by other researchers. Lastly, the system is cost effective for designers, and we show that using FPGA technology on the market today we can actually emulate a network of 256-nodes for about $2,000.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227122","Datacenter Networking;Hardware Modeling","Control systems;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Network servers;Network topology;Size control;Switches;Web server","Internet;computer centres;field programmable gate arrays;microprocessor chips","FPGA-based tool;Internet-in-a-box datacenter network emulator;datacenter building block;emulated buffer size;full SPARC v8 ISA compatible processor;full system control;line rate;programmable hardware;system visibility;topology","","1","","12","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new SAT solver that operates on the negation normal form (NNF) of the given Boolean formulas/circuits. The NNF of a formula is usually more succinct than the CNF of the formula in terms of the number of variables. Our algorithm applies the DPLL algorithm to the graph-based representations of NNF formulas. We adapt the idea of the two-watched-literal scheme from CNF SAT solvers in order to efficiently carry out Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP), a key task in the DPLL algorithm. We evaluate the new solver on a large collection of Boolean circuit benchmarks obtained from formal verification problems.

The clock latency range (CLR), which is the latency difference under different supply voltages, is defined by the 2009 ACM ISPD Clock Network Synthesis Contest as the major optimization objective to measure the effects of process variation on clock-tree synthesis. In this paper, we propose a three-level framework which effectively constructs clock trees by performing blockage-avoiding buffer insertion with both nominal skew and CLR minimization. To cope with the objectives, we present a novel three-stage TTR clock-tree construction algorithm which consists of clock-tree Topology Generation, Tapping-Point Determination, and Routing.

This work develops an efficient three-stage clock tree synthesis flow for CLR minimization. Firstly, a balanced clock tree with small skew is generated. Secondly, buffer insertion and wire sizing minimizes delay variation without violating the slew constraint. Finally, skew is minimized by inserting snaking wires.

In contrast to non-linear methods, linear MbT&D methods only require matrix operations associated with relatively low computational effort. A modification of the linear MbT&D in combination with Volterra series is presented that can be applied to cascaded non-linear systems, for example, a DAC followed by a low-pass filter. A simultaneous identification of numerous frequency domain Volterra kernels is enabled, and thus, to test the compliance to data sheet specifications.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090930","","Baseband;Distortion measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Kernel;Low pass filters;NIST;Nonlinear filters;Radio frequency;System testing;Transceivers","Volterra series;cascade networks;digital-analogue conversion;frequency-domain analysis;low-pass filters;nonlinear systems","Volterra series;digital-to-analog converter;frequency domain Volterra kernel;linear model-based diagnosis;linear model-based testing;low-pass filter;nonlinear cascaded mixed-signal system;single-block module;static nonlinear transfer characteristics","","0","","23","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Wire synthesizable global routing for timing closure","Moffitt, M.D.; Sze, C.N.","IBM Corp., Austin, TX, USA","Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC), 2011 16th Asia and South Pacific","20110303","2011","","","545","550","Despite remarkable progress in the area of global routing, the burdens imposed by modern physical synthesis flows are far greater than those expected or anticipated by available (academic) routing engines. As interconnects dominate the path delay, physical synthesis such as buffer insertion and gate sizing has to integrate with layer assignment. Layer directives - commonly generated during wire synthesis to meet tight frequency targets - play a critical role in reducing interconnect delay of smaller technology nodes. Unfortunately, they are not presently understood or honored by leading global routers, nor do existing techniques trivially extend toward their resolution. The shortcomings contribute to a dangerous blindspot in optimization and timing closure, leading to unroutable and/or underperforming designs. In this paper, we aim to resolve the layer compliance problem in routing congestion evaluation and global routing, which is very critical for timing closure with physical synthesis. We propose a method of progressive projection to account for wire tags and layer directives, in which classes of nets are successively applied and locked while performing partial aggregation. The method effectively models the resource contention of layer constraints by faithfully accumulating capacity of bounded layer ranges, enabling three-dimensional assignment to subsequently achieve complete directive compliance. The approach is general, and can piggyback on existing interfaces used to communicate with popular academic engines. Empirical results on the IC-CAD 2009 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach successfully routes many designs that are otherwise unroutable with existing techniques and naiÌve approaches.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722249","","Benchmark testing;Delay;Metals;Routing;Three dimensional displays;Wire","VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;optimisation","interconnect delay;optimization;routing engines;tight frequency targets;timing closure;wire synthesizable global routing","","2","1","28","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Testing the analog and mixed-signal circuitry of a mixed-signal IC has become a difficult task. This is due to the fact that most analog and mixed signal circuits are tested by its functionality, which is both time consuming and expensive. Hence the importance of developing efficient and optimized test techniques dedicated to data converter products is evident. A novel built-in self-test scheme for testing on-chip digital to analog converters is proposed in this paper. This scheme employs an on-chip ramp signal generation for testing the converters. DACs considered for testing are R-2R, charge scaling and current steering DACs. The DAC architectures exhibit better performance with low INL and DNL of <0.5 LSB. The proposed BIST architecture is validated by testing all the DAC architectures with structural fault models. The proposed BIST provides average fault coverage of 95.22%. This paper presents the design of different DACs and the novel BIST architecture for testing the converters. All individual blocks in this paper are designed and simulated using Tspice with 0.18 mum CMOS technology.","","978-1-4244-4789-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204364","Analog to Digital converter (ADC);Built-In-Self-Test (BIST);Ramp generator","Analog integrated circuits;Built-in self-test;CMOS technology;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Digital-analog conversion;Electrical fault detection;Integrated circuit testing;System testing;System-on-a-chip","CMOS integrated circuits;SPICE;VLSI;built-in self test;digital-analogue conversion;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;ramp generators;system-on-chip","BIST architecture;CMOS technology;DAC;SOC design;Tspice;VLSI circuits;built-in self-test scheme;digital-analog converters;fault detection;mixed-signal circuit;on-chip ramp signal generation;structural fault models;system-on-chip design","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
