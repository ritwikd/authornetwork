"Electrical design and design automation for packaging","Becker, D.","IBM Corp., Poughkeepsie, NY, USA","Design Automation Conference, 1999. Proceedings of the ASP-DAC '99. Asia and South Pacific","20020806","1999","","","11 suppl.","","One important challenge in the electrical design of electronic packaging is encountered in the many systems requiring processors operating at clock frequencies in the hundreds of Megahertz. The competition to provide higher performance computers results in an increasing number of processors in a system and these processors are running at faster clock frequencies. The package needs to support wider buses at higher frequencies to connect the processors with each other and with cache and main memory data storage. Since the interconnects must run without interruption, the timing and noise characteristics of these paths must be characterized and managed. The short design cycle is supported by including the management of the timing and noise characteristics as an integral part of the high-level system design at the beginning of the project and then verifying that the same constraints are met for the formal design review before the finished designs are released into manufacturing. The principles we follow to design the packaging for multi-processor systems are presented. A methodology for design will be described which defines budgets and equations to efficiently calculate the timing and noise on the interconnects. This provides a means to include the electrical considerations in the optimal cost-performance choice of technology. The budgets and equations are then integrated into the design tools and provide guidance in the design of the power and signal distribution and the means for thorough post-design verification of the electrical performance of the package in the system","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760045","","Clocks;Design automation;Electronics packaging;Frequency;High performance computing;Manufacturing;Memory;Project management;Signal design;Timing","electronic design automation;packaging","buses;design automation;design cycle;electrical considerations;electrical design;formal design review;high-level system design;multi-processor systems;noise characteristics;optimal cost-performance choice;packaging;post-design verification;signal distribution;timing","","0","","2","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The innovation of LSI design methodology will be the most effective way to resolve the issues of the design crisis. SIRIJ, Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan, has organized `VCDS Committee' to research the next generation EDA system towards 2010. `VCDS: Virtual Core based Design System' is proposed as the next generation EDA system to solve the issues of the design crisis. VCDS provides designers with VCs: Virtual Cores and the VC based design methodology to reduce the design time and the power consumption of system LSI for electronic systems drastically. VCDS technologies are based on hardware/software codesign and IP re-use methodologies. VCDS consists of VCDB (VC Data Base), VCPF (VC Platform), System Synthesizer and VC Synthesizer. VCDB stores high level and flexible IPs called VCs (Virtual Cores). The VCs are defined as abstract and flexible functionality at system level and are categorized by the application domains. The designer stores VCs in the VCDB by use of the registration tool of VCPF and search and instantiate them from the database via VCPF. System Synthesizer of VCDS consists of system specification definition tools, evaluation tools for hardware/software tradeoff and validation/verification, optimization tools for hardware/software codesign, the generation tools for system architecture, and the software generation tools for software compiler and software development environment. The generated system architecture consists of hardware VCs and software VCs. VC Synthesizer generates the physical design of each VC in the system architecture. VCDS is proposed as the next generation EDA system to make the solution of the coming design crisis. VCDS makes designers to define the system specification by selecting system level VCs and decide the optimum combination of hardware/software efficiently","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760041","","Computer architecture;Design methodology;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware;Large scale integration;Productivity;Software tools;Synthesizers;Technological innovation;Virtual colonoscopy","electronic design automation;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;large scale integration;software development management","IP re-use methodologies;LSI;SEMATECH;SIRIJ;Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan;VC Synthesizer;VCDB;VCDS;VCPF;application domains;design productivity;design time;evaluation tools;hardware/software codesign;next generation EDA system;physical design;power consumption;registration tool;software development environment;software generation tools;system specification definition tools;virtual core based design system","","0","","","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development cycle for design is discussed in some detail and the criticality of comprehensive analysis to ensure successful design is discussed. It is demonstrated that successful integration of diverse functional and reliability requirements requires thorough studies of design options. The current state of the art in design synthesis and analysis tools is reviewed. It is suggested that design tools still need improvements in connectivity between electrical layout and thermal and mechanical analysis/synthesis tools. Another issue that needs greater emphasis is the issue of dimensional scale transitions in analyses at the die level vs those at the package and system levels.

Consumerization and convergence applications are causing tremendous time to market pressures, resulting in increased product complexity and reduced design cycle times. The gap between what can be built (silicon capacity) and what can be designed is widening. This `design productivity gap' is causing an industry-wide shift to system-on-a-chip (SOC) design methodology. The corner-stone for success of the SOC methodology is design re-use. The methodology for design re-use will evolve going forward. Huge investments will be made to setup infrastructure and methodologies for creation of re-usable designs and their integration into future products.

This is because this switch influences the speed, area, and power of a low-voltage LSI. This paper describes the influences of the power switch on the circuit performance in detail, and proposes a systematic method for designing a power switch which takes them into consideration for the first time. The main feature of this method, called the average-current method, is the use of the average current consumed in an LSI to determine the power-switch size. This makes it easy for designers to determine the minimum size of the power-switch needed to satisfy the required speed, which results in minimizing the area penalty and the standby power. Useful analytical formula and the practical determination flow are also described. Measurement of an actual 0.25 μm MTCMOS/SIMOX 290-Kgate LSI operating at 1 V confirmed the effectiveness of this method. This method estimated well the required power-switch width, and as a result it reduced the area penalty and standby current by about 80% compared to the conventional design scheme","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.759726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759726","","CMOS logic circuits;Design methodology;Laboratories;Large scale integration;Leakage current;Logic design;Logic gates;MOSFETs;Power supplies;Switches","CMOS logic circuits;field effect transistor switches;high-speed integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;large scale integration;low-power electronics;power semiconductor switches","0.25 micron;1 V;LV high-speed LSIs;MTCMOS power switch;MTCMOS/SIMOX LSI;area penalty reduction;average-current method;circuit performance;design method;low-voltage LSI;multi-threshold voltage CMOS;power-switch size determination;standby current reduction","","21","6","6","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From these projections of the overall technology characteristics are derived for the needs for packaging and assembly technologies that support and enable this dynamic growth. In the present paper, we shall provide detailed discussions of the potential solutions for the high density substrates and the issues that the wafer development brings to the creation of packaging solutions for future electronic systems. The most apparent changes to the packaging technology requirements changes have been driven by the increase in chip speed and functionality, the materials set for wafer level interconnect, and the power requirements. These quantities have driven the derived needs for greater and greater interconnect to and from the chip, different materials for packaging solutions, more effective thermal management, and software systems to design and model it all. The package is also shrinking to meet the miniaturization requirements of many of the hand-held products.

Efficient analysis of the effects of parameter variations (cache dimensions, degree of associativity, replacement policy, line size, …) is at the same time an essential and very time-consuming aspect of embedded system design, whose complexity increases when multi-tasking and real-time aspects must be considered. We propose a new simulation-based methodology, focused on an approximate model of the cache and of the multi-tasking reactive software, that allows one to trade off smoothly between accuracy and simulation speed. In particular, we propose to accurately consider intra-task conflicts, but approximate inter-task conflicts by considering only a finite number of previous task executions. The rationale for this choice can be found in a common pattern in embedded systems, where a “normal” data flow results in a regular intra-task common flow, interrupted from time to time by some urgent event, that pessimistically can be consider as disrupting the cache behavior. The approach is conservative because re-execution of a task after a large amount of time will always be considered as not in cache, and the simulation speed-up is considerable, as shown by theoretical analysis and experimental results","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760030","","Analytical models;Application software;Cache memory;Costs;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Real time systems;Software design;Software performance","cache storage;data flow computing;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign","associativity;cache dimensions;cache memories;data flow;embedded systems;hardware/software co-design environment;instruction cache simulation strategies;intra-task conflicts;line size;multi-tasking;parameter variations;real-time aspects;replacement policy;simulation speed;simulation speed-up","","3","","8","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Revolutionary design methodologies are required from various aspects, such as software design accomplished in parallel with hardware design, built-in analog/sensor functionality of human interface and shorter time-to-market design style because of shorter product life cycle. Under the above situation, EDA Technical Committee in EIAJ (Electronic Industries Association of Japan) organized “EDA Vision Working Group” for investigation of desired design methodologies of system LSIs in 2002. Started in September 1996, the working group has completed “EDA Technology Roadmap Toward 2002”. The working group defined targeted system LSIs called “Cyber-Giga-Chip”, which will be widely used in consumer portable information applications, and would be the major products in domestic semiconductor industry. EDA needs and corresponding requirements are studied through detailed interviews with advanced experts of LSI designers as well as EDA engineers. “EDA Technology Roadmap Toward 2002” finally summarizes those EDA requirements into a set of roadmaps which indicates potential To Be solutions needed toward 2002 or beyond.

In this survey we evaluate and analyze Japanese design capability relative to the USA's, proposing possible suggestions to prepare for such reformations. Complexity of LSI is measured by an adequately normalized transistor count (NTC), then `design productivity' is defined as NTC per person-week. Seven factors influencing design capability are selected: team, management, EDA, reuse, business, specification and implementation. 21 ASSP design teams (11 Japanese, 10 US) were chosen and interviewed based on a detailed questionnaire on these metrics/factors, and the acquired data compared by US/Japan averages. NTC ranges around from 100 K to 2 M, averaging at 700 K in both countries. Japanese (J) `productivity' is a bit higher while its `production rate (NTC per week)' is lower (losing TTM) than USA's. Factor analysis indicates (all the figures are normalized by NTC): J team size is half of US's; J spends bigger money on EDA and longer time in simulation, but shorter time in verification; J consumes 2.5 times more respins; J loses much more TTM, in more than half the cases due to manager-controllable factors such as design bug, design spec, change, and process tech change. Derived suggestions for Japan are: double the number of engineers per team; reexamine design management in order to reduce fatal bugs and respins; improve EDA quality and reuse quantity; examine and solve perception gaps between managers and engineers about their targets like high quality, reuse, and TTM","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760040","","Analytical models;Design engineering;Electronic design automation and methodology;Engineering management;Financial management;Large scale integration;Production;Productivity;Quality management;Time to market","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;large scale integration","ASSP design teams;LSI;TTM;design capability;design management;design productivity;design technology;design/EDA capabilities;management;production rate;productivity;reuse quantity;specification","","0","","","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These performance issues are critical today and are fast becoming more complex than current CAD tool trends will be able to support. For example, in today's digital systems, the package design is an important part of the signal integrity equation, and a major determinant of board routing costs. The concentration is on signal integrity management. However, in tomorrow's systems, the promise of high density packaging presents novel integration opportunities that will require new design approaches beyond just managing signal integrity; other connectivity and performance issues will enter into play. For today's RF and analog systems, the package is part of the load and antenna environment and again presents a difficult signal integrity analysis. In tomorrow's systems, new technologies and higher performance/frequency requirements will require system modeling solutions far superior to those offered today. In both types of systems, the package design is starting to require the sophistication normally reserved for the IC design. It is time for the packaging CAD tools to recognize this trend and prepare for it. The author reviews these system design trends and gives examples from work performed at NCSU and elsewhere. He also presents the state of the art for CAD support for chip-package codesign and postulates that the continuation of current trends will not give satisfactory solutions for future systems. It is argued that a new approach is needed, one hinging on codesigning the package, chip and system in a unified chip-centric environment while maintaining suitable levels of abstraction to permit interaction across inter-disciplinary teams","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760047","","Circuit optimization;Costs;Design automation;Digital systems;Loaded antennas;Packaging;RF signals;Radio frequency;Routing;Signal design","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit packaging","CAD tool trends;chip-package codesign;connectivity;future systems;high density packaging;overall circuit performance;package design;performance issues;signal integrity equation;signal integrity management;system modeling solutions;unified chip-centric environment","","1","","","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The logic synthesis process can optimize circuit delay based on accurate interconnect delay information extracted from the physical design. The physical design tools can refine the layout incrementally with the engineering change information and changed netlist passed from the logic synthesis process.

Due to their time efficiency, IIP algorithms are widely used in VLSI circuit partitioning. As the performance of these algorithms depends on choices of moving cells, various such methods have been proposed. In particular, the cluster-removal algorithm by S. Dutt significantly improved partition quality. We indicate the weaknesses of previous algorithms using a uniform method for the choice of cells during improvement. To solve this problem, we propose a new IIP technique that selects the method for choice of cells according to improvement status and presents hybrid bucket structures for easy implementation. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is the same as the FM method, and the experimental results on ACM/SIGDA benchmark circuits show improvement up to 33-44%, 45-50% and 10-12% in cutsize over FM, LA-3 and CLIP respectively.

However, the original implementation of the algorithm destroys the sparsity of the internal capacitance matrix. Consequently, the LASO process, used in the computation of the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, becomes very time-consuming. Therefore, the efficiency of the algorithm needs to be improved. In this paper, a new method to implement the PACT algorithm is presented. In order to maintain the sparsity of the matrices, we use a special Lanczos algorithm to directly compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors by solving a large sparse symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem, At the same time, this approach can avoid some matrix multiplication to speed up the reduction process. We have constructed a RC reduction tool with the new implementation method.

In this phase, an exponential weight function is used to guide the flow distribution which is very helpful in distributing wires, globally and uniformly, on the whole routing area. Then a physical routing phase is applied to implement one-to-one connection between chip pads and I/O pins, which focuses on the wire uniformity of the fanout area nearby the periphery of chip pads. Finally, a balanced position based wire polishing approach is proposed to further improve the local wire uniformity which tries to modify each wire into a smooth curve instead of broken line while satisfying the specified design rules such as wire-wire pitch and wire-pin pitch. A routing cost function is adequately defined to guide the whole routing process which leads to a good trade-off between wire uniformity and wire length.

In order to handle sequential circuits, we equate latch outputs with primary inputs for the upper bound estimation and use a logic simulator to determine the initial values for the lower bound estimation. Based on the information obtained, we model all blocks in the circuit as voltage-controlled current sources, with the analog hardware description language (AHDL). After extracting parasitic resistances of the power supply lines, we simulate the entire circuit using an analog simulator and obtain the maximum current estimation and voltage drops in the supply lines. In the modeling procedure we take the negative feedback influence into consideration such that the estimated current reflects a real switching transition.

The bipartitioning process is continued until the number of clusters is equal to the required number of partitions.

But despite the huge effort spent, up to now, to design different reordering heuristics, their performance often does not meet the needs of the applications. In many OBDD-based computations, the time cost for reordering dominates the time spent by the computation itself. There are some known approaches for accelerating the reordering by taking advantage of structural properties of OBDDs and functions represented. In this paper, we propose a reordering method that exploits application specific information. The main idea is to drive the reordering process by the computation. This effects an acceleration of the whole computation rather than of the reordering only.

They guarantee the complete diagnosis of multiple interconnect faults with no aliasing and confounding. The algorithms have been evaluated by simulation on several benchmark layouts and randomly generated layouts.

The hybrid clustering algorithm consisting of a local bottom-up clustering technique to merge modules and a global top-down ratio-cut technique for decomposition can be used to reduce the partitioning complexity and improve the performance. To generate a high-quality partitioning solution, a module migration based partitioning algorithm MMP is also proposed as the base partitioner for the TLP algorithm. The MMP algorithm implicitly promotes the move of clusters during the module migration processes by paying more attention to the neighbors of moved modules, relaxing the size constraints temporarily during the migration process, and controlling the module migration direction. Experimental results obtained show that the TLP algorithm generates stable and high-quality partitioning results. The TLP algorithm improves the unstable property of module migration based algorithms such as FM and STABLE in terms of the average net cut value.

We determine f(x) such that T<sub>D</sub> is minimized. We also extend our study to the case where a non-uniform wire has two neighboring wires.

Furthermore, the PFD has a dead zone less than 0.01 ns in the phase characteristics and has low phase sensitivity errors. The phase and frequency error detection range is not limited as in the case of the pt-type and nc-type PFDs. Also, the PFD is independent from the duty cycle of input signals. A new charge-pump circuit is presented that is designed using a charge-amplifier. A stand-by current enhances the speed of charge-pump and removes the charge-sharing which causes a phase noise in the charge-pump PLL. Also, the effects of clock feed-through are reduced by separating the output stage from UP and down signal. The simulation results base on a third-order PLL are presented to verify the lock-in process with the proposed PFD and charge-pump circuits.

This simulator uses a variation of the periodic noise analysis first proposed by Okumura, et al (1993). It computes the power spectral density of the noise as a function of frequency. By assuming that only white noise sources are present in the oscillator, it is possible to derive a simple relationship between the level of the phase noise and the jitter. This excludes flicker noise from consideration, however, since flicker noise is a low-frequency phenomenon, excluding it only affects the accuracy of the long-term jitter. We compared the jitter with measurement and found the error to be less than 2 dB. An AHDL model for the VCO that efficiently exhibits jitter in the time domain is included. The model was written in Verilog-A. This model can be used to determine the affect of VCO jitter on a larger system, such as a phase-locked loop (PLL)","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.759717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759717","","1f noise;Analytical models;Circuit noise;Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Radio frequency;Voltage-controlled oscillators","circuit noise;circuit simulation;jitter;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators;white noise","AHDL model;PLL;RF circuit simulator;SpectreRF;VCO jitter simulation;Verilog-A;flicker noise;periodic noise analysis;phase noise;phase-locked loop;power spectral density;voltage controlled oscillator;white noise sources","","17","4","8","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are several previous works (Young and Wong, 1998 and 1999; Young et al, 1999; Murata et al, 1997; Chang et al, 2000) focusing on a few particular kinds of placement constraint. In this paper, we present the first ""unified method"" to handle all of them simultaneously, including pre-placed constraint, range constraint, boundary constraint, alignment, abutment and clustering, etc., in general nonslicing floorplans. We have used incremental updates and an interesting reduced graphs idea to improve the runtime of the algorithm. We tested our method using some benchmark data with about one eighth of the modules having placement constraints and the results are very promising. Good packing with all the constraints satisfied can be obtained efficiently","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995011","","Benchmark testing;Circuit optimization;Circuit testing;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data engineering;Design engineering;Design optimization;Runtime;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;modules","I/O connection;abutment;algorithm runtime;alignment;benchmark data;boundary constraint;clustering;data path alignment;final packing;floorplan design;module positions;nonslicing floorplans;packing constraints;placement constraint;placement constraints;placement constraints handling;pre-placed constraint;range constraint;reduced graphs;unified method","","3","1","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently there has been renewed interest in this problem due to the need for highly scalable algorithms able to handle nets with tens of thousands of terminals. In this paper we give a practical O(n log<sup>2</sup> n) heuristic for computing near-optimal rectilinear Steiner trees based on a hatched version of the greedy triple contraction algorithm of Zelikovsky (Algorithmica vol. 9, pp. 463-470, 1993). Experiments conducted on both random and industry test cases show that our heuristic matches or exceeds the quality of best known RSMT heuristics, e.g. on random instances with more than 100 terminals our heuristic improves over the rectilinear minimum spanning tree by an average of 11%. Moreover, our heuristic has very good runtime scaling, e.g. it can route a 34k-terminals net extracted from a real design in less than 25 seconds compared to over 86 minutes needed by the O(n<sup>2</sup>) edge-based heuristic of Borah, Owens, and Irwin (Discrete Appl. Math. vol. 90, pp. 51-67, 1999). Since our heuristic is graph-based, it can be easily modified to handle practical considerations such as routing obstacles, preferred directions, via costs, and octilinear routing - indeed, experimental results show only a small factor increase in runtime when switching from rectilinear to octilinear routing.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195132","","Computer science;Costs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Research and development;Routing;Runtime;Silicon;Steiner trees;Testing;Tree graphs","VLSI;algorithm theory;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","25 s;86 min;RSMT;RSMT heuristics;edge-based heuristic;electronic design automation;graph-based heuristic;greedy triple contraction algorithm;minimum-length interconnection;net routing time;octilinear Steiner trees;octilinear routing;preferred directions;rectilinear Steiner minimum tree problem;rectilinear Steiner trees;rectilinear minimum spanning tree;rectilinear plane terminals;rectilinear routing;routing obstacles;runtime scaling;scalable algorithms;via costs","","16","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design of the control logic of nonlinear pipelines has however, been considered as a subsidiary issue in that an RTL description for such logic can easily be obtained from a behavioral description, with the use of widely available synthesis tools. But, as the complexity of a nonlinear pipeline increases, so does the complexity of the control logic. The complexity may be to an extent that obtaining even a behavioral description for the control logic is rendered difficult. We focus on further automating the development of systems consisting of nonlinear or multifunction pipelines by proposing an algorithmic technique for obtaining a behavioral description for the control logic of such pipelines. A simplified C++ implementation that produces a VHDL description of the control logic is then presented to clarify the algorithm. Experimental results that reveal connections between the nature of pipeline functions and the complexity of the control logic, obtained by utilization of the algorithm, are also presented. Consideration of these results can reduce the design space exploration of such pipelines to a more practically feasible subspace.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337545","","Automatic control;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Control system synthesis;Delay;High level synthesis;Latches;Logic design;Pipelines;Space exploration","hardware description languages;logic design;pipeline processing","C++ implementation;RTL description;VHDL description;behavioral description;control logic;design space exploration;nonlinear pipelines","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent works by Cong, Kong and Pan (1999) and Tang and Wong (2000) give algorithms to solve the buffer block planning problem. In this paper, we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global multiterminal nets given an existing buffer block plan. We give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999) [see also Albrecht (2000) and Dragan et al. (2000)]. Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. In addition, our algorithm allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection and observes buffer parity constraints. Most importantly, and unlike previous works on the problem, we take into account multiterminal nets. Our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for the problem, which are based on 2-pin decompositions of the nets.

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","38","41","Nonrectangular (rectilinear) shape occurs very often in deep submicron floorplanning. Most previous algorithms are designed to handle only convex rectilinear blocks. However, handling concave rectilinear shape is necessary since a simple ""U"" shape is concave. A few works could address concave rectilinear block explicitly. In (K. Fujiyoshi, et al., (1999)), a necessary and sufficient condition of feasible sequence pair is proposed for arbitrary rectilinear shape in terms of constraint graph. However, no constraint is imposed on sequence pair representation itself. The search for feasible sequence pair mainly depends on the simulated annealing, which implies unnecessary inefficiency. In many cases, it takes very long time or even is unable to find the feasible placement. Furthermore, it takes O(n<sup>3</sup>) runtime to evaluate each sequence pair, which leaves much space for improvement. We propose a new method to handle arbitrary rectilinear shape constraint based on sequence pair representation. We explore the topological property of feasible sequence pair, and use it to eliminate lots of infeasible sequence pairs, which implies speeding up the convergence of simulated annealing process. The evaluation of a sequence pair is based on longest common subsequence computation, and achieves significantly faster runtime (O(mnloglogn) time where m is the number of rectilinear-shape constraints, n is the number of rectangular blocks/subblocks). The algorithm can handle fixed-frame floorplanning and min-area floorplanning as well.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337536","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Ear;Lakes;Runtime;Shape;Simulated annealing;Sufficient conditions;Topology;Very large scale integration","circuit layout CAD;computational complexity;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","arbitrary rectilinear shape constraint;concave rectilinear block;constraint graph;fixed-frame floorplanning;longest common subsequence computation;min-area floorplanning;sequence pair representation;simulated annealing;submicron floorplanning;topological property","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Buffer insertion/sizing is one of the most effective and popular techniques to reduce interconnect delay and decouple coupling effects. It is traditionally applied to post-layout optimization. However, it is obviously infeasible to insert/size hundreds of thousands of buffers during the post-layout stage when most routing regions are occupied. Therefore, it is desirable to incorporate buffer planning into floorplanning to ensure timing closure and design convergence. In this paper, we first derive formulae of buffer insertion for timing and noise optimization, and then apply the formulae to compute the feasible regions for inserting buffers to meet both timing and noise constraints. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an average success rate of 80.9% (78.2%) of nets meeting timing constraints alone (both timing and noise constraints) and consumes an average extra area of only 0.49% (0.66%) over the given floorplan, compared with the average success rate of 75.6% of nets meeting timing constraints alone and an extra area of 1.33% by the BBP method (J.
