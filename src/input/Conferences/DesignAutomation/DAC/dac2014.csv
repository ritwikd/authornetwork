Existing HLS tools are successful in synthesizing efficient accelerators for program kernels with regular memory accesses and simple control flows. For other programs, however, these tools yield poor performance because they invoke computation units for instructions sequentially, without exploiting parallelism. To address this problem, this paper proposes Coarse-Grained Pipelined Accelerators (CGPA), an HLS framework that utilizes coarse-grained pipeline parallelism techniques to synthesize efficient specialized accelerator modules from irregular C/C++ programs without requiring any annotations. Compared to the sequential method, CGPA shows speedups of 3.0x-3.8x for 5 kernels from programs in different domains.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881405","","Hardware;Hardware design languages;Kernel;Pipeline processing;Pipelines","high level synthesis;parallel processing;pipeline processing","CGPA;HLS tools;coarse-grained pipeline parallelism techniques;coarse-grained pipelined accelerators;control flows;high-level synthesis tools;irregular C/C++ programs;nonrecurring engineering cost;program kernels;regular memory accesses;sequential method;specialized accelerator modules;specialized hardware accelerators","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Computation offloading by using timing unreliable components in real-time systems","Wei Liu; Jian-Jia Chen; Anas; Tei-Wei Kuo; Qingxu Deng","Northeastern Univ., Shenyang, China","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20140821","2014","","","1","6","There are many timing unreliable computing components in modern computer systems, which are typically forbidden in hard real-time systems due to the timing uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading mechanism to utilise these timing unreliable components in a hard real-time system, by providing local compensations. The key of the mechanism is to decide (1) how the unreliable components are utilized and (2) how to set the worst-case estimated response time. The local compensation has to start when the unreliable components do not deliver the results in the estimated response time. We propose a scheduling algorithm and its schedulability test to analyze the feasibility of the compensation mechanism. To validate the proposed mechanism, we perform a case study based on image-processing applications in a robot system and simulations. By adopting the timing unreliable components, the system can handle higher-quality images and with better performance.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881366","","Abstracts;Graphics processing units;Timing","embedded systems;scheduling","compensation mechanism;computation offloading mechanism;embedded systems;estimated response time;hard real-time systems;image-processing;modern computer systems;robot system;schedulability test;scheduling algorithm;timing uncertainty;timing unreliable computing components","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sheer number of component types (analog, digital, mixed-signal) and sizes (large or small) makes it extremely challenging to find a one-size-fits-all solution to detect and prevent recycled ICs. In this paper, we propose a suite of solutions for combating die and IC recycling (CDIR). These solutions include light-weight, on-chip structures based on ring oscillators (RO-CDIR), anti-fuses (AF-CDIR) and fuses (F-CDIR). Each structure meets the unique needs and limitations of different part types and sizes providing excellent coverage of recycled parts. HSPICE simulation results using 90nm technology demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware RO-CDIR for detecting ICs used for very short period of time. Recycling of large digital ICs can effectively be detected by using AF-CDIR. Small analog and digital recycled components can be identified by testing our F-CDIR with very low cost measurement devices, e.g., a multimeter.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881414","Counterfeit ICs;Design for Anti-Counterfeit;Recycling;Remarking","Aging;DNA;Frequency measurement;Fuses;Integrated circuits;Inverters;Three-dimensional displays","integrated circuit reliability;negative bias temperature instability;oscillators","AF-CDIR;HSPICE simulation;IC recycling;NBTI-aware RO-CDIR;analog recycled components;anti-fuses CDIR;digital ICs;digital recycled components;negative-bias temperature instability;on-chip structures;ring oscillators;size 90 nm","","2","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, nvSRAM suffers from high dynamic energy usage due to frequent switching between operation modes. In this paper, we propose a redundant store elimination (RSE) scheme which, on average, discards 94% of needless bit-write operations. Moreover, we present a retention-aware cache management policy to reduce data updates of cache blocks, based on the correlation between data lifetime and cache types.

In this paper, we propose a framework to build RO PUF at inverter level, instead of RO level. This provides us the flexibility in choosing whether an inverter should be included in the RO-PUF and hence improve the security and reliability of RO PUF secrecy and reduce its hardware cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the PUF secrecy generated by our configurable RO PUFs is random (by passing the NIST randomness test) and unique from chip to chip.

This is particularly true in the automotive domain, where the code auto-generated from Simulink/Stateflow models is directly flashed onto embedded controllers. Testing based approaches are popular for validating the translation of models to code. However, these approaches cannot guarantee the absence of bugs introduced during translation. We use translation validation as an alternative to testing. By checking the equivalence between a Stateflow model and C code, it can provide formal guarantees about the absence of bugs introduced during translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of translation validation to code generation from hierarchical state-machine modeling languages. Our approach builds upon the significant progress over the last few years in software model-checking: we use a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf software model-checker, CBMC, to make translation validation practical for a complex modeling language like Stateflow. We have applied this approach to Stateflow models from the automotive domain.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881350","C;State flow;Translation validation","Gears;Generators;Inference algorithms;Junctions;Semantics;Software packages;Syntactics","C language;automotive engineering;program compilers;program testing;program verification;visual languages","C code;CBMC;Simulink model;Stateflow model;autogenerated code;automotive domain;bug absence;code generators;complex modeling language;complex software systems;embedded controllers;formal guarantees;hierarchical state-machine modeling languages;model-based development;off-the-shelf software model-checker;testing-based approach;translation validation","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, restricting the design space of steep slope technology-based processors to near-threshold or sub-threshold general purpose processors does the technology a disservice. Steep slope (SS) architectures can simultaneously expand the frontiers of viable computers at both ends of the energy scale: On the one hand, SS architectures enable ultra-low power sensor nodes and wearable technology, while on the other, they are applicable to high powered servers and high performance computing engines. We demonstrate the benefits of adapting this technology in such non-conventional domains, while attempting to address the major challenges encountered.

In those designs, path delays depend exponentially on threshold voltage/temperature. As such, dynamic configurations at runtime are desired for best trade-off between operating power and performance. Unfortunately, most existing works only consider either process or temperature variations but not both, resulting in sub-optimal configurations or even functional failures. Moreover, little study has been performed on the graceful degradation of sub-threshold designs, which is important in the presence of drastic delay variations. Towards this, we present a novel critical path monitor based dynamic voltage scaling scheme. Considering both process and temperature variations, it minimizes the operating power under a given timing error probability (TEP) bound. An exact method to decide the optimal switching thresholds is also proposed. Experimental results on 45nm industrial designs show that with only 1% TEP, our scheme can reduce the operating power by up to 75.3% compared with the constant voltage scheme.

Although researchers claim the effectiveness of the proposed CFC techniques, we argue that their evaluation has been inadequate and can even be wrong! Recently, the metric of vulnerability has been proposed to quantify the susceptibility of computation to soft errors. Laced with this comprehensive metric, we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of several existing CFC schemes, and obtain surprising results. Our results show that existing CFC techniques are not only ineffective in protecting computation from soft errors, but that they incur additional power and performance overheads. Software-only CFC protection schemes (CFCSS [14], CFCSS+NA [2], and CEDA [18]) increase system vulnerability by 18% to 21% with 17% to 38% performance overhead; Hybrid CFC protection technique, CFEDC [4] also increases the vulnerability by 5%; While the vulnerability remains almost the same for hardware only CFC protection technique, CFCET [15], they cause overheads of design cost, area, and power due to the hardware modifications required for their implementations.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881340","","Assembly;Measurement;Pipelines;Program processors;Registers;Runtime","program testing;program verification;radiation hardening (electronics)","CEDA;CFC based techniques;CFCET;CFCSS;CFCSS+NA;CFEDC;area overhead;comprehensive metric;control flow checking mechanisms;control flow checking-based techniques;design cost overhead;hardware-only CFC protection technique;hybrid CFC protection technique;instruction sequence;performance overhead;power overhead;program execution;quantitative analysis;quantitative evaluation;soft error computation susceptibility quantification;software-only CFC protection schemes;vulnerability metric","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Random Number Generators (RNGs) start to appear in recent modern Intel CPUs as used in desktops and servers. Solutions for embedded devices, such as e.g. sensor nodes and wireless routers, are still severely lacking however. In this paper we present the implementation of a secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller family, one of the most popular embedded platforms at this moment. For compactness and compatibility reasons, our implementation is software only. It uses the start-up values of on-chip SRAM as random seed and uses the KECCAK hash function for both entropy extraction as well as pseudo-random number generation. Getting KECCAK very compact in terms of memory requirements is therefore essential. KECCAK is a tunable algorithm: in this paper we discuss the minimum security requirements and the storage costs as a function of the KECCAK variant. The KECCAK permutation of our choice, KECCAK-f[200], is implemented in only 400 bytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest KECCAK implementation published so far. With the addition of initialization, hashing, padding and output generation functions, our complete solution fits within 496 bytes of ROM and requires 52 bytes of RAM. One byte of pseudo-random data, with a security level of at least 128 bits, can be generated in 3337 cyles on an ARM CortexM3/4, i.e. 50 KiB/s on a development board, plenty fast for a cryptographic PRNG in an embedded setting.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881438","Embedded devices;Keccak;Random Number Generation","Cryptography;Entropy;Microcontrollers;NIST;Random access memory;Read only memory","SRAM chips;cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;file organisation;microcontrollers;random number generation;software engineering","ARM Cortex M3-4;ARM Cortex-M microcontroller family;Intel CPU;Keccak hash function;Keccak permutation;Keccak variant;Keccak-based secure PRNG;Keccak-f[200];cryptographic PRNG;cryptographic protocols;embedded devices;entropy extraction;on-chip SRAM;pseudorandom data;pseudorandom number generation;pseudorandom number generator;sensor nodes;storage costs;wireless routers","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a hybrid cooling solution in which TECs are augmented with forced-convection coolers (fans). Precisely, an optimization framework called OFTEC is presented which finds the optimum TEC driving current and the fan speed to minimize the overall power consumption of the cooling system while maintaining safe die temperatures. Simulation results on a set of eight benchmarks show the benefits of the proposed approach. In particular, a baseline system without TECs but with a fan could meet the thermal constraint for only three of the benchmarks whereas the OFTEC solution satisfied thermal constraints for all benchmarks.

The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology.

Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is a mature technology for printing 1D layouts. However, for 20nm and beyond, SADP using a single trim mask becomes insufficient for printing all 1D layouts. A viable solution is to complement SADP with e-beam lithography. In this paper, in order to increase the throughput of printing a 1D layout, we consider the problem of e-beam shot count minimization subject to bounded line end extension constraints. Two different approaches of utilizing the trim mask and e-beam to print a layout are considered. The first approach is under the assumption that the trim mask and e-beam are used for end cutting. The second is under the assumption that the trim mask and e-beam are used to rid of all unnecessary portions. We propose elegant ILP formulations for both approaches. Experimental results show that both ILP formulations can be solved efficiently. The pros and cons of the two approaches for manufacturing 1D layout are discussed.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881378","SADP;e-beam;end cutting;gap removal","Benchmark testing;Layout;Lithography;Metals;Printing;Wires","electron beam lithography;integer programming;linear programming;nanolithography;nanopatterning","1D layout;ILP formulations;SADP;e-beam based manufacturing;e-beam lithography;self-aligned double patterning;single trim mask;throughput optimization;wavelength 20 nm","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose static (SPCS) and dynamic (DPCS) variants of power/capacity scaling, a simple and low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture that utilizes insights gained from our 45nm SOI test chip. Our mechanism combines multi-level voltage scaling with power gating of blocks that become faulty at each voltage level. The SPCS policy sets the runtime cache VDD statically such that almost all of the cache blocks are not faulty. The DPCS policy opportunistically reduces the voltage further to save more power than SPCS while limiting the impact on performance caused by additional faulty blocks. Through an analytical evaluation, we show that our approach can achieve lower static power for all effective cache capacities than a recent complex FTVS work. This is due to significantly lower overheads, despite the failure of our approach to match the min-VDD of the competing work at fixed yield. Through architectural simulations, we find that the average energy saved by SPCS is 55%, while DPCS saves an average of 69% of energy with respect to baseline caches at 1 V. Our approach incurs no more than 4% performance and 5% area penalties in the worst case cache configuration.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881427","","Arrays;Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;SRAM cells","SRAM chips;cache storage;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;silicon-on-insulator","DPCS;FTVS;SOI test chip;SPCS policy;analytical evaluation;architectural simulations;dynamic power-capacity scaling variants;energy savings;fault-tolerant voltage-scalable SRAM cache architectures;low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture;multilevel voltage scaling;power gating;runtime cache VDD;simple fault-tolerant caches;size 45 nm;static power-capacity scaling variants;voltage 1 V;worst case cache configuration","","2","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these and various other application domains, reduction is a frequently encountered operation, where multiple input elements need to be combined into a single element by an associative operation, e.g. addition or multiplication. There are many applications that require reduction such as: partial histogram merging, matrix multiplication and min/max-finding. Wide-SIMDs contain a large number of processing elements (PEs), which in general are connected by a minimal form of interconnect for scalability reasons. To efficiently support reduction operations on wide-SIMDs with such a minimal interconnect, we introduce two novel reduction algorithms which do not rely on complex communication networks or any dedicated hardware. The proposed approaches are compared with both dedicated hardware and other software solutions in terms of performance, area, and energy consumption. A practical case study demonstrates that the proposed software approach has much better generality, flexibility and no additional hardware cost.

This paper presents an asynchronous template that can generate pipelines with low glitch-power consumption under the two-phase bundled-data protocol. Moreover, operations of our pipeline template can be hazard-free by simple techniques. We further analyze the timing constraints of pipelines based on the template, and then introduce two practical extensions of using the template.

"Power-aware NoCs through routing and topology reconfiguration","Parikh, R.; Das, R.; Bertacco, V.","Dept. of Comput.

Today, conventional NoC designs may consume up to 30% of the entire chip's power budget, in large part due to leakage power. In this work, we address this issue by proposing Panthre: our solution deploys power-gating to provide long intervals of uninterrupted sleep to selected units. Packets that would normally use power-gated components are steered away via topology and routing reconfiguration, while Panthre provides low-latency alternate paths to their destinations. The routing reconfiguration operates in a distributed fashion and guarantees that deadlock-free routes are available at all times. At runtime, Panthre adapts to the application's communication patterns by updating its power-gating decisions. It employs a feedback-based distributed mechanism to control the amount of sleeping components and of packets detours, so that performance degradation is kept at a minimum. Our design is flexible, providing a mechanism that designers can use to tradeoff power savings with performance, based on application's requirements. Our experiments on multi-programmed communication-light workloads from the SPEC CPU2006 suite show that Panthre reduces total network power consumption by 14.5% on average, with only a 1.8% degradation in performance, when all processor nodes are active. At times when 15-25% of the processor cores are communication-idle, Panthre enables leakage power savings of 36.9% on average, while still providing connected and deadlock-free routes for all other nodes.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881489","network-on-chip;power-gating;routing-reconfiguration","Engines;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Routing;System recovery;Topology;Wires","circuit feedback;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip","SPEC CPU2006 suite;deadlock-free routing reconfiguration;fabric interconnect;feedback-based distributed mechanism;intrachip communication;multicore processor;multiprogrammed communication-light workload;networks-on-chip;power consumption;power-aware NoC;power-gated component;sleeping component;system-on-chip design;topology reconfiguration","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We quantify the impact of timing violation on key arithmetic primitives, and show that substantial performance benefits can be obtained in comparison to binary arithmetic. Since timing errors are caused by long carry chains, these result in errors in least significant digits with online arithmetic, causing less impact than conventional implementations.

Different battery cells exhibit substantial variability among them due to manufacturing tolerances, which should be carefully assessed and managed. Although battery packs usually incorporate some cell balancing circuitry, it is supposed to balance cell voltages dynamically at the expense of bypassed (not stored) charge. In this paper, we address the issue of how to consider variability when building battery packs based on a recently introduced combined cell-to-cell variation model of the capacity and of the internal resistance of a Li-Ion battery that accounts for variability effects in the cell manufacturing process. We attempt to figure out what kind of pack-level variability should be managed to reduce the cost of the cell balancing. We qualitatively evaluate inter- and intra-column variance minimizing cell placement approaches from the perspective of the passive cell balancing cost while considering the correlation between capacity and internal resistance. The intra-column minimization approach reduce the charging time and bypassed current by differentiating the column currents.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2596689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881462","Battery Modeling;Constant Current - Constant Voltage (CC-CV);Datasheet;Peukert's law","Arrays;Batteries;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Resistance;Solid modeling","battery management systems;secondary cells","battery packs;cell balancing cost reduction;cell manufacturing process;combined cell-to-cell variation model;internal resistance;intra-column minimization approach;lithium-ion battery;pack-level variability;passive cell balancing cost;statistical battery models;variation-aware battery management","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a suite of solutions that enable aging simulation under all possible stress conditions. Key contributions include: (1) Compact modeling of BTI when the stress voltage is varying. The results to both reaction-diffusion (RD) and trapping/detrapping (TD) mechanisms are derived. (2) Efficient simulation under DVS, leveraging the new BTI models; (3) Silicon validation at 45nm and 65nm, at both device and circuit levels. As the results illustrate, it is necessary to combine both RD and TD mechanisms to accurately predict aging under changing stress voltages.

This assumption greatly simplifies the partitioning and balancing of an application's workload across threads; however, it no longer holds when the frequencies of the cores differ due to within-die variations, leading to a degradation in performance. We observe that, in addition to the frequency of the core that it executes on, the performance of a thread is also dependent on the share of shared system resources, such as last-level cache, that it receives. We propose variation-aware cache partitioning as an approach to redress the variation-induced imbalance in the execution times of threads, thereby improving the performance of multi-threaded programs. We discuss the challenges involved in realizing our proposal, including synchronization (e.g., barriers) across threads, which results in faster threads being limited by slower threads, the complex and non-linear relationship between a thread's performance and the cache capacity allocated to it, and the fact that different program phases, can respond quite differently to varying cache capacity. We propose a runtime scheme to perform spatio-temporal cache partitioning while considering both chip characteristics (frequency variations) and program characteristics. We evaluate the proposed technique by applying it to an ensemble of variation-impacted multi-cores executing multi-threaded programs from the PAR-SEC and SPEC-OMP suites, and demonstrate that it results in an average performance improvement of 15% by mitigating the impact of frequency variations.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881526","Multicores;Parallel Programs;Variation Aware Design;Variation Tolerance;Variations","Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Resource management;Runtime;Sensitivity;Synchronization","cache storage;microprocessor chips;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;resource allocation","PAR-SEC;SPEC-OMP;application workload balancing;application workload partitioning;cache capacity;homogeneous multicore processors;last-level cache;multithreaded programs;nonlinear relationship;program phases;shared system resources;spatio-temporal cache partitioning;variation aware cache partitioning;variation-induced imbalance;within-die variations","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, light lockstep is an attractive choice since it does not require redesigning cores but, instead, comparing off-core activities (i.e. data/addresses sent). While this approach suffices to guarantee functional correctness of the system, as needed for certification against safety standards (e.g., ISO26262), it fails to provide any timing guarantee as the time elapsed since the error occurs until lockstep detects it can be inordinately large. In this paper (i) we analyse the timing behaviour of errors in light lockstep systems, showing that a significant fraction of errors may remain undetected for long periods. Then, (ii) we put this problem in the context of certification against safety standards. Finally, (iii) we propose LiVe (Lightly Verbose), an approach to guarantee timely detection of errors at low cost in the context of light lockstep systems.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881352","Automotive;Error detection;Lockstep;Real-time","Automotive engineering;Circuit faults;Hardware;Program processors;Registers;Safety;Timing","certification;embedded systems;error correction codes;error detection codes;fault tolerant computing;safety-critical software","certification;error correction;light lockstep safety-critical system;safety standards;timely error detection;timing behaviour","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we focus on the application and management of battery storage for energy-efficient buildings. We will first introduce a system-level approach to co-schedule the usage of battery storage (in addition to grid electricity) with the control of building HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, to reduce the total building energy cost, including the electricity consumption charge, the peak demand charge, and the battery cost. Then, in a separate formulation, we will introduce another system-level study to reduce the energy cost of EV charging and other fixed building energy load through the usage of battery storage and solar PV. Finally, we will present an ARM processor based programmable embedded battery management system (BMS), which monitors battery status, controls charging and discharging at the circuit level, and provides battery protection. The system also works with off-the-shelf battery management IC (Texas Instrument BMS sensor IC) from industry. Comparing to conventional BMS, this software module based BMS is a more suitable solution for energy efficient buildings due to its high flexibility, scalability, and reusability.

We propose a new technique that enables accurate in-situ aging monitoring even under large environmental variations by (i) scaling the supply voltage for temperature-insensitive delay and (ii) reconfiguring target paths into ring oscillators, whose oscillation periods are measured and compared to pre-aging measurement to estimate aging-induced delay degradations.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of Bayesian model fusion on Bernoulli distribution (BMF-BD) for efficient yield estimation at the late stage by borrowing the prior knowledge from an early stage. BMF-BD is particularly developed to handle the cases where the pre-silicon simulation and/or post-silicon measurement results are binary: either “pass” or “fail”. The key idea is to model the binary simulation/measurement outcome as a Bernoulli distribution and then encode the prior knowledge as a Beta distribution based on the theory of conjugate prior. As such, the late-stage yield can be accurately estimated through Bayesian inference with very few late-stage samples. Several circuit examples demonstrate that BMF-BD achieves up to 10× cost reduction over the conventional estimator without surrendering any accuracy.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881356","","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Integrated circuit modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation;Silicon;Yield estimation","elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;silicon","BMF-BD;Bayesian model fusion;Bernoulli distribution;Beta distribution;integrated circuits yield estimation;post-silicon validation;pre-silicon verification","","2","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the dynamic power is proportional to Vdd<sup>2</sup>, and the static power is proportional to Vdd, lowering power supply voltage is an efficient method to reduce the power usage. In this paper, we adopt the row-based dual-supply voltage (DSV) scheme. DSV assigns a low power supply voltage to timing noncritical gates for the power saving. Contrary to the traditional region-based voltage island works, the row-based approach creates voltage islands along the circuit rows. This kind of fine grid voltage islands give more flexibility on gate voltage assignment such that the low voltage gates can be selected primarily based on timing and design logic, which in turn minimizes the shifter insertion. We present a two-stage flow to generate voltage islands for every two mirrored circuit rows and place gates legally inside each island. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work to cover latch and LCB (local clock buffer) handling and shifter placement in voltage island generation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881452","clustering;dual supply voltage;placement","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Latches;Logic gates;Power demand;Timing","buffer circuits;clocks;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;nanoelectronics","LCB;circuit rows;fine grid voltage islands;gate voltage assignment;local clock buffer;nanometer chip design;power consumption;power saving;row based dual-supply voltage island generation;shifter insertion;shifter placement","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When some memory pages reach their endurance limits, other pages may be far from their limits even when using a perfect wear-leveling. Recent studies have proposed redirection or correction schemes to alleviate this problem, but all suffer from poor throughput or latency.

Security design errors may therefore go undetected until the side-channel leakage is physically measured and evaluated. We show a better solution based on static analysis of C source code. We introduce the new notion of Quantitative Masking Strength (QMS) to estimate the amount of information leakage from software through side channels.

This paper presents a detailed placer that can effectively reduce both half-perimeter wirelength and the peak bin-utilization under the displacement constraint. The proposed lazy-update based incremental density profit function supports efficient cell swapping.

In particular, 3D IC is a good candidate to address the design issues in conventional analog/digital mixed-signal IC designs. In this work, we focus on modeling and analyzing the impacts of through silicon vias (TSVs) on mixed-signal ICs. Based on the analysis, a set of design methodologies for 3D mixed-signal ICs are proposed. The design methodologies are verified with a case study, in which a 12-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is re-designed by partitioning it into three stacked layers for 3D integration. The experimental results show that, compared to the traditional 2D counterpart, our 3D SAR ADC with optimized TSV placement can achieve significant area and power reduction, and performance improvement. Specifically, due to the isolation of substrate noise disturbance in our 3D design, the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) is improved from 68.74 dB to 74.12 dB.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881493","","Abstracts;Couplings;Performance evaluation;Resistance;Silicon;Substrates;Through-silicon vias","analogue-digital conversion;flip-flops;logic partitioning;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC;3D SAR ADC;3D integration technology;3D mixed signal integrated circuits;SAR ADC design case;SNDR;analog mixed-signal IC designs;analog-to-digital converter;digital mixed-signal IC designs;heterogeneous integration;optimized TSV placement;power reduction;signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio;storage capacity 12 bit;substrate noise disturbance;successive approximation register;through silicon vias","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have also quantified the dependencies of aging effects on switching-activity and power-state of workloads. Implementation results show that the processor timing degradation can vary from 2% to 11%, depending on the workload. Due to the dependence of aging on the application workloads, margin based design will be highly pessimistic. We propose an efficient and flexible in situ monitoring methodology, SlackProbe, which inserts timing monitors at both path endpoints and path intermediate nets. We show that SlackProbe reduces the numbers of monitors required by over 15X with ~5% additional delay margin in several commercial processor benchmarks.

The widening latency gap between high speed cores and memory has led to the evolution of multi-level SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchies that exploit the latency benefits of smaller caches (e.g. private L1 and L2 SRAM caches) and the capacity benefits of larger caches (e.g. shared L3 SRAM and shared L4 DRAM cache). The main problem of employing large L3/L4 caches is their high tag lookup latency. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel concept of small and low latency SRAM/DRAM Tag-Cache structures that can quickly determine whether an access to the large L3/L4 caches will be a hit or a miss. The performance of the proposed Tag-Cache architecture depends upon the Tag-Cache hit rate and to improve it we propose a novel Tag-Cache insertion policy and a DRAM row buffer mapping policy that reduce the latency of memory requests. For a 16-core system, this improves the average harmonic mean instruction per cycle throughput of latency sensitive applications by 13.3% compared to state-of-the-art.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881364","","Arrays;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Organizations;Program processors;Radiation detectors;Random access memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;cache storage","DRAM row buffer mapping policy;SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchy;average harmonic mean instruction;high speed cores;high tag lookup latency;multi-core chip;private L1 SRAM caches;private L2 SRAM caches;shared L3 SRAM cache;shared L4 DRAM cache;tag-cache architecture;tag-cache insertion policy;widening latency gap","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we consider the systems with phase-change memory (PCM) as their storage due to its non-volatility and low energy consumption. In order to resolve the problem of the limited storage space and the fact that existing multiversion index designs are lack of space efficiency, we propose a space-efficient multiversion index scheme to enhance the space utilization and access performance of embedded multiversion database systems on PCM by utilizing the byte-addressability and write asymmetry of PCM.

In multithreaded applications, threads cannot run simultaneously. Sampling is commonly used to reduce simulation time, but conventional sampling barely detects the instantaneous program variations of synchronization events and the inconsistency between phases of each core. This work proposes a dynamic adjustment and partial sampling technique (DAPs), consisting of aggressive sampling, lazy sampling, and regular sampling, to overcome thread interference in multithreaded applications. Moreover, DAPs partially selects sampling cores to reduce the overhead of sampling inconsistent phases.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881456","Dynamic adjustment and partial sampling simulation;Multithreaded/Multicore simulation","Frequency modulation;Instruction sets;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Synchronization;Vectors","logic design;microprocessor chips","DAP;aggressive sampling;design space exploration;dynamic adjustment;instantaneous program variations;lazy sampling;multicore chip designs;multicore simulation;multithreaded applications;multithreaded simulation;partial sampling;regular sampling;synchronization events;thread interference","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an efficient QoS implementation for a single-stage, high-radix switch, which is readily scalable to 64 nodes. In addition to best effort and guaranteed throughput services, we implement a guaranteed latency traffic class with a latency bound.

Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM outperforms single level cell (SLC) in terms of capacity while suffering from a weaker cell endurance. Wear leveling strategies are proposed to enhance the endurance but encounters more challenges with the aggravating process variation. Due to endurance variations, balanced write traffic cannot fully exploit the PCM endurance since the weak parts will be worn out sooner than others. In this work, considering process variation, we propose an SLC-enabled wear leveling scheme through dynamic and adaptive mode transformation from MLC to SLC. Instead of redistributing write operations, the proposed scheme dynamically transforms weak and write-dense parts into SLC mode for endurance benefits. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the endurance by 215% with 4% storage overhead while maintaining the capacity advantage of MLC, compared with the most related work.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881363","PCM;endurance;process variation;wear leveling","Educational institutions;Phase change materials;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Resistance;Switches;Transforms","elemental semiconductors;phase change memories;silicon;write-once storage","MLC PCM;SLC-enabled wear leveling;Si;adaptive mode transformation;aggravating process variation;deep silicon regime;dynamic mode transformation;multilevel cell;phase change memory;single level cell;storage overhead;weaker cell endurance;write operations","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, different techniques to increase reliability like hardware-/software-based redundancy or component hardening are applied systematically during Design Space Exploration (DSE), aiming at achieving highest reliability at lowest possible cost. Existing approaches typically solely provide reliability measures, e. g. failure rate or Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF), to the optimization engine, poorly guiding the search which parts of the implementation to change. As a remedy, this work proposes an efficient approach that (a) determines the importance of resources with respect to the system's reliability and (b) employs this knowledge as part of a local search to guide the optimization engine which components/design decisions to investigate. First, we propose a novel approach to derive Importance Measures (IMs) using a structural evaluation of Success Trees (STs). Since ST-based reliability analysis is already used for MTTF calculation, our approach comes at almost no overhead. Second, we enrich the global DSE with a local search. Here, we propose strategies guided by the IMs that directly change and enhance the implemen- tation. In our experimental setup, the available measures to enhance reliability are the selection of hardening levels during resource allocation and software-based redundancy during task binding; exemplarily, the proposed local search considers the selected hardening levels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach regarding optimization quality, particularly in the search for highly-reliable yet affordable implementations - at negligible runtime overhead.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881342","","Embedded systems;Logic gates;Optimization;Redundancy;Reliability engineering;Resource management","redundancy;reliability;resource allocation;software reliability","DSE;ST-based reliability analysis;component hardening;design space exploration;embedded systems;hardware-based redundancy;local search;multiobjective local-search optimization;negligible runtime overhead;optimization engine;reliability importance measurement;resource allocation;software-based redundancy;success trees;system reliability","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the first work that applies the cut process for decomposing odd cycles during routing. For SADP, further, overlay control is a critical issue for yield improvement; while published routers can handle only partial overlay scenarios, our work identifies all the scenarios that induce overlays and proposes a novel constraint graph to model all overlays. With the developed techniques, our router can achieve high-quality routing results with significantly fewer overlays (and thus better yields).

Hardware and software solutions have been deployed to accomplish MBPTA requirements. The latter has achieved the i.i.d. properties running on some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processor designs. Unfortunately, software randomisation challenges functional verification needed for certification since it introduces indirections through pointers in the code.

Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve very significant chip area and power reductions compared with the state of the art.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881492","","Accuracy;Arrays;Capacitance;Capacitors;Layout;Power demand;Routing","capacitors;digital-analogue conversion;integrated circuit layout;logic design","binary-weighted capacitors;capacitor size;capacitor sizing;charge-scaling DAC;charge-scaling digital-to-analog converter;chip area;circuit accuracy;common-centroid capacitor layout generation;common-centroid capacitor placement;parasitic matching;parasitic mismatch;parasitic-aware sizing;power consumption;power reductions","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Equivalence checking of such large custom arithmetic circuits against baseline golden models is beyond the capabilities of contemporary techniques. This paper addresses the problem by deriving word-level canonical polynomial representations from gate-level circuits as Z = F (A) over F<sub>2k</sub>, where Z and A represent the output and input bit-vectors of the circuit, respectively. Using algebraic geometry, we show that the canonical polynomial abstraction can be derived by computing a Gröbner basis of a set of polynomials extracted from the circuit, using a specific elimination (abstraction) term order. By efficiently applying these concepts, we can derive the canonical abstraction in hierarchically designed, custom arithmetic circuits with up to 571-bit datapath, whereas contemporary techniques can verify only up to 163-bit circuits.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881479","Gröbner Bases;Hardware Verification;Word-Level Abstraction","Cryptography;Integrated circuit modeling;Interpolation;Logic gates;Polynomials;Vectors","Galois fields;cryptography;digital arithmetic;multiplying circuits","Galois field arithmetic circuits;Galois fields F2k;arithmetic circuits design;baseline golden models;canonical polynomial abstraction;cryptography;gate-level circuits;word-level abstraction via Gröbner bases;word-level canonical polynomial representations","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as the number of components grows, the total length of flow channels between components must increase exponentially. Recent empirical studies show that long flow channels are vulnerable due to blocking and leakage defects. Thus, it is desirable to minimize the total length of flow channels for robustness. Also, for timing-sensitive biochemical assays, increase in the longest length of flow channel will delay the assay completion time and lead to variation of fluid, thereby affecting the correctness of outcome. The increasing number of components, including the pre-placed components, on the chip makes the flow channel routing problem even more complicated. In this paper, we propose an efficient obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree algorithm to deal with flow channel routing problem in flow-based microfluidic biochips. Based on the concept of Kruskal algorithm and formulating the considerations as a bi-criteria function, our algorithm is capable of simultaneously minimizing the total length and the longest length of flow channel.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881468","Microfluidic biochip;Routing;Steiner tree","Algorithm design and analysis;Bridges;Joining processes;Routing;Steiner trees;TV;Vegetation","lab-on-a-chip;microchannel flow;network routing;trees (mathematics)","Kruskal algorithm;assay completion time delay;bicriteria function;biochemical analysis;flow channel routing problem;flow-based microfluidic biochips;leakage defects;obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree algorithm;timing-sensitive biochemical assays","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Camouflaged logic cells obfuscate a circuit's function by introducing subtle cell design changes at the GDS level. The logic function of a camouflaged logic cell is extremely difficult to determine through silicon imaging analysis preventing netlist extraction, clones and counterfeits. The application of circuit camouflage as part of a customer's design flow can protect hardware IP from reverse engineering. Camouflage fill techniques further inhibit Trojan circuit insertion by completely filling the design with realistic circuitry that does not affect the primary design function. All unused silicon appears to be functional circuitry, so an attacker cannot find space to insert a Trojan circuit. The integration of circuit camouflage techniques is compatible with standard chip design flows and EDA tools, and ICs using such techniques have been successfully employed in high-attack commercial and government segments.

In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881521","Boolean Algebra;DAG;Logic Synthesis;Majority Logic","Boolean functions;Data structures;Delays;Inverters;Optimization;Switches","Boolean functions;data structures;graph theory;logic design;logic gates","AND graph;Boolean function optimization;OR graph;data structure;directed acyclic graph;efficient logic optimization;logic synthesis;majority inverter graph","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, due to the stealthy nature of hardware Trojan, there is no technique that can guarantee Trojan-free after manufacturing test. As a result, Trojan detection and recovery at run time acting as the last line of defense is necessary especially for mission-critical applications.

An associative memristive memory (AMM) module is integrated with the floating point units (FPUs). Together, we enable fine-grained partitioning of values and find high-frequency sets of values for the FPUs by searching the space of possible inputs, with the help of application-specific profile feedback. For every kernel execution, the compiler pre-stores these high-frequent sets of values in AMM modules - representing partial functionality of the associated FPU- that are concurrently evaluated over two clock cycles. Our simulation results show high hit rates with 32-entry AMM modules that enable 36% reduction in average energy use by the kernel codes.

Our experimental results demonstrate scalability for large benchmarks and that the amount of available parallelism depends primarily on the circuit size, not the inter-dependence of signals.

However, this trend significantly reduces the reliability and endurance of flash memory chips. The lifetime degradation worsens as the number of erase cycles grows, even with wear leveling technology being adopted to extend flash memory lifetime by evenly distributing erase cycles to every flash block. To address this issue, self-healing technology is proposed to recover a flash block before the flash block is worn out, but such a technology still has its limitation when recovering flash blocks. In contrast to the existing wear leveling designs, we adopt the self-healing technology to propose a heal-leveling design that evenly distributes healing cycles to flash blocks. Ultimately, heal-leveling aims to extend the lifetime of flash memory without introducing a large amount of live-data copying overheads. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the capability of the proposed design. The results show that our design can significantly improve the access performance and the effective lifetime of flash memory without the unnecessary overheads caused by wear leveling technology.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881410","endurance;flash memory;reliability;self-healing;wear leveling","Ash;Heating;Process control;Reliability;Safety;Servers;Thigh","fault tolerant computing;flash memories;performance evaluation","access performance improvement;flash block recovery;flash memory chip endurance;flash memory chip reliability;flash memory density;flash memory lifetime degradation;heal-leveling design;live-data copying overheads;self-healing technology;storage capacity;trading wear-leveling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that it enables the extraction of an entire set of MOSFET model parameters using limited and incomplete IV measurements from on-chip monitor circuits. An important step in this method is the use of maximum-a-posteriori estimation where past measurements of transistors from various technologies are used to learn a prior distribution and its uncertainty matrix for the parameters of the target technology. The framework then utilizes Bayesian inference to facilitate extraction using a very small set of additional measurements. The proposed method is validated using various past technologies and post-silicon measurements for a commercial 28-nm process. The proposed extraction could also be used to characterize the statistical variations of MOSFETs with the significant benefit that some constraints required by the backward propagation of variance (BPV) method are relaxed.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881357","Bayesian inference;MIT Virtual Source (MVS) MOSFET model;maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation;parameter extraction","Current measurement;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Parameter extraction;Semiconductor device modeling;Transistors;Uncertainty","MOSFET;elemental semiconductors;maximum likelihood estimation;semiconductor device measurement;semiconductor device models;silicon","Bayesian inference;IV measurements;MOSFET;Si;maximum-a-posteriori estimation;on-chip monitor circuits;parameter extraction;post-silicon measurements;size 28 nm;target technology;transistors;variance backward propagation","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing power budgeting techniques focus on maximizing performance under a given power budget by optimizing the core dynamics. However, in multi-core era, a chip-wide power budget is not sufficient to ensure thermal constraints because the thermal sustainable power capacity varies with different threading strategies and core configurations. In this paper, we propose a model which estimates the thermal sustainable power capacity considering these two run-time factors. The model converts the thermal effect of threading strategies and core configurations into power capacity, which provides a context-based power budget for the power budgeting. Based on this model, we introduce a power budgeting framework aiming to optimize the performance within thermal constraints, named as TSocket. Compared to the chip-wide power budgeting solution, TSocket shows 19% of performance improvement for the PARSEC benchmarks by reducing thermal violations and providing extra power budget for performance improvement.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881514","","Estimation;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Semiconductor device measurement;Temperature measurement;Thermal management","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;thermal management (packaging)","PARSEC benchmarks;TSocket;context-based power budget;core dynamics;dynamic threading;higher integration density;multi-core architectures;power density;thermal effect;thermal management;thermal sustainable power capacity;thermal violations;thermal-sustainable power budgeting","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior work has also shown that attackers can manipulate voltage supply and temperature to bias the TRNG output.

We propose sneak-path encryption (SPE), for memristor-based NVMM. SPE exploits the physical parameters, multi-level cell (MLC) capability and the sneak paths in cross-bar memories to encrypt the data stored in memristor-based NVMM. We investigate three attacks on NVMMs and show the resilience of SPE against them. We use a cycle accurate simulator to evaluate the security and performance impact of SPE based NVMM. SPE can secure the NVMM with a latency of 16 cycles and ~1.5% performance overhead.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881505","","Ciphers;Encryption;Memristors;Nonvolatile memory;Resistance","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;cryptography;memristors;phase change memories","DRAM main memories;MLC;SPE;SRAM main memories;cross-bar memories;memristor-based NVMM;memristor-based main memory;multilevel cell;nonvolatile main memories;nonvolatile memory devices;phase change memories;sneak-path encryption","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, LDPC incurs read performance overhead because of its complex decoding procedure. To mitigate such overhead, we propose the error-correcting cache (EC-Cache) that exploits the “error locality” of NAND flash. Error locality means that the majority of errors in reads to the same NAND flash page appear in the same positions until the page is erased. By caching detected errors, EC-Cache can correct a significant portion of errors present in a requested flash page before the associated LDPC decoding process begins. EC-Cache can greatly speed up LDPC decoding because LDPC's latency is directly correlated to the number of errors present in the input data. Experimental results show that EC-Cache achieves up to 2.6× SSD read performance gain.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881472","LDPC;NAND flash;SSD;bit errors;cache","Bit error rate;Decoding;Encoding;Flash memories;Iterative decoding;Sensors","NAND circuits;cache storage;decoding;error correction codes;flash memories;parity check codes","EC-cache;LDPC decoding process;LDPC latency;NAND flash page;NAND flash-based SSD;baseline error-correction codes;decoding procedure;error locality;error-correcting cache;error-correcting capability;low-density parity-check","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, EDA algorithms at this level have to support exposing technology characteristics (such as process variations or aging) for consideration on higher levels of abstraction. Similarly, key parameters from system level, such as workload or executed processor instructions, have to be considered at lower levels for accurate analysis of, e.g., degradation effects. Circuit-level timing analysis plays a key role in this context as it provides key metrics such as achievable frequency, available timing margins and timing violation vulnerabilities of the analyzed circuit.

In this work, we develop a holistic solution set, namely, state-restrict MLC STT-RAM (SR-MLC STT-RAM) to improve the data integrity and performance of MLC STT-RAM with the minimized information density degradation. Three techniques: state restriction (StatRes), error pattern removal (ErrPR), and ternary coding (TerCode) are proposed at circuit level to reduce the read and write errors of MLC STT-RAMcells. State pre-recovery (PreREC) technique is also developed at architecture level to improve the access performance of SR-MLC STT-RAM by eliminating unnecessary two-step write operations. Our simulations show that compared to conventional MLC STT-RAM, SR-MLC STT-RAM can enhance the write and read reliability of memory cells by 10 - 10000×, allowing the application of simple error correction code schemes.

Two specific exemplars are used to illustrate multi-layer memory resilience: first we describe static and dynamic policies to achieve energy savings in caches using aggressive voltage scaling combined with disabling faulty blocks; and second we show how software characteristics can be exposed to the architecture in order to mitigate the aging of large register files in GPGPUs. These approaches can further benefit from semantic retention of application intent to enhance memory dependability across multiple abstraction levels, including applications, compilers, run-time systems, and hardware platforms.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2596684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881375","","Circuit faults;Hardware;Memory management;Random access memory;Reliability;Resilience;Software","cache storage;energy conservation;graphics processing units;hardware-software codesign;power aware computing","GPGPU;abstraction levels;cache;dynamic policy;energy savings;failure modes;faulty blocks;high-performance memory bandwidth;memory degradation;memory dependability;memory hierarchy;multilayer hardware-software approach;multilayer memory resiliency;operational stress;software characteristics;static policy;variability stress;voltage scaling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evaluations of such methods using benchmarks and academically known attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test the abilities of the FANCI prototype. In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups from multiple continents created designs with backdoors hidden in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are non-stealthy backdoors, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some areas where the FANCI prototype could be made more performant, which motivates further development of the prototype.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881502","backdoors;functional analysis;hardware;intellectual property;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Logic gates;Prototypes;Security;Testing;Wires","functional analysis;logic design","FANCI;blue team assessment;dynamic attack scenarios;frequent-action backdoors;functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification;functional analysis methods;hardware designs;malicious circuit identification;non-stealthy backdoors;red team assessment","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While some communication traffic requires immediate resource allocations (such as voice services), an increasing number of mobile phone applications produce a lot of background communication traffic (e.g. social network apps, crowd sensing services). In this paper we discuss the predictive Channel-Aware Transmission (pCAT) scheme, which leverages the fact, that favorable channel conditions require much less spectrum resource allocation than bad channel conditions. By leveraging the knowledge of user trajectories and recurring spots with favorable channel conditions, the so-called LTE connectivity hot spots, background traffic transmissions can be scheduled by the client according to expected channel quality and application data priority. Thereby, the spectrum consumption of background traffic of applications can be reduced significantly. At the same time, the efficient usage of spectrum resources has also an impact on the battery lifetime of the mobile devices. By introducing the Context-Aware Power Consumption Model (CoPoMo) for LTE communications, we highlight, how decisions about the spectrum resource allocation by the network will impact the battery lifetime. One case study will show, that by simply changing the resource allocation scheme and without the need for spending more spectrum resources, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 70% using the Energy-Efficient Scheduling (EES) introduced in this paper.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2596686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881396","Channel-Aware Transmission;CoPoMo;Energy efficiency;Mobile Crowd Sensing;Resource-efficient Communication","Batteries;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Resource management;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Trajectory","Long Term Evolution;mobile communication;quality of experience;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","CoPoMo;EES;LTE communications;LTE connectivity hot spots;application data priority;background traffic transmissions;bad channel conditions;battery lifetime;channel quality;communication traffic;context-aware power consumption model;crowd-sensing;energy-efficient scheduling;mobile communications;mobile phone applications;pCAT scheme;predictive channel-aware transmission scheme;quality of experience;resource allocations;resource-efficient communication;spectrum resource allocation","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recycling of used chips constitutes a major form of counterfeiting attacks. If undetected, they can lead to serious consequences including system performance/reliability issues during field operation and potential revenue/reputation loss for a trusted manufacturer. Existing validation approaches based on path delay analysis suffer from reduced robustness and sensitivity under large process variations. On the other hand, existing design solutions based on aging sensors require additional design/verification efforts and cannot be applied to legacy chips. In this paper, we present a novel recycled chip identification approach, CACI, that exploits differential aging in self-similar modules (e.g., different parts of an adder) to isolate aged chips under large inter- and intra-die process variations. It compares dynamic current (I<sub>DDT</sub>) signatures between two adjacent similar circuit structures in a chip. We derive an isolation metric based on multiple current comparisons to provide high level of confidence. CACI does not rely on any embedded structures for authentication, thus it comes at virtually zero design overhead and can be applied to chips already in the market. Through extensive simulations, we show that for 15% inter- and 10% intra-die variations in threshold voltage for a 45nm CMOS process, over 97% of recycled chips can be reliably identified.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881415","BTI;Counterfeiting attack;Hardware security;Recycled chip","Accuracy;Adders;Aging;Integrated circuits;Semiconductor device measurement;Vectors","CMOS integrated circuits;ageing;integrated circuit design;recycling;security","CACI;CMOS;adder;aging sensors;differential aging;dynamic current analysis;inter-die process variations;intra-die process variations;path delay analysis;recycled chip identification;semiconductor industry;size 45 nm","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Formal verification (FV) has been successfully leveraged to achieve the high level of quality desired of these critical logics. Typically, FV-based approaches to verify FPUs rely on introducing higher level abstractions to allow reasoning. This however has to be done manually, and quickly becomes tedious for optimized bit level implementations on board high performance microprocessors. Automated formal methods working directly on the bit level and providing a full end-to-end check exist but are limited to single instructions (issued in an empty pipeline), hence lack in checking control aspects related to inter-instruction interactions, or pipeline control. In this paper we present an approach based on equivalence checking to overcome the single instruction limitation for automated bit level proofs in the formal verification of FPUs. The sequential execution of instructions is modeled by two instances of the design-under-test. One of the instances acts as a reference model for the other. This allows for large numbers of internal equivalences to be leveraged by equivalence checking techniques. We show that this method is capable of proving instruction sequences for industrial FPU designs. Together with a proof of correctness of individual instructions it guarantees correctness of the FPU design as a whole. In our experience this is a one of a kind approach to perform automated end-to-end verification of FPUs.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881478","","Abstracts;Pipelines;Servers;Vehicles","floating point arithmetic;formal verification;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","automated bit level proofs;automated end-to-end FPU verification;automated formal methods;automatic floating point unit verification;coverage driven simulation;critical logics;design-under-test;equivalence checking techniques;formal FPU verification;high performance microprocessors;industrial FPU designs;interinstruction interactions;pipeline control","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering that wide design space, it's clear that EDA industry that is focusing on generic applicable tools leaves a wide field for automation unsupported. This paper presents a novel approach to system synthesis named Metasynthesis. It proposes a new highly flexible methodology based on synthesizing system synthesis tools. These synthesized tools finally make the synthesis step from a description above implementation level, e.g. requirements, specification, or a domain specific description to implementation level, e.g. C, SystemVerilog-RTL or schematic. The name “Meta”-Synthesis was chosen in the sense of a synthesis tool “beyond” another synthesis tool or as already said a synthesis tool synthesizing another synthesis tool. The term “Meta” also reflects the underlying metamodeling technique. Even if the approach requires additional effort in building the system synthesis tool, it helps to shorten overall design time, since building the tool is highly automated due to the presented Metasynthesis approach. Also the input views are fast to make since they can be kept simple and compact. The Metasynthesis approach was proven so far in over 90 different automotive SoC and other applications gaining productivity improvements of 95% considering single design steps and gaining up to 70% effort reduction for the complete implementation of automotive SoCs. Some designers report, that they generate up to 80% of the chip's overall RTL code with synthesized tools.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881398","code generation;design productivity;metamodeling;metasynthesis;system level synthesis","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Biological system modeling;Buildings;Libraries;Metamodeling;System-on-chip","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","Metasynthesis;automotive SoC design;metamodeling technique;system synthesis tool","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present the GUARD method which allows for autonomous runtime reliability management in reconfigurable architectures: Based on the error rate observed during runtime, the runtime system dynamically determines whether a computation should be executed by a hardened processor, or whether it should be accelerated by inherently less reliable reconfigurable hardware which can trade-off performance and reliability. GUARD is the first runtime system for reconfigurable architectures that guarantees a target reliability while optimizing the performance. This allows applications to dynamically chose the desired degree of reliability. Compared to related work with statically optimized fault tolerance techniques, GUARD provides up to 68.3% higher performance at the same target reliability.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881359","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Containers;Error analysis;Hardware;Reliability;Runtime","SRAM chips;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;optimisation;radiation hardening (electronics);reconfigurable architectures","GUARD method;SRAM-based FPGA;autonomous runtime reliability management;fault tolerance techniques;guaranteed reliability;hardened processor;modular redundancy;reconfigurable architectures;reconfigurable systems;runtime system;soft error rate at runtime","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, power failure may occur at any time and result in loss of important data. Crash recovery therefore becomes vitally important in NAND flash memory storage systems. As flash translation layer (FTL) directly manages flash memory using various metadata, the problem of FTL crash recovery in NAND flash is how to efficiently and effectively maintain and recover the consistency of FTL metadata after system crash. In this paper, we present DCR, a deterministic approach to crash recovery for NAND flash based storage systems. The basic idea is to exploit the determinism of FTL and reproduce events that happened between the last checkpoint and the crash point during crash recovery. Different from existing approaches which have to scan the whole flash memory chip, we show that DCR can recover the system more efficiently by only checking a limited number of blocks based on deterministic FTL operations. We have implemented DCR for a block-level FTL and compared it with a popular version-based scheme using an ARM11-based embedded evaluation board. Experimental results show that DCR can greatly reduce recovery time and guarantee the consistency of FTL metadata after recovery.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881475","NAND flash memory;crash recovery;reliability","Ash;Benchmark testing;Computer crashes;Flash memories;Random access memory;Resource management;Virtual private networks","NAND circuits;flash memories","ARM11-based embedded evaluation board;FTL crash recovery;FTL metadata;NAND flash based storage systems;NAND flash memory;block-level FTL;deterministic crash recovery;flash memory chip;flash translation layer","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive thermal management approach to improve the lifetime reliability of multicore systems by considering both inter- and intra-application thermal variations. Fundamental to this approach is a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns the relationship between the mapping of threads to cores, the frequency of a core and its temperature (sampled from on-board thermal sensors). Action is provided by overriding the operating system's mapping decisions using affinity masks and dynamically changing CPU frequency using in-kernel governors. Lifetime improvement is achieved by controlling not only the peak and average temperatures but also thermal cycling, which is an emerging wear-out concern in modern systems. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using an Intel quad-core platform executing a diverse set of multimedia benchmarks. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach minimizes average temperature, peak temperature and thermal cycling, improving the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by an average of 2× for intra-application and 3× for inter-application scenarios when compared to existing thermal management techniques. Furthermore, the dynamic and static energy consumption are also reduced by an average 10% and 11% respectively.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881497","","Legged locomotion;Linux;Reliability;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit reliability;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;thermal management (packaging)","CPU frequency;adaptive thermal management;affinity masks;average temperature minimization;in-kernel governor;interapplication thermal optimization;intraapplication thermal optimization;lifetime reliability;mean-time-to-failure improvement;multicore system lifetime improvement;multimedia benchmark;peak temperature minimization;reinforcement learning;thermal cycling minimization;thermal profile","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works have proposed the enforcement of control-flow integrity (CFI) as a general defense against runtime attacks. However, existing solutions either suffer from performance overhead or only enforce coarse-grain CFI policies that a sophisticated adversary can undermine. In this paper, we tackle these limitations and present the design of novel security hardware mechanisms to enable fine-grained CFI checks. Our CFI proposal is based on a state model and a per-function CFI label approach. In particular, our CFI policies ensure that function returns can only transfer control to active call sides (i.e, return landing pads of functions currently executing). Further, we restrict indirect calls to target the beginning of a function, and lastly, deploy behavioral heuristics for indirect jumps.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881460","","Embedded systems;Hardware;Payloads;Radiation detectors;Runtime;Security","embedded systems;security of data","CFI;CFI label approach;CFI policy;ROP attacks;behavioral heuristics;code injection attacks;embedded system protection;hardware-assisted fine-grained control-flow integrity;runtime attacks;security hardware mechanisms;software exploitation","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, compared to logic slices, DSP blocks are scarce resources, hence its usage needs to be optimized. The asymmetric 25 × 18 signed multipliers in FPGAs open a new paradigm for multiplier design, where operand decomposition becomes equivalent to a tiling problem. Previous literature has reported that for asymmetric multiplier, it is possible to generate a tiling (known as non-standard tiling) which requires less number of DSP blocks compared to standard tiling, generated by school book algorithm. In this paper, we propose a generic technique for such tiling generation and generate this tiling for field multiplication in NIST specified curves. We compare our technique with standard school book algorithm to highlight the improvement. The acceleration in ECC scalar multiplication due to the optimized field multiplier is experimentally validated for P-256. The impact of this accelerated scalar multiplication is shown for the key encapsulation algorithm PSEC-KEM (Provably Secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism).","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881504","DSP Blocks;ECC;FPGA;NIST Curves","Clocks;Digital signal processing;Educational institutions;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Field programmable gate arrays;Standards","digital signal processing chips;encapsulation;field programmable gate arrays;multiplying circuits;public key cryptography","DSP multiplier;ECC scalar multiplication;FPGA;NIST curves;P-256;asymmetric multiplier;elliptic curve scalar multiplication;key encapsulation algorithm PSEC-KEM;multiplier design;operand decomposition;prime field multiplication;provably secure key encapsulation mechanism;school book algorithm;tiling generation;tiling problem","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mathematically, LDA-FP is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem that can be efficiently solved by a novel branch-and-bound method proposed in this paper. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that LDA-FP substantially outperforms the conventional approach for the emerging biomedical application of brain computer interface.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881394","","Classification algorithms;Cost function;Fixed-point arithmetic;Support vector machine classification;Upper bound;Vectors","CAD;fixed point arithmetic;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;tree searching","LDA-FP algorithm;biomedical application;brain computer interface;branch-and-bound method;computer-aided design;fixed-point classifier training;linear discriminant analysis algorithm;low-power fixed-point arithmetic;machine learning algorithm;mixed integer programming problem;word length","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high-throughput computation raises a high data demand. To prevent data accesses from being the bottleneck, on-chip memories are used as data reuse buffers to reduce off-chip accesses. Also memory partitioning is explored to increase the memory bandwidth by scheduling multiple simultaneous memory accesses to different memory banks. Prior work on memory partitioning of data reuse buffers is limited to uniform partitioning. In this paper, we perform an early-stage exploration of non-uniform memory partitioning. We use the stencil computation, a popular communication-intensive application domain, as a case study to show the potential benefits of non-uniform memory partitioning. Our novel method can always achieve the minimum memory size and the minimum number of memory banks, which cannot be guaranteed in any prior work. We develop a generalized microarchitecture to decouple stencil accesses from computation, and an automated design flow to integrate our microarchitecture with the HLS-generated computation kernel for a complete accelerator.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881404","","Arrays;Clocks;Kernel;Microarchitecture;Ports (Computers);Radiation detectors;System-on-chip","high level synthesis;integrated memory circuits;logic partitioning","HLS tools;HLS-generated computation kernel;communication-intensive application domain;data access;data reuse buffers;high-level descriptions;high-level synthesis tools;highly pipelined register-transfer level specifications;memory access;memory bandwidth;memory banks;nonuniform memory partitioning;off-chip access;on-chip memories;optimal microarchitecture;stencil computation acceleration","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An increase in the voltage drop above the threshold level, caused by EM-induced increase in resistances of the individual interconnect segments, is considered as a failure criterion. It replaces a currently employed conservative weakest segment criterion, which does not account an essential redundancy for current propagation existing in the power-ground (p/g) networks. EM-induced increase in the resistance of the individual grid segments is described in the approximation of the recently developed physics-based formalism for void nucleation and growth. A statistical approach to calculation of the void nucleation times in the group of branches comprising the interconnect tree is implemented. As a result, p/g networks become time-varying linear networks. A developed technique for calculating the hydrostatic stress evolution inside a multi-branch interconnect tree allows to avoid over optimistic prediction of the time-to-failure (TTF) made with the Blech-Black analysis of individual branches of interconnect tree. Experimental results obtained on a number of IBM benchmark circuits validate the proposed methodology.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881407","MTTF;electromigration;hydrostatic stress;power grid","Current density;Mathematical model;Metals;Power grids;Resistance;Stress;Wires","VLSI;electric potential;electromigration;fault trees;integrated circuit reliability;linear network analysis;power grids;power integrated circuits;redundancy;time-varying networks","Blech-Black analysis;IBM benchmark circuits;TTF;VLSI systems;failure criterion;grid segment;hydrostatic stress evolution;multibranch interconnect tree;p/g networks;physics-based electromigration assessment;power delivery network;power grid network;power-ground network;redundancy;statistical approach;time-to-failure;time-varying linear network;void nucleation;voltage drop","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, it highlights first the unsustainable energy cost incurred by the straightforward wireless streaming of raw data to external analysis servers. Then, it introduces the need for new cross-layered design methods (beyond hardware and software boundaries) to enhance the autonomy of WBSNs for ambulatory monitoring. In fact, by embedding more onboard intelligence and exploiting electrocardiogram (ECG) specific knowledge, it is possible to perform real-time compressive sensing, filtering, delineation and classification of heartbeats, while dramatically extending the battery lifetime of cardiac monitoring systems. The paper concludes by showing the results of this new approach to design ultra-low power wearable WBSNs in a real-life platform commercialized by SmartCardia. This wearable system allows a wide range of applications, including multi-lead ECG arrhythmia detection and autonomous sleep monitoring for critical scenarios, such as monitoring of the sleep state of airline pilots.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881344","Bio-Medical Signal Processing;Wearable Embedded Systems;Wireless Body Sensor Nodes","Biomedical monitoring;Computer architecture;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical electronics;body sensor networks;compressed sensing;electrocardiography;low-power electronics;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;signal classification","ECG specific knowledge;SmartCardia;WBSN autonomy;ambulatory monitoring;battery lifetime;cross layered design methods;electrocardiogram;heartbeat classification;heartbeat delineation;medical devices;onboard intelligence embedding;real time cardiac monitoring;real time compressive sensing;signal filtering;system level architecture;ultralow power WBSN;ultralow power design;wearable cardiac monitoring systems;wireless body sensor nodes;wireless data streaming","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the floorplan of dies on the interposer and the signal assignment for macro-bumps and TSVs will largely impact the wirelength of the interconnects in a 2.5D IC. Because long interconnects would degrade the performance of 2.5D ICs, the multi-die floorplanning problem and signal assignment problem for 2.5D ICs are critical. This paper presents an enumeration-based algorithm and a network-flow-based algorithm to solve the multi-die floorplanning and signal assignment problems in a 2.5D IC, respectively. Also, to speed up the floorplanning and signal assignment algorithms, several acceleration techniques are proposed. The experimental results reveal that this work can effectively reduce the total wirelength in a 2.5D IC and the acceleration techniques can significantly speed up the proposed algorithms.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881332","","Acceleration;Benchmark testing;Runtime;Silicon;Three-dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;silicon;three-dimensional integrated circuits","2.5D IC interconnects;3D ICs;TSVs;acceleration techniques;enumeration-based algorithm;macro-bumps;multi-die floorplanning problem;network-flow-based algorithm;signal assignment algorithms;silicon interposer","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from previous research that focused on the properties of single module under a limited number of usage scenarios, our works are performed on the statistically selected representative Apps with four generations of Samsung Galaxy series smartphones. We found that over the four characterized generations, the average power consumption of the smartphones with a connected Wi-Fi network on the selected Apps increases about 38.20%, indicating more and more energy-hungry designs. However, the raising of the power consumption is not mainly from the radio modules as the power efficiency of the Wi-Fi module indeed improves by about 21%. The 4G module consumes about 15.13% more power compared to the latest 3G module. But the power efficiency of 3G module improves by averagely 15.17% over the four generations. The GPS module also shows 25.80% power consumption improvement over the generations. We also show that the characterized power results can be combined with the real user traces for detailed daily energy usage estimation.

Once such errors occur in the configuration frames of an FPGA device, they permanently affect the functionality of the mapped design. The combination of error correction schemes and configuration scrubbing is an efficient approach to avoid such permanent errors. Existing solutions exploit coding techniques with considerably high overhead to protect configuration frames against multiple bit upsets. In this paper, we propose a generic scrubbing scheme which reconstructs the erroneous configuration frame based on the concept of erasure codes. Our proposed scheme does not require any changes to the FPGA architecture. Experimental results on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA device show that the proposed scheme achieves error recovery coverage of 99.30% with only 3% resource occupation while the mean time to repair is comparable with previous schemes.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881539","","Decoding;Encoding;Error correction;Error correction codes;Field programmable gate arrays;Performance evaluation;Random access memory","SRAM chips;error correction codes;field programmable gate arrays;radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM-based FPGAs;Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA device;coding techniques;erasure codes;erroneous configuration frame;error correction schemes;error recovery;generic scrubbing scheme;multiple bit upsets;nanoscale technology nodes;radiation-induced soft errors","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
