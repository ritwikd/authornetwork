Challenges faced in the microelectronic area include growing system complexity, higher operating speed, denser design at all levels of integration (chip, printed circuit board, MCM and system). Growing complexity, denser design and higher speed all lead to a substantial increase in EMC problems and design time. EMC is not commonly accepted in microelectronic design. Microelectronic designers have the opinion that EMC has to do with electrical and electronic systems and mandatory product regulations instead of requirements to the integrated circuit they are designing, In this contribution a concept for an EMC-adequate design of electronic systems will be introduced. This concept is based on a generalized development process to integrate EMC-constraints into system design. A prototype of an environment to analyse signal integrity effects on PCB based on a workflow oriented integration approach will be introduced. Based on this approach the generation of user specific design and analysis environments including various set of EMC-tools is possible,","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600122","","Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic interference;Electromagnetic radiation;Electrostatic discharge;Electrostatic interference;Microelectronics;Printed circuits;System analysis and design;Systems engineering and theory;Time to market","circuit CAD;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference;printed circuit design","EMC-adequate design;PCB;development process;electromagnetic interference;microelectronic area;operating speed;printed circuit boards;signal integrity;system complexity;system development;user specific design;workflow oriented integration","","0","","11","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to known approaches, which use only topological information, the presented method also exploits specific information about design modules and higher-level design structure. Based on this knowledge, the design-driven procedure creates a cluster structure that incorporates the inherent design relationships (e.g. signal flow, logic blocks) in the best way possible. Followed by standard iterative improvement algorithms, partitions are produced that outperform many partitioning approaches published before. Because of its linear time complexity, the presented clustering strategy is able to handle very large designs. Due to its modular structure, it can be easily extended to incorporate special design features or target architectures such as emulation systems","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600057","","Clustering algorithms;Digital integrated circuits;Emulation;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Logic design;Partitioning algorithms;Signal design;Standards publication;Very large scale integration","VLSI;computational complexity;integrated logic circuits;logic partitioning","VLSI digital integrated circuits;cluster structure;clustering strategy;design features;design modules;design-driven partitioning;emulation systems;higher-level design structure;inherent design relationships;iterative improvement algorithms;linear time complexity;logic blocks;modular structure;signal flow;target architectures;topological information","","0","","34","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the ASP-DAC '97 Asia and South Pacific","20020806","1997","","","9","18","This paper proposes two methods for a rapid prototyping of top-down system-on-chip (SOC) design using laser programmable gate arrays (LPGAs). The first one is a design flow of SOC consisting of four steps: concept-making, virtual-world prototyping, synthesis, and real-world prototyping. The steps can be undertaken individually or in tandem and provisional product models are transformed from upper stream (concept-making) to lower stream (synthesis) either automatically or semi-automatically. This method differs from ordinary rapid prototyping methods in that design evaluation is shifted more upper stream. The SOC device is manufactured early; the steps follow concept-making, virtual-world prototyping, synthesis and real-world prototyping (in the ordinary case, from real-world prototyping to synthesis). This method allows the device to be evaluated in the actual operating environment. The second method we propose is based on LPGAs and use of a real-time production fabrication system (RPFS). With these design methods and environment, we can get a shortest time to market which offers exciting audio and video capabilities while giving designers the flexibility they need to rapidly produce innovative and creative products. This paper describes the application of these methods to develop video signal processors for LCD projectors, demonstrating their efficiency for design tuning and performance optimization","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600051","","Design methodology;Laser modes;Manufacturing;Optical arrays;Optical design;Production systems;Prototypes;Real time systems;System-on-a-chip;Virtual prototyping","CAD/CAM;circuit optimisation;digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;logic CAD;real-time systems;video signal processing","FPGA;LCD projectors;LPGA;audio;circuit synthesis;concept-making;design flow;design tuning;innovative products;laser programmable gate arrays;performance optimization;rapid prototyping;real-time production fabrication system;real-world prototyping;system-on-chip devices;time to market;top-down design;video;video signal processors;virtual-world prototyping","","2","2","11","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis shows that the timing jitter of the PLL system depends on the jitter in the ring oscillator and an accumulation factor which is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the PLL. Further analysis shows that the timing jitter of the PLL system, however, proportionally depends on the bandwidth of tile PLL when an external jitter source is applied. The analysis of the PLL timing jitter of both cases gives the clue to the optimal bandwidth design for low noise PLL applications. Simulation results using a C-language PLL model are compared with the theoretical predictions and show good agreement","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600281","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Clocks;Data mining;Noise reduction;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Timing jitter;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Working environment noise","circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;phase locked loops","PLL timing jitter;charge-pump PLLs;discrete-time model;low noise PLL;optimal bandwidth design;phase-locked loop;ring oscillator VCOs","","2","","7","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the absence of a system-level estimation and analysis tool, system partitioning is difficult to perform in an efficient and accurate manner because design evaluation can only be done after the final results are achieved. Furthermore, without cost-performance tradeoff information relating to different design alternatives, the designer can not make intelligent design decisions at the early system-level partitioning stages. In this paper, we present a system-level cost/performance evaluation approach which systematically explores the AT (Area-Time) design-space from a system description. This allows the designer to obtain first-hand design tradeoff information before the partitioning process has taken place. We have also developed a system-level interactive design evaluation system on top of the proposed approach. Experiments on a number of examples demonstrate that our approach provides the designer with a comprehensive system-level design evaluation method to effectively explore all possible design, alternatives in the early stages of system development","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600128","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Information management;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;System-level design","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;logic CAD;logic partitioning","area-time design-space;cost-performance tradeoff;cost-performance tradeoffs;design evaluation;interactive design evaluation;system partitioning","","0","","17","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

C models are co-simulated with consistency checking between two different models. The simulation speed of C models makes it possible to test the “real-world” application programs on the RTL design with a software board model. To increase the confidence level of verifications, Profiler reports the verification coverage of the test vector, which is fed back to the automatic test program generator.

The number of execution steps is estimated by a combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis. It enables fast and precise estimation of actual performance in the early design stage.

While the aforementioned types of DDs are suitable for representing Boolean functions at the bit-level and have proved useful for a lot of applications in CAD, recently DDs to represent integer-valued functions, like MTBDDs (=ADDs), EVBDDs, FEVBDDs, (*)BMDs, HDDs (=KBMDs), and K*BMDs, attract more and more interest, e.g., using *BMDs it was for the first time possible to verify multipliers of bit length up to n=256. In this paper we clarify the representational power of these DD classes. Several (inclusion) relations and (exponential) gaps between specific classes differing in the availability of additive and/or multiplicative edge weights and in the choice of decomposition types are shown. It turns out for example, that K(*)BMDs, a generalization of OKFDDs to the word-level, also “include” OBDDs, MTBDDs and (*)BMDs. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that a restriction of the K(*)BMD concept to subclasses, such as OBDDs, MTBDDs, (*)BMDs as well, results in families of functions which lose their efficient representation","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600304","","Application software;Boolean functions;Computer science;Data structures;Design automation;Research and development","Boolean algebra;decision tables;logic CAD","ADDs;BMDs;Computer Aided Design;EVBDDs;FEVBDDs;HDDs;K*BMDs;KBMDs;MTBDDs;bit-level;decision diagrams;decomposition types;integer-valued functions;word-level","","13","","21","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eng., Waseda Univ., Tokyo, Japan","Design Automation Conference, 1997. Proceedings of the ASP-DAC '97 Asia and South Pacific","20020806","1997","","","569","578","In the layout design of transport-processing FPGAs, it is not only required that routing congestion be kept small but also that circuits implemented on them should operate with higher operation frequency. This paper extends the proposed simultaneous placement and global routing algorithm for transport-processing FPGAs, whose objective is to minimize the routing congestion, and proposes a new algorithm, in which the length of each critical signal path (path length) is limited within a specified upper bound imposed on it (path length constraint). The algorithm is based on the hierarchical bipartitioning of the layout regions and LUT (lookup table) sets that are to be placed. Each bipartitioning procedure consists of three phases: (1) estimation of path lengths, (2) bipartitioning of a set of terminals, and (3) bipartitioning of a set of LUTs. After searching the paths with tighter path length constraints by estimating the path lengths in (1), phases (2) and (3) are executed so that their path lengths are reduced with higher priority, and thus path length constraints are not violated.

During the characterization, input slew rate, output loading, capacitive feedthrough effect and the logic state dependence of nodes in a cell are all taken into account. The characterization methodology separates the power consumption of a cell into three components, e.g., capacitive feedthrough power, short-circuit power, and dynamic power. With the characterization data, a cell-based power estimator (CBPE) embedded in Verilog-XL is used for estimating the power consumption of a circuit. CB-Power is also a hierarchical power estimator.

We show that the dynamic power consumption at saturation frequencies is only dependent on the supply voltage, and is independent of load capacitance and switching speed. This model shows that when a circuit is working in the saturation frequency range, as the frequency is increased, the performance/power ratio is increased. However, this increase in performance/power ratio is at the expense of noise margin. The model is theoretically and empirically shown to be correct.

A linear (non-integral) programming approach to two-layer constrained via minimization (CVM) is presented. The approach finds optimum solutions for routings containing no more than three way splits, and guarantees provably good results for the general case. Most importantly, the size of linear programming formulation is polynomial in terms of the size of the CVM problem. The significance of the work lies in three aspects. First, since linear programming can be solved in polynomial time, the work thus provides, for the first time, a mathematical programming solution with computational efficiency comparable to known combinatorial CVM algorithms. Second, the compact linear programming approach is provably good and natural for general CVM, while previous restricted CVM algorithms are difficult to he extended to the general case. Third, the approach can handle additional constraints in a unified manner, and thus provides an efficient method for performance-driven layer assignment. The approach is based on some new graph-theoretic and polyhedron-combinatorial results presented on the structure of the CVM problem","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600347","","Cities and towns;Computational efficiency;Integrated circuit layout;Linear programming;Minimization;Polynomials;Printed circuits;Routing;Transmission line theory;Wire","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;graph theory;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;linear programming;minimisation;network routing;printed circuit layout","compact linear programming;computational efficiency;graph-theoretic results;integrated circuit layout design;mathematical programming solution;optimum routing solutions;performance-driven layer assignment;polyhedron-combinatorial results;printed circuit board design;two-layer constrained via minimization solution","","0","","15","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of a differential logic circuit (DLC) with a pair of dual-rail inputs makes the input voltage swing small, which results in a high driving capability at a lower supply voltage, while having large static power dissipation. In the proposed DLC using switched current control, the static power dissipation is greatly reduced because current sources in non-active circuit blocks are switched off. In the current control, no additional transistors are required to control the current sources because a current-control circuit is already used in the threshold detector. As a typical example of arithmetic circuits, a new 1.5 V-supply 54×54-bit multiplier based on a 0.8 μm standard CMOS technology is also designed.

The second one is to rearrange primary inputs on the basis of the closeness that represents the number of overlapping gates between fan-out regions.

The requirements of speed independent circuits can then be completely transformed into the CG.

It will be demonstrated that AND/OR reasoning graphs allow us to naturally extend basic notions of two-level switching circuit theory to multi-level circuits.

(1994), Takashima et al. (1996) and Wu et al. (1996). It was shown that GRAs have good mapping properties. An H-tree GRA with W/sup 2/+2W switches per switch box (SpSB) and a 2D array GRA with 4W/sup 2/+2W SpSB were proposed by those authors (W is the number of tracks in each switch box). We continue this work by introducing an H-tree GRA with W/sup 2//2+2W SpSB and a 2D array GRA with 3.5 W/sup 2/+2 W SpSB. These new GRAs have the same good mapping properties but use fewer switches. We also show a class of FPGA architectures in which the mapping problem remains NP-complete, even with 6(W-1)/sup 2/+6W/sup 2/ SpSB (this is close to the maximum number of SpSB, which is 6W/sup 2/).

In this approach, a BDD is modified so that each node of the BDD has another branch which is an exclusive-OR of the two branches of a node. Once the modified BDD is obtained, a traversal of the BDD is sufficient to generate the Maitra terms needed. Since a BDD can be traversed in O(n) steps, where it is the number of nodes in the BDD, Maitra terms are generated very efficiently.

This feature is invaluable in most microprocessors because the branch target address is usually misaligned, and many of data accesses are misaligned. 8K-byte SEWD cache chip consists of 489,000 transistors on a die size of 0.853×0.827 cm <sup>2</sup> and is implemented in 0.8 μm DLM CMOS process operating at 60 MHz","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600360","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Clocks;Decoding;Microprocessors;Pipelines;Prefetching;System performance;Transistors;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;cache storage;decoding;instruction sets;microprocessor chips","CMOS process;instruction prefetch;microprocessors;misaligned data;pipeline stall;prefetch codes;separated word-line decoding cache;single cycle access cache;system performance","","0","6","3","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for many functions, the minimum GRM can be much worse than the ESOP. We have defined a Shared Multiple Rooted XOR-based Decomposition Diagram (XORDD) to represent functions with multiple outputs. By iteratively applying transformations and reductions, we obtain a compact XORDD which gives a minimized ESOP. Our method can synthesize larger circuits than previously possible. The compact ESOP representation provides a form that is easier to synthesize for XOR heavy multilevel circuit, such as arithmetic functions. The method successfully minimized large functions with multiple outputs. Results are also compared to the minimized SOP's obtained from ESPRESSO.

The method treats device noise sources with arbitrarily shaped PSDs (including thermal, shot and flicker noises) handles noise input correlations and computes correlations between different outputs. The HPSD formulation is also used to establish the non-intuitive result that bandpass filtering of cyclostationary noise can result in stationary noise. The new technique is illustrated using an example that exhibits noise folding and interaction between harmonic PSD components. The results are validated against Monte-Carlo simulations.

Most of traditional MINs are blocking networks and packets are transferred in the store-and-forward manner between switching elements with bit-parallel (8-64bits) lines. Since the width of communication paths and transferred manner cause pin-limitation problems and complicated structure, the high density implementation and high speed clock is not utilized. In order to solve these problems, we implemented the SSS-PBSF chip.

As we are entering the deep-submicron era, the approach is no longer appropriate because the wiring delay must be characterized based on a distributed-RC model, in which not only the wiring area but also the wiring topology affects the wiring delay. In this paper, we show that the half-perimeter metric does not correlate well with the wiring delay under the distributed-RC model. We show that the radius of a net estimates the wiring delay more accurately than the half-perimeter metric does.

From these projections of the overall technology characteristics are derived for the needs for packaging and assembly technologies that support and enable this dynamic growth. In the present paper, we shall provide detailed discussions of the potential solutions for the high density substrates and the issues that the wafer development brings to the creation of packaging solutions for future electronic systems. The most apparent changes to the packaging technology requirements changes have been driven by the increase in chip speed and functionality, the materials set for wafer level interconnect, and the power requirements. These quantities have driven the derived needs for greater and greater interconnect to and from the chip, different materials for packaging solutions, more effective thermal management, and software systems to design and model it all. The package is also shrinking to meet the miniaturization requirements of many of the hand-held products.

In this work, we present two sets of results: (i) new techniques for flat FM-based hypergraph partitioning (which is the core of multilevel implementations), and (ii) a new multilevel implementation that offers leading-edge performance. Our new techniques for flat partitioning confirm the conjecture that specialized partitioning heuristics may be able to actively exploit fixed nodes in partitioning instances arising in the driving top-down placement context. Our FM variant is competitive with traditional FM on instances without terminals and considerably superior on instances with fixed nodes (i.e., arising during top-down placement). Our multilevel FM variant avoids several complex heuristics and non-trivial tunings that often lead to complex implementations; it achieves trade-offs between solution quality and run time that are comparable or better than those achieved by hMetis-1.5.3. We attempt to provide algorithm descriptions that are as detailed and unambiguous as possible, to allow replicability and speed improvements in future research.","","0-7803-5973-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835182","","Circuits;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Design automation;Design optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Runtime;Software algorithms;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;directed graphs;iterative methods;logic partitioning","VLSI CAD physical design;balance constraints;driving top-down placement;fixed nodes;flat hypergraph partitioning;hypergraph bipartitioning;improved algorithms;iterative algorithm;multilevel Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning;multilevel implementation;specialized partitioning heuristics;speed improvements","","33","2","24","","","9-9 June 2000","25 Jan 2000-28 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finding the optimal storage of the usually large arrays from these behavioral specifications is an important step during memory allocation. This paper proposes more efficient algorithms for the intra-array storage mapping models of De Greef (De Greef, et al., 1997) and Troncon (Troncon, et al., 2002), resulting in an implementation several time faster than the original ones.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196079","","Array signal processing;Computer science;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy storage;Lattices;Signal analysis;Signal mapping;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","digital storage;embedded systems;multimedia systems","mapping analysis;multimedia signal processing;signal to memory;storage mapping","","2","","13","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BIST diagnosis problem has applications that include identification of erroneous test vectors, faulty scan cells, faulty modules, and faulty logic blocks in FPGAs. We develop an abstract model of this problem and show a fundamental correspondence to the well-established subject of combinatorial group testing (CGT) [Ding-Zhu Du et al., (1994)]. Armed with this new perspective, we show how to improve on a number of existing techniques in the VLSI diagnosis literature. In addition, we adapt and apply a number of CGT algorithms that are well-suited to the diagnosis problem in the digital realm. We also propose completely new methods and empirically evaluate the different algorithms. Our experiments show that results of the proposed algorithms outperform recent diagnosis techniques [J. Ghosh-Dastidar et al. (1999), (2000), J. Rajski et al. (1997)]. Finally, we point out future directions that can lead to new solutions for the BIST diagnosis problem.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337550","","Built-in self-test;DSL;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Logic testing;Shift registers;Test pattern generators;Very large scale integration","VLSI;built-in self test;computational complexity;fault diagnosis;field programmable gate arrays","BIST diagnosis problem;FPGA;VLSI diagnosis literature;combinatorial group testing method;digital logic system;faulty logic block;faulty modules;faulty scan cells","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we propose a new timing-aware multilevel clustering algorithm that uses the connection strength of an edge as the primary objective, and the maximum depth or the maximum hop-count of any path containing the edge as a tiebreaker for the clustering step. These ideas are integrated into a general multilevel partitioning framework, which consists of three phases: uncoarsening, initial partitioning, and coarsening and refinement phases. The benchmarks show that, on average, we can reduce delay by 14.6%, while increasing the cutsize by 1.2% when compared to hMetis (Karygpis et al., 1997).","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466201","","Circuit analysis;Clustering algorithms;Delay effects;Logic circuits;Partitioning algorithms;Performance gain;Portable media players;Runtime;Signal processing;Timing","integrated circuit layout;logic partitioning;pattern clustering","I/O conduits;coarsening phase;connection strength;initial partitioning phase;maximum depth;maximum hop-count;move-based partitioning strategy;performance-driven multilevel partitioning;preferred signal direction aggregation;refinement phase;timing-aware multilevel clustering algorithm;uncoarsening phase","","1","","15","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reasonable cuts can bring less time consuming to combinational verification. We embed the technique into sequential equivalence checking. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve about 2× speedup over the original one.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466206","","Application specific integrated circuits;Equations;Laboratories;Sequential circuits","combinational circuits;formal verification;logic testing;sequential circuits","Van Eijk algorithm;combinational verification;cutpoints technique;large scale circuits;sequential equivalence checking","","0","","9","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
