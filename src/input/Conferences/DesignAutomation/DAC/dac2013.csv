The Design TWG is also responsible for the ITRS' System Drivers Chapter, which roadmaps the key product classes that drive the leading-edge requirements for process and design technologies. Through these activities, the Design TWG sets a number of fundamental parameters in the overall ITRS: layout density, die size, maximum on-chip clock frequency, total chip power, SOC and MPU architecture models, etc. This paper reviews the process by which the Design TWG evolves its roadmap content, and some of the key modeling and roadmapping questions that the semiconductor and EDA industries will face in the near term.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560627","","Computer architecture;FinFETs;Layout;Random access memory;System-on-chip;Technological innovation;Vehicles","electronic design automation;integrated circuit layout;supply chains;system-on-chip","EDA;ITRS design technology;International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors;MPU architecture models;SOC;die size;electronic design automation;layout density;on-chip clock frequency;semiconductor supply chain;system drivers roadmap","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice this means the inclusion of cryptographic algorithms of sufficient cryptographic strength. For battery operated devices or for passively powered devices, these cryptographic algorithms need highly efficient, low power, low energy realizations. Moreover, unique to cryptographic implementations is that they also need protection against physical tampering either active or passive. This means that countermeasures need to be included during the design process. Similar to design for low energy, design for physical protection needs to be addressed at all design abstraction levels. Differently, while skipping one optimization step in a design for low energy or low power, merely reduces the battery life time, skipping a countermeasure, means opening the door for a possible attack. Designing for security requires a thorough threat analysis and a balanced selection of countermeasures. This paper will discuss the different abstraction layers and design methods applied to obtain low power/low energy and at the same time side-channel and fault attack resistant cryptographic implementations. To provide a variety of security features, including location privacy, it is clear that medical devices need public key cryptography (PKC). It will be illustrated with the design of a low energy elliptic curve based public key programmable co-processor. It only needs 5.1μJ of energy in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology for one point multiplication and includes a selected set of countermeasures against physical attacks.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560608","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cryptography;Power demand;Privacy;Protocols;Sensors","CMOS integrated circuits;biomedical equipment;coprocessors;data privacy;integrated circuit design;medical computing;public key cryptography","0.13 μm CMOS technology;abstraction layers;battery life time reduction;battery operated devices;cryptographic algorithms;cryptographic strength;design abstraction levels;design dimension;design methods;location privacy;low energy elliptic curve based public key programmable corocessor;low energy realizations;low power realizations;low-energy encryption;passively powered devices;physical protection;public key cryptography;security features;smart medical devices","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These tools, and the abstractions they are based on, were originally intended to handle designs of millions of gates or less. They are not up to the task of handling today's billion-gate designs. The result is months of delay and considerable labor from final RTL to tapeout. Surprises in timing closure, global congestion, and power consumption are common. Even taking an existing design to a new process node is a time-consuming and laborious process. Twenty-first century CAD tools should be based on higher-level abstractions to enable billion-gate chips to go from final RTL to tapeout in days, not months. Key to attaining this increase in productivity is raising the level of design and using simple, standard interfaces. Designs should be composed from high-level modules - processors, MODEMs, CODECs, memory subsystems, and I/O subsystems - rather than gates and flip-flops. Each module, which we expect to contain 100 thousand to 10 million gates, is easily laid out by today's tools, is placed as a unit, and communicates over a NoC via a standard interface. Restricting modules to standard sizes and aspect ratios further simplifies physical design. We expect even a large chip to contain at most a few thousand such modules and expect the physical design and chip-assembly to take a few days with minimal labor after completion of the module-level design.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560687","Chiplet;Design automation;Digital design;Modularity;NoC","Logic gates;Standards;Synchronization;System-on-chip;Tiles;Wiring","circuit CAD;network-on-chip","NoC;RTL;aspect ratio;billion-gate designs;chip-assembly;codec;digital design tools;flip-flops;high-level modules;memory subsystems;modem;module-level design;power consumption;processors;twenty-first century CAD tools","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regarding the system architecture, we present challenges in the domain of communication and computation platforms. A paradigm shift towards time-triggered in-vehicle communication systems becomes inevitable for the sake of determinism, making the introduction of new bus systems and protocols necessary. At the same time, novel computational devices promise high processing power at low cost which will make a reduction in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) possible. As a result, the software design has to be performed in a holistic manner, considering the controlled component while transparently abstracting the underlying hardware architecture. For this purpose, we show how middleware and verification techniques can help to reduce the design and test complexity. At the same time, with the growing connectivity of EVs, security has to become a major design objective, considering possible threats and a security-aware design as discussed in this paper.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560688","Electric Vehicle;Software Design;System Architecture","Batteries;Computer architecture;Electric motors;Hardware;Protocols;Software design;Vehicles","automotive electronics;battery powered vehicles;computational complexity;computerised instrumentation;energy conservation;field buses;middleware;motor drives;road safety;safety-critical software","ECU;EV energy efficiency;EV safety;EV-specific components;bus systems;communication platforms;computation platforms;computational devices;drive-by-wire systems;electric motor;electric powertrain;electric vehicles;electronic control units;hardware architecture;information systems;protocols;security-aware design;software design challenges;system architecture;time-triggered in-vehicle communication systems;verification techniques","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Relax-and-Retime: A methodology for energy-efficient recovery based design","Ramasubramanian, S.G.; Venkataramani, S.; Parandhaman, A.; Raghunathan, A.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2013 50th ACM / EDAC / IEEE","20130718","2013","","","1","6","Recovery based design (RBD) is a promising approach for the design of energy-efficient circuits under variations. RBD instruments circuits with mechanisms to identify and correct timing violations, thereby allowing reduced guard bands or design margins. In addition, RBD enables aggressive voltage overscaling to a point where timing errors occur even under nominal conditions. A major barrier to the widespread adoption of RBD is that traditional design practices and synthesis tools result in circuits with so-called“path walls”, leading to an explosion in the number of timing errors beyond a certain critical operating voltage. To alleviate this effect, previous techniques focused on combinational circuit optimizations such as sizing, use of dual Vt,, cells, re-structuring, etc. to favorably reshape the path delay distribution. However, these techniques are limited by the inherent sequential structure of the circuit, which defines the boundaries of the combinational logic. In this work, we explore a completely different approach to synthesize circuits for RBD. We propose the use of retiming, a well-known and powerful sequential optimization technique to redefine the boundaries of combinational logic, thereby creating new opportunities for RBD that cannot be explored by previous techniques. We make the key observation that, in retiming circuits with RBD (unlike classical retiming), it is acceptable for a few paths in the circuit to exceed the clock period. Using this insight, we propose a synthesis methodology, Relax-and-Retire, wherein the original circuit is relaxed by ignoring timing constraints on selected paths that are bottlenecks to retiming. When classical minimum period retiming is employed on this relaxed circuit, the path wall is shifted to a lower delay, thus allowing additional voltage overscaling. The Relax-and-Retire methodology judiciously selects bottleneck paths by trading off recovery overheads caused by timing errors due to these path- with the opportunities for retiming. We utilize the proposed methodology to synthesize a wide range of benchmarks including arithmetic circuits, ISCAS89 benchmarks and modules from the UltraSPARC T1 processor. Our results demonstrate 9-25% (average of 15.3%) improvement in overall energy compared to a well-optimized baseline with RBD.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560704","Low Power Design;Recovery Based Design;Retiming","Clocks;Delays;Error analysis;Logic gates;Registers;Sequential circuits","benchmark testing;circuit optimisation;clocks;combinational circuits;digital arithmetic;logic design;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;timing circuits","ISCAS89 benchmarks;RBD;UltraSPARC T1 processor;aggressive voltage overscaling;arithmetic circuits;circuit synthesis;clock period;combinational logic;critical operating voltage;energy efficient circuit design;energy efficient recovery-based design;minimum period retiming;path delay distribution;path walls;recovery overheads;relax-and-retime methodology;relaxed circuit;retiming circuits;sequential optimization technique;timing constraints;timing errors;timing violation correction;timing violation identification","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the majority of the prior studies on MLC ReRAM are at the device level. The design implications for MLC ReRAM at the circuit and system levels remain to be explored. This paper aim to provide the first comprehensive investigation of the design trade-offs involved in MLC ReRAM. Our study indicates that different resistance allocation schemes, programming strategies, peripheral designs, and material selections profoundly affect the area, latency, power, and reliability of MLC ReRAM.

Joint exploration and optimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required to overcome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches for such exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostly rely on trial-and-error-based ad-hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic framework which quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay and noise margin, and automatically explores the large space of CNT processing options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.

Recently, several RCEs [1-4] based on global routing engines are developed, but they typically ignore the effects of routing on timing so that the identified routing paths may be overlong and thus impractical. To be aware of the timing issues, our proposed global-routing-based RCE obeys the layer directive and scenic constraints to respectively limit the routing layers and the maximum routing wirelength of the potentially timing-critical nets. To handle the scenic constrains, we propose a novel method based on a relaxation-legalization scheme. Also, because the work in [5] reveals that congestion ratio is a better indicator than overflow to evaluate routability, this work focuses on minimizing the congestion ratio rather than overflows. As will be shown, the problem of minimizing congestion ratio is more complicated than minimizing overflows, so we develop a new rip-up and rerouting scheme to reduce congestion and further to approach a target congestion ratio. Moreover, to fit the demands of practical uses, this work presents a control utility to trade off runtime and quality, which is an essential function to an industrial RCE tool. Experiments reveal that the proposed RCE is faster and more accurate than another industrial global-routing-based RCE.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560685","Congestion estimation;global routing;routability","Estimation;Generators;Routing;Runtime;Throughput;Timing","network routing;network synthesis","congestion ratio minimization;control utility;global routing engines;identified routing paths;industrial RCE tool;industrial design flow;industrial global-routing-based RCE;maximum routing wirelength;real design constraints;relaxation-legalization scheme;rip-up-rerouting scheme;routing congestion estimation","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic physical constraints. As a result, it decreases the likelihood of erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced time-to-results, less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of precious samples and reagents.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560637","Digital microfluidics;electrowetting-on-dielectric;lab-on-chip","Clocks;Electrodes;Libraries;Sensors;Sequential analysis;Time-frequency analysis;Uncertainty","lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics","completion-time uncertainties;cyberphysical digital microfluidic biochips;erroneous reaction;mixing;operation-interdependency-aware synthesis method;reaction-outcome detection;software-based control;thermal cycling","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-level error injections at the architecture or memory levels are generally fast but can be inaccurate. Unfortunately, there exists very little research literature on quantitative analysis of the inaccuracies associated with high-level error injection techniques. In this paper, we use simulation and emulation results to understand the accuracy tradeoffs associated with a variety of high-level error injection techniques.

SCA has emerged as a serious threat to many mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems. From an attacker's point of view, the difficulty of mounting SCA largely depends on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the side-channel information. It has been shown that SNR primarily depends on algorithmic and circuit-level implementation, measurement noise, as well as device thermal noise. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on the effect of power delivery network (PDN) on SCA resistance. We note that the PDN plays a significant role in SNR of measured supply current. Furthermore, SCA resistance strongly depends on the operating frequency due to RLC structure of a power grid. In this paper, we analyze the effect of power grid on SCA and provide quantitative results to demonstrate the frequency-dependent SCA resistance due to PDN-induced noise. This property can potentially be exploited by an attacker to facilitate the attack by operating a device at favorable frequency points. On the other hand, from a designer's perspective, one can explore countermeasures to secure the device at all operating frequencies while minimizing the design overhead. Based on this observation, we propose a frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique to efficiently protect against SCA. Simulation results using realistic PDN model as well as experimental measurements using FPGA test board validate the observations on role of PDN in SCA and the efficacy of the proposed compensation approach.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560671","DPA;SCA resistance;Side-channel attack (SCA);noise injection;power delivery network","Clocks;Cryptography;Nickel;Resistance;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","compensation;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;power grids;telecommunication channels","FPGA test board;PDN model;PDN-induced noise;RLC structure;SCA resistance;SNR;circuit-level implementation;compensation approach;crypto chips;frequency-dependent SCA resistance;frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique;mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems;measurement noise;physical parameters;power delivery network;power-grid-aware secure design;secret information extraction;side channel attack;signal-to-noise ratio","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the case of network-on-chip (NoC), this means each packet of a traffic stream has to be delivered within a time interval. In addition, with the increasing complexity of NoC, it consumes a significant portion of total chip power, which boosts the power footprint of such chips. In this work, we propose a methodology to minimize the energy consumption of NoC without violating the prespecified latency deadlines of real-time applications. First, we develop a formal approach based on network calculus to obtain the worst-case delay bound of all packets, from which we derive a safe estimate of the number of cycles that a packet can be further delayed in the network without violating its deadline- the worst-case slack. With this information, we then develop an optimization algorithm that trades the slacks for lower NoC energy. Our algorithm recognizes the distribution of slacks for different traffic streams, and assigns different voltages and frequencies to different routers to achieve NoC energy-efficiency, while meeting the deadlines for all packets.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560630","Network calculus;Network-on-Chip;Voltage-frequency scaling","Analytical models;Calculus;Delays;Embedded systems;Heuristic algorithms;Switches;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC complexity;chip power;energy consumption minimization;energy-efficient NoC design;formal approach;interconnection subsystems;latency requirement;network calculus;network-on-chip;real-time embedded systems;routers;slack optimization;time interval;traffic stream;traffic streams","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The large device variations and the thermal-induced switching randomness of the magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) introduce the persistent and non-persistent errors in STT-RAM operations, respectively. Modeling these statistical metrics generally require the expensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the combined magnetic-CMOS models, which is hardly integrated in the modern micro-architecture and system designs. Also, the conventional bottom-up design method incurs costly iterations in the STT-RAM design toward specific system requirement. In this work, we propose Loadsa<sup>1</sup>: a yield-driven top-down design method to explore the design space of STT-RAM array from a statistical point of view. Both array-level semi-analytical yield model and cell-level failure-probability model are developed to enable a top-down design method: The system-level requirements, e.g., the chip yield under power and area constraints, are hierarchically mapped to array-and cell-level design parameters, e.g., redundancy, ECC scheme, and MOS transistor size, etc. Our simulation results show that Loadsa can accurately optimize the STT-RAM based on the system and cell-level constraints with a linear computation complexity. Our method demonstrates great potentials in the early design stage of memory or micro-architecture by eliminating the design integrations, while offering a full statistical view of the design even when the common yield enhancement practices are applied.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509611","","Computational modeling;Design methodology;Error correction codes;Magnetic tunneling;Memory management;Redundancy;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;random-access storage","Loadsa;STT-RAM array;common yield enhancement;expensive Monte-Carlo simulations;magnetic tunneling junction;magnetic-CMOS models;microarchitecture;nonvolatile memory technology;spin-transfer torque random access memory;system designs;thermal-induced switching randomness;yield-driven top-down design method","","2","","14","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On potential design impacts of electromigration awareness","Kahng, A.B.; Nath, S.; Rosing, T.S.","CSE Depts., UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC), 2013 18th Asia and South Pacific","20130427","2013","","","527","532","Reliability issues significantly limit performance improvements from Moore's-Law scaling. At 45nm and below, electromigration (EM) is a serious reliability issue which affects global and local interconnects in a chip and limits performance scaling. Traditional IC implementation flows meet a 10-year lifetime requirement by overdesigning and sacrificing performance. At the same time, it is well-known among circuit designers that Black's Equation [2] suggests that lifetime can be traded for performance. In our work, we carefully study the impacts of EM-awareness on IC implementation outcomes, and show that circuit performance does not trade off so smoothly with mean time to failure (MTTF) as suggested by Black's Equation. We conduct two basic studies: EM lifetime versus performance with fixed resource budget, and EM lifetime versus resource with fixed performance. Using design examples implemented in two process nodes, we show that performance scaling achieved by reducing the EM lifetime requirement depends on the EM slack in the circuit, which in turn depends on factors such as timing constraints, length of critical paths and the mix of cell sizes. Depending on these factors, the performance gain can range from 10% to 80% when the lifetime requirement is reduced from 10 years to one year. We show that at a fixed performance requirement, power and area resources are affected by the timing slack and can either decrease by 3% or increase by 7.8% when the MTTF requirement is reduced. We also study how conventional EM fixes using per net Non-Default Rule (NDR) routing, downsizing of drivers, and fanout reduction affect performance at reduced lifetime requirements.

By blending uncorrelated clock edges, the output clock edges approach the ideal timing and, thus, timing jitter can be reduced by a factor of √2 per stage. There are three technical challenges to realize this: 1) generating uncorrelated clock edges, 2) phase averaging with small time offset from the ideal center position, and 3) minimizing the error in nT-delay being deviated from ideal nT. The proposed circuit overcomes each of these by exploiting an nT-delay, gated phase blending, and self-calibrated nT-delay elements, respectively.

One way to implement the 3D IC is to interconnect layers of two-dimensional (2D) IC with Through-Silicon Via (TSV), which shortens the signal lengths. Unfortunately, while TSVs are bundled together as a cluster, the crosstalk coupling noise may lead to transmission errors. As a result, the working frequency of TSVs has to be lowered to avoid the errors, leading to narrower bandwidth that TSVs can provide. In this paper, we first derive the crosstalk noise model from the perspective of 3D chip and then propose ShieldUS, a runtime data-to-TSVs remapping strategy. With ShieldUS, the transition patterns of data over TSVs are observed at runtime, and relatively stable bits will be mapped to the TSVs which act as shields to protect the other bits which have more fluctuations. We evaluate the performance of ShieldUS with address lines from real benchmark traces and data lines of different similarities. The results show that ShieldUS is accurate and flexible. We further study dynamic shielding and our design of Interval Equilibration Unit (IEU) can intelligently select suitable parameters for dynamic shielding, which makes dynamic shielding practical and does not need to predefine parameters. This also improves the practicability of ShieldUS.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509678","","Crosstalk;Equations;Mathematical model;Noise;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","crosstalk;integrated circuit noise;low-power electronics;shielding;three-dimensional integrated circuits","2D IC;3D IC;3D TSV crosstalk coupling noise;3D chip;ShieldUS;dynamic shielding;integrated circuits;interval equilibration unit;low power consumption;through silicon via;transmission errors","","1","","18","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, it is desirable to simultaneously consider the co-design of the interposer and multiple chips mounted on it. This paper addresses the first work of chip-interposer codesign to place multiple chips on an interposer to reduce inter-chip wirelength.

As a result, the errors introduced in the responses, must occur during unloading of the scan chains. Diagnosis can then be performed by directly comparing the actual and expected responses without any fault simulation - leading to significant reduction in time.

The router adopts a two-stage approach of topology generation followed by detailed routing to route unit capacitors such that the coupling-aware wire length ratio can match the desired capacitance ratio. Given a length ratio, in particular, the length-ratio-matching routing problem can be handled by transforming the problem into an easier classical wirelength minimization one.

For electric vehicles, software functions play an essential role, replacing hydraulic and mechanic control systems. While model-based software development and verification are already used extensively in the automotive domain, their importance significantly increases in electric vehicles as safety-critical functions might no longer rely on mechanical (fall-back) solutions. The need for reducing costs, size, and weight in electric vehicles has also resulted in a considerable interest in topics such as the consolidation of ECUs as well as efficient implementation of control software. In this paper we discuss two broad issues related to model-based software development and verification in electric vehicles. The first is concerned with how to ensure that model-level semantics are preserved in an implementation, which has important implications on the verification and certification of control software. The second issue is related to techniques for reducing the computational and communication demands of distributed automotive control algorithms.

A general trend in IWMDs is towards increased functional complexity, software programmability, and connectivity to body area networks (BANs). However, as medical devices become more “intelligent,” they also become less trustworthy - less reliable and more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Various shortcomings - hardware failures, software errors, wireless attacks, malware and software exploits, and side-channel attacks - could undermine the trustworthiness of IWMDs and BANs. The trustworthiness of IWMDs must be addressed aggressively and proactively due to the potential for catastrophic consequences. While some recent efforts address the defense of IWMDs against specific security attacks, a holistic strategy that considers all concerns and types of threats is required. This paper discusses trustworthiness concerns in IWMDs and BANs through a comprehensive identification and analysis of potential threats and, for each threat, provides a discussion of the merits and inadequacies of current solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560607","Design;Reliability;Security","Biomedical monitoring;Communication system security;Cryptography;Hardware;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical communication;body area networks;invasive software;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;prosthetics;trusted computing","BAN;IWMD;body area network;catastrophic consequence;functional complexity;hardware failure;implantable medical device;malicious attack;malware;medical condition diagnosis;medical condition monitoring;medical condition treatment;security attack;side-channel attack;software error;software exploit;software programmability;trustworthy medical device;wearable medical device;wireless attack","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To facilitate monitoring and control, IMDs are often equipped with wireless interfaces. While convenient, wireless connectivity raises the risk of malicious access to an IMD that can potentially infringe patients' privacy and even endanger their lives. Thus, while ease of access to IMDs can be vital for timely medical intervention, too much ease is dangerous. Obvious approaches, such as passwords and certificates, are unworkable at large scale given the lack of central authorities and frequent emergencies in medical settings. Additionally, IMDs are heavily constrained in their power consumption and computational capabilities. Designing access-control mechanisms for IMDs that can meet the many constraints of real-world deployment is an important research challenge. In this paper, we review proposed approaches to the accesscontrol problem for IMDs, including the problem of secure pairing (and key distribution) between an IMD and another device, such as a programmer. (We also treat related technologies, such as bodyarea networks.) We describe some limitations of well-conceived proposals and reveal security weaknesses in two proposed cryptographic pairing schemes. Our intention is to stimulate yet more inventive and rigorous research in the intriguing and challenging areas of IMD security and medical-device security in general.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560606","Design;Security;Usability","Batteries;Cryptography;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Protocols","authorisation;biomedical equipment;condition monitoring;cryptography;data privacy;embedded systems;emergency services;patient monitoring;patient treatment;peripheral interfaces;prosthetics","IMD security;access control mechanism;central authority;cryptographic pairing scheme;embedded system;frequent emergency;implantable medical device security;malicious access risk;patient medical condition monitoring;patient privacy;patient treatment;power consumption;secure pairing;security balance;wireless connectivity;wireless interface","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This human intervention is often paved with many errors that are bound to typical logic functional failures. Debugging these errors can be a resource intensive process that requires considerable manual effort. This discourages engineers and achieving power savings at the micro level of the design sometimes remains unrealized. This paper proposes a novel debugging methodology to rectify erroneous clock-gating implementations. With the use of Partial Max-SAT, the method localizes and rectifies the design error introduced in the circuit during a clock-gating implementation.

Contiguous and unfragmented area mapping is to settle the communicating tasks in close proximity. Hence, the power dissipation, the congestion between different applications, and the latency of the system will be significantly reduced. To find an optimum region, we first propose an approximate model that quickly estimates the available area around a given node. Then the stochastic hill climbing algorithm is used as a search heuristic to find a node that has the required number of available nodes around it. Presented agile climber takes the steps using an adapted version of hill climbing algorithm named Smart Hill Climbing, SHiC, which takes the runtime status of the system into account. Finally, the application mapping is performed starting from the selected first node. Experiments show significant gain in the mapping contiguousness which results in better network latency and power dissipation, compared to state-of-the-art works.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560632","AI algorithms;Application mapping;Hill climbing;On-chip many-core systems;Task allocation","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Dispersion;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Power dissipation;Resource management","heuristic programming;microprocessor chips;search problems;stochastic processes;system-on-chip","MPSoC;SHiC;agile dynamic mapping;agile run-time task allocation scheme;close proximity;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;network latency;network-based many-core system;optimum contiguous area;power dissipation;search heuristic algorithm;smart hill climbing;stochastic hill climbing algorithm;task communication;unfragmented area mapping;unpredictable workload","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conventional approaches for processor voltage and frequency adjustment are not suitable for streaming multimedia applications due to the cyclic nature of dependencies in the executing tasks which can potentially violate the throughput constraints. In this paper, we propose a methodology that applies DVFS for such cyclic dependent tasks. The methodology involves an off-line analysis that assumes worst-case execution times of tasks to identify the executions that can be slowed down and an on-line analysis to utilize the slacks arising from tasks that finish their execution before the worst-case execution times. Thus, the methodology minimizes energy consumption during both off-line and on-line analysis while satisfying the throughput constraints. Experiments based on models of real-life streaming multimedia applications show that the proposed methodology reduces the overall energy consumption by 43% when compared to existing approaches.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560708","Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip;energy consumption;streaming applications;throughput constraint","Algorithm design and analysis;Decoding;Energy consumption;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Throughput;Tiles","electronic engineering computing;energy conservation;energy consumption;media streaming;multimedia systems;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;system-on-chip","DVFS;MPSoC;cyclic dependent task;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy optimization;execution slacks;frequency adjustment;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;off-line analysis;online analysis;processor voltage;real-life streaming multimedia application;throughput constraint;worst-case execution time","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One effective defect mitigation approach is to cover defects by device features, such that the defects will no longer be printable. Normally die size is much smaller than the exposure field on the blank, such that one blank can accommodate multiple copies of a die, each of which can be placed independently within the exposure field. For thorough utilization of blank area, the number of valid dies that are not impacted by any defects should be maximized. To do so, all relocation positions to place a single valid die on a defective blank must be determined first [1]. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work can find all relocation positions throughout the whole blank in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. The time complexity of our algorithm is linear in the number of features in the die. Experimental results with full die layouts generated from a standard cell library validate the efficiency of our algorithm.

Since many of the known quantum algorithms include a large Boolean component (e.g. the database in the Grover search algorithm), quantum circuits are commonly synthesized in a two-stage approach. First, the desired function is realized as a reversible circuit making use of existing synthesis methods for this domain. Afterwards, each reversible gate is mapped to a functionally equivalent quantum gate cascade. In this paper, we propose an improved mapping of reversible circuits to quantum circuits which exploits a certain structure of many reversible circuits. In fact, it can be observed that reversible circuits are often composed of similar gates which only differ in the position of their target lines. We introduce an extension of reversible gates which allow multiple target lines in a single gate. This enables a significantly cheaper mapping to quantum circuits. Experiments show that considering multiple target lines leads to improvements of up to 85% in the resulting quantum cost.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509587","","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Libraries;Logic gates;Merging;Quantum computing;Quantum entanglement","quantum gates","Grover search algorithm;functionally equivalent quantum gate cascade;large Boolean component;multiple target lines;quantum algorithms;quantum circuits;reversible circuits;reversible gate","","3","","21","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To avoid producing an unroutable design, many placers [47] invoke global routers to get a congestion map and then move cells to reduce congestion based on this map. However, as cells move, the accuracy of the congestion map degrades, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the placer in minimizing congestions. Moreover, most global routers [8-13] ignore local congestion. If placers are guided by these routers, it may produce hard-to-route placement solutions in terms of detailed routing. This work develops a routability optimizer, called Ropt, to reduce both global and local routing congestion levels of a given placement. Based on a local-routability-aware routing model, Ropt builds a global routing instance to obtain global and local congestion information for guiding global re-placement. In addition, this work presents a new legalization scheme to preserve the global routing instance after legalization. Finally, local detailed placement further minimizes the local congestion and wirelength. For the evaluation of Ropt, we use an academic global router and a commercial router to obtain both global and detailed routing results, respectively. Experimental results reveal that Ropt can improve the routing quality (in terms of congestion, wirelength, and violation) and routing runtime of a given placement solution.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560746","Placement;detailed routing;global routing;routability optimization","Equations;Estimation;Law;Pins;Routing;Runtime","VLSI;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;network routing","Ropt;VLSI design flow;academic global router;cells;commercial router;congestion map;congestion reduction;detailed routing;global replacement;global routing congestion level;hard-to-route placement solution;legalization scheme;local routing congestion level;local-routability-aware routing model;optimization;routability optimizer;routing quality;routing runtime;wirelength","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) have been adopted to create an optimization system, named BDS, that supports integrated synthesis of both AND/OR- and XOR-intensive functions through functional logic decomposition on the BDD structure. However, it does not support direct decomposition and manipulation of majority logic which, instead, is widely used in datapath circuits.

By taking advantage of multilevel power grid verifications, large-scale power grid current integrity verification tasks can be achieved in a very efficient way. Additionally, a novel EM-aware geometric power grid reduction method is proposed to well preserve the similar geometric and electrical properties of the original grid on the coarse-level power grids, which allows to quickly identify the potential “hot wires” that may carry greater-than-desired currents in a given power grid design. The proposed multilevel power grid verification algorithm provides flexible tradeoffs between the current integrity verification cost and solution quality, while the desired upper/lower bounds for worst case currents flowing through a wire can also be computed efficiently. Extensive experimental results show that our current integrity verification approach can efficiently handle very large power grid designs with good solution quality.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560679","Power grid;electromigration;multigrid","Current density;Power dissipation;Power grids;Sensitivity analysis;Vectors;Wires","electromigration;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability","current integrity verification;electrical property;electromigration phenomenon;geometric power grid reduction method;geometric property;hot wire;large power grid designs;large scale power grid current;multilevel power grid verification algorithm;reliable power delivery network;scalable vectorless power grid","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SNDR simulation for ADCs is selected as the application as ADCs are typical short-memory circuits and the SNDR simulation is very time consuming. Experiments with realistic Flash and SAR ADCs demonstrate 64x-78x speed-ups with 100 CPU cores.

Moreover, the problem becomes much hard to tackle as the delay of clock signals varies dynamically during execution. Recently, it is shown that adjustable delay buffer (ADB) whose delay can be adjusted dynamically can solve the clock skew variation problem effectively. However, inserting ADBs requires non-negligible area and control overhead. Thus, all previous works have invariably aimed at minimizing the number of ADBs to be inserted, particularly under the environment of multiple power modes in which the operating voltage applied to some modules varies as the power mode changes. In this work, unlike the previous works which have solved the ADB minimization problem heuristically or locally optimally, we propose an elegant and easily adoptable solution to overcome the limitation of the previous works. Precisely, we propose an O(n log n) time (bottom-up traversal) algorithm that (1) optimally solves the problem of minimizing the number of ADBs to be inserted with continuous delay of ADBs and (2) enables solving the ADB insertion problem with discrete delay of ADBs to be greatly simple and predictable. In addition, we propose (3) a systematic solution to an important extension to the problem of buffer sizing combined with the ADB insertion to further reduce the ADBs to be used.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560683","","Abstracts","buffer circuits;circuit complexity;circuit optimisation;clocks;delay circuits;integrated circuit design;minimisation;trees (mathematics)","ADB insertion problem;ADB minimization problem;adjustable delay buffer insertion;bottom-up traversal algorithm;buffer sizing;clock signal delay;clock skew constraint;clock skew variation problem;clock trees synthesis;continuous delay;control overhead;discrete delay;operating voltage;optimal algorithm;power mode;time algorithm","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CUDA and OpenCL parallel programming models enable easy utilization of the GPU's resources. However, tuning GPU applications' performance is a complex and labor intensive task. Software programmers employ a variety of optimization techniques to explore tradeoffs between the thread parallelism and performance of a single thread. However, prior techniques ignore register allocation, a significant factor in single thread performance and, indirectly affects the number of simultaneously active threads. In this paper, we show that joint optimization of register allocation and thread structure has great potential to significantly improve performance. However, the design space for this joint optimization can be large; therefore, we develop performance metrics appropriate for evaluation within a compiler's inner loop and efficient design space exploration techniques that use the metrics to narrow the search space. Across a range of GPU applications, we achieve average performance speedup of 1.33X (up to 1.73X) with design space exploration 355X faster than the exhaustive search.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509639","","Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Registers;Resource management;Space exploration","embedded systems;graphics processing units;logic design;optimisation","CUDA;GPU applications;OpenCL parallel programming models;design space exploration techniques;embedded devices;general purpose applications;high performance computing;mobile devices;performance metrics;register allocation;register structure optimization;search space;software programmers;thread parallelism;thread structure optimization","","1","","14","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses this multilayer escape routing problem to minimize the number of used layers in a staggered pin array for manufacturing cost reduction. We first present an escaped pin selection method to assign a maximal number of escaped pins in the current layer and also to increase useful routing regions for subsequent layers.

This paper addresses this problem and presents the first symmetrical buffered clock-tree synthesis flow that considers supply voltage differences of buffers. We employ a two-phase technique of bottom-up clock sink clustering to determine the tree topology, followed by top-down buffer placement and wire routing to complete the clock tree. At each level of processing, clock skew and wirelength are minimized by the determination of buffer embedding regions and the alignment of buffer supply voltages. Experimental results show that our method can reach, on average, respective 76% and 40% clock skew reduction compared to the state-of-the-art work (1) without supply voltage consideration and (2) with an extension for supply voltages based on our top-down flow. The reduction is achieved by marginal resource and runtime overheads. Note that our method can meet the stringent skew constraint set by the 2010 ISPD contest for all cases, while other counterparts cannot.

Existing PUFs, typically acquired and integrated in a design as a commodity, often incur considerable hardware overhead. Many of these PUFs also suffer from insufficient challenge-response pairs. In this paper, we propose ScanPUF, a novel PUF implementation using a common on-chip structure used for improving circuit testability, namely scan chain. It exploits path delay variations between the scan flip-flops in a scan chain to create high-quality (in terms of uniqueness and robustness) secret keys. Furthermore, since a scan chain provides large pool of scan paths to create a signature, we can achieve high volume of secret keys from each chip. Since it uses a prevalent on-chip structure, the overhead is extremely small (2.3% area of the RO-PUF), primarily contributed by small additional logic in the signature-generation cycle controller. Circuit-level simulation results with 1000 chips under inter- and intra-die process variations show high uniqueness of 49.9% average inter-die Hamming distance and good reproducibility of 5% intra-die Hamming distance below 85 °C. The temporal variations due to device aging effect e.g. bias temperature instability (BTI) lead to only 4% unstable bits for ten-year usage. The experimental evaluation on FPGA (Altera Cyclone-III) exhibits 47.1% average inter-Hamming distance, as well as 3.2% unstable bits at room temperature.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509668","","Clocks;Delay lines;Delays;Entropy;Hardware;Logic gates;Synchronization","cryptography;delays;design for testability;field programmable gate arrays;flip-flops;industrial property;integrated circuit testing","FPGA;ScanPUF;chip authentication;circuit testability;circuit-level simulation;cryptographic key generation;device aging effect;diverse hardware security;flip-flops;hardware overhead;intellectual property protection;interdie Hamming distance;intradie Hamming distance;path delay variations;physical unclonable functions;process variations;robust ultralow-overhead PUF;scan chain;scan paths;secret keys;signature-generation cycle controller;temperature 293 K to 298 K","","5","","19","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Range analysis aims to predetermine min/max ranges for variables to reduce the bitwidth required to represent variables in hardware. Bitmask analysis characterizes individual bits within a word as either constants (1 or 0), sign bits, or unknowns, where constants/don't-cares permit hardware to be eliminated under certain conditions. Static compiler-based analysis is contrasted with dynamic profiling-based analysis in terms of their potential to impact area and speed of HLS-generated hardware.

Based on the given timing slack distribution of a circuit, a corresponding “slack mountain map” can be visualized with peaks representing most violating (negative) slacks and valleys representing non-critical (positive) slacks respectively. Guided by this map, violating paths are eliminated or improved when slack mountains are flattened by applying a local logic perturbation technique (rewiring) iteratively to shift logic resources from critical to non-critical areas. Due to the locality property of the rewiring technique, to better avoid being stuck at local minimums, instead of running rewiring operations from the peak top towards lower areas, we do this local logic shifting starting from “sea areas” (most non-critical) towards peak (most critical) areas. At the end, as the slack map is more flattened, a circuit with slack violations more evenly distributed can be yielded. Comparing to the recent work [1], our experimental results demonstrate that this scheme can obtain a better or comparable delay reduction but with CPU time one order of magnitude smaller.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509620","","Central Processing Unit;Delays;Engines;Logic gates;Optimization;Wires","logic circuits;logic design","CPU time;delay reduction;intuitive logic shifting heuristic;local logic perturbation technique;logic synthesis;mountain-mover heuristics;noncritical slacks;post-placement improvement scheme;rewiring technique;sea areas;slack map;slack mountain map;timing slack distribution;timing slack violating paths","","0","","14","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The total sum of these applications is several million lines of software code. The ECUs are connected to different sensors and actuators and communicate via a variety of communication buses like CAN, FlexRay and now also Ethernet. In the case of electric vehicles, both the amount and the importance of such electronics and software are even higher. Here, a number of hydraulic or pneumatic controls are replaced by corresponding software-implemented controllers in order to reduce the overall weight of the car and hence to improve its driving range. Until recently, most of the software and system design in the automotive domain - as in many other domains - relied on an always correctly functioning or a zero-defect hardware implementation platform. However, as the device geometries of integrated circuits continue to shrink, this assumption is increasingly not true. Incorporating large safety margins in the design process results in very pessimistic design and expensive processors. Further, the processors in cars - in contrast to those in many consumer electronics devices like mobile phones - are exposed to harsh environments, extreme temperature variations, and often, strong electromagnetic fields. Hence, their reliability is even more questionable and must be explicitly accounted for in all layers of design abstraction - starting from circuit design to architecture design, to software design and runtime management and monitoring. In this paper we outline some of these issues, currently followed practices, and the challenges that lie ahead of us in the automotive and electric vehicles domain.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560691","Electric vehicles;aging;automotive electronics;cross-layer;embedded systems;process variations;software","Automotive engineering;Degradation;Logic gates;Reliability engineering;Software;Transistors","automotive electronics;electric vehicles;reliability","ECU;Ethernet;FlexRay;architecture design;automotive domain;comfort related functionality;communication buse;consumer electronics device;design abstraction;driver assistance;electric vehicle domain;electric vehicles;electromagnetic field;electronic control unit;expensive processors;hydraulic control;mobile phones;pessimistic design;pneumatic control;reliability challenges;runtime management;safety critical control;software code;software design;system software;zero defect hardware implementation platform","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the observation that HTs are usually activated by dedicated trigger inputs that are not sensitized with verification test cases, VeriTrust automatically identifies such potential HT trigger inputs by examining verification corners. The key difference between VeriTrust and existing HT detection techniques is that VeriTrust is insensitive to the implementation style of HTs.

Memristor technology revitalized neuromorphic computing system design by efficiently executing the analog Matrix-Vector multiplication on the memristor-based crossbar (MBC) structure. However, programming the MBC to the target state can be very challenging due to the difficulty to real-time monitor the memristor state during the training. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the sensitivity of the MBC programming to the process variations and input signal noise. We then proposed a noise-eliminating training method on top of a new crossbar structure to minimize the noise accumulation during the MBC training and improve the trained system performance, i.e.,the pattern recall rate. A digital-assisted initialization step for MBC training is also introduced to reduce the training failure rate as well as the training time. Experimental results show that our noise-eliminating training method can improve the pattern recall rate. For the tested patterns with 128 × 128 pixels our technique can reduce the MBC training time by 12.6% ~ 14.1% for the same pattern recognition rate, or improve the pattern recall rate by 18.7% ~ 36.2% for the same training time.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560600","Memristor;Neuromorphic Computing;Pattern recogniton","Abstracts;Engines;Lead;Memristors;Registers;Training","analogue integrated circuits;computer based training;computerised monitoring;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;interference suppression;matrix multiplication;memristors;neural chips","MBC programming;MBC structure;MBC training time;analog matrix-vector multiplication;digital-assisted initialization step;digital-assisted noise-eliminating training;human-brain;input signal noise;memristor crossbar-based analog neuromorphic computing engine;memristor technology;memristor-based crossbar structure;neuromorphic computing architecture;neuromorphic computing system design;noise accumulation;noise-eliminating training method;pattern recall rate;pattern recognition rate;process variation;real-time monitoring;trained system performance;training failure rate","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For parallel writing in MEBL, a layout is split into stripes and patterns are cut by stripe boundaries, which are defined as stitching lines. Critical patterns cut by stitching lines could suffer from severe pattern distortion or even yield loss. Therefore, considering the positions of stitching lines and avoiding stitching line-induced bad patterns are required during layout design. In this paper, we propose the first work of stitch-aware routing framework for MEBL based on a two-pass bottom-up multilevel router. We first identify three types of stitching line-induced bad patterns which should not exist in an MEBL-friendly routing solution. Then, stitch-aware routing algorithms are respectively developed for global routing, layer/track assignment and detailed routing.

Not only have embedded systems become much more powerful and resources more affordable, we also see a trend towards making embedded devices more consumable, programmable, and customizable by end users. In fact, we see a strong similarity with recent developments in cloud computing. We outline several challenges and opportunities in turning a language runtime system like the Java Virtual Machine into a cloud platform. We focus in particular on support for running multiple tenants concurrently within the platform. Multi-tenant support is essential for efficient resource utilization in cloud environments but can also improve application performance and overall user experience in embedded environments.

Previous work in this area has demonstrated the potential for significant energy and performance improvements, but largely consists of ad hoc techniques that have been applied to a small number of applications. Taking approximate computing closer to mainstream adoption requires (i) a deeper understanding of inherent application resilience across a broader range of applications (ii) tools that can quantitatively establish the inherent resilience of an application, and (iii) methods to quickly assess the potential of various approximate computing techniques for a given application. We make two key contributions in this direction. Our primary contribution is the analysis and characterization of inherent application resilience present in a suite of 12 widely used applications from the domains of recognition, data mining, and search. Based on this analysis, we present several new insights into the nature of resilience and its relationship to various key application characteristics. To facilitate our analysis, we propose a systematic framework for Application Resilience Characterization (ARC) that (a) partitions an application into resilient and sensitive parts and (b) characterizes the resilient parts using approximation models that abstract a wide range of approximate computing techniques. We believe that the key insights that we present can help shape further research in the area of approximate computing, while automatic resilience characterization frameworks such as ARC can greatly aid designers in the adoption approximate computing.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560706","Approximate Computing;Inherent Application Resilience;Resilience Characterization","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Hardware;Kernel;Measurement;Resilience","data mining;hardware-software codesign","ARC;application resilience characterization;approximate computing;data mining;design paradigm;inherent application resilience","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Formal verification of distributed controllers using Time-Stamped Event Count Automata","Kauer, M.; Steinhorst, S.; Goswami, D.; Schneider, R.; Lukasiewycz, M.; Chakraborty, S.","TUM CREATE, Singapore, Singapore","Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC), 2013 18th Asia and South Pacific","20130427","2013","","","411","416","We study distributed controllers where sensor, controller, and actuator tasks are mapped onto different processors or Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in a distributed automotive architecture, communicating via a shared bus. Controllers in such setups are designed with a sampling period equal to the worst-case sensor-to-actuator message delay. However, this assumption of all messages having to meet their deadlines is too pessimistic. The inherent robustness of most controllers allows some of the messages to miss their deadlines, while still meeting specified control performance constraints. Given a controller, in this paper we first quantify the frequency of its acceptable deadline misses and represent this as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. Further, we model the distributed architecture as a network of Time-Stamped Event Count Automata (TS-ECAs). Such a network of TS-ECAs is then model-checked to verify whether it satisfies the LTL formula. The verification ensures that the controller may be mapped onto the architecture and the control performance constraints will be satisfied. We have implemented this methodology in Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL), which is a well-known framework combining different tools for system verification. Our implementation and case studies using standard controller design shows the applicability of our proposed controller/architecture co-verification. It represents a significant improvement in current design flows where, although controller models are formally verified, their implementation on a distributed architecture is done in an ad hoc fashion with extensive testing and integration effort.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509631","","Actuators;Automata;Computer architecture;Control theory;Delays;Feedback control;Stability","actuators;automata theory;automotive engineering;distributed control;formal verification;temporal logic","ECU;LTL formula;SAL;TS-ECA;actuator task;control performance constraint;controller design;controller-architecture coverification;design flow;distributed architecture;distributed automotive architecture;distributed controller;electronic control unit;formal verification;linear temporal logic formula;model checking;processor;sensor-to-actuator message delay;shared bus;symbolic analysis laboratory;system verification;time-stamped event count automata","","4","","15","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, frequent switching of micro-valves results in decreased reliability. To minimize the valve-switching activities, we develop a network-flow based resource binding algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS) and minimum cost maximum flow (MCMF) in architectural-level synthesis.

The VS model is used to fully characterize a standard cell library with timing comparisons showing less than 2.7% error with respect to the industrial design kit. Furthermore, a 1001-stage inverter chain and a 32-bit ripple-carry adder are employed as test cases in a vendor CAD environment to validate the use of the VS model for large-scale digital circuit applications.

BTI exponentially varies by temperature and the actual supply voltage seen by the transistors within the chip which are functions of leakage power. Leakage power is strongly impacted by PVT and BTI which in turn results in thermal-voltage variations. Hence, neglecting one or some of these aspects can lead to a considerable inaccuracy in the estimated BTI-induced delay degradation. However, a holistic approach to tackle all these issues and their interdependence is missing. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to predict the probability density function and covariance of temperatures and voltage droops of a die in the presence of the BTI and process variation. Based on this model, we propose a statistical method that characterizes the life-time of the circuit affected by BTI in the presence of process-induced temperature-voltage variations. We observe that for benchmark circuits, treating each aspect independently and ignoring their intrinsic interactions results in 16% over-design, translating to unnecessary yield and performance loss.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509663","","Degradation;Delays;Equations;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Threshold voltage;Transistors","VLSI;probability;statistical analysis","BTI induced delay degradation;VLSI design;bias temperature instability;leakage power;nanoscale regime;probability density function;process induced voltage;process voltage temperature variations;statistical analysis;supply voltage;thermal voltage variation;transistor aging;unpredictability;voltage drops","","5","","24","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) is one of the most important metrics in real-time system design. While existing works only consider one of these two challenges at a time, in this paper, a compiler-level optimization, Joint WCET and Update Conscious Compilation (WUCC), is proposed to jointly consider WCET and code update for cyber-physical systems.

This paper makes a careful study on the challenges for SID-compliant detailed routing and proposes a graph model to capture the decomposition violations and SID intrinsic residue issues. Then a negotiated congestion based scheme is adopted to solve the overall routing problem. The proposed SID-compliant detailed routing algorithm simultaneously assigns colors to the routed wires, which provides valuable information guiding SID decomposition. In addition, if one pin has multiple candidate locations, the optimal one will be automatically determined during detailed routing.

A majority of existing PUFs rely on a dedicated circuit structure for generating chip-specific signatures, which often imposes concerns due to area/power overhead and extra design efforts. Furthermore, existing PUF-based signature generation cannot be employed to authenticate chips already in the market. In this paper, we propose RESP, a novel PUF structure realized in embedded SRAM array, a prevalent component in processors and system-on-chips (SOCs), with virtually no design modification. RESP leverages on voltage-depend memory access failures (during write) to produce large volume of high-quality challenge-response pairs.

To overcome the issue of limited cache space per task, we keep a portion of the cache unlocked and let all the tasks use it through time-multiplexing. Compared to locking the entire cache for each task during execution, our approach obviates the cost of reloading locked blocks at preemption. But we require static cache analysis for WCET estimation and cache related preemption delay (CRPD) analysis of the unlocked cache space.

This coprocessor can dynamically select the suitable pipeline stages for each baseband protocol.

This paper proposes to instrument the Android kernel in order to collect and report accurate subsystem activity values based on real-time profiling of the running applications. The activity information along with offline-constructed, regression-based power macro models for major subsystems in the smartphone yield the power dissipation estimate for the whole system. Next, while accounting for the rate-capacity effect in batteries, the total power dissipation data is translated into the battery's energy depletion rate, and subsequently, used to compute the battery's remaining lifetime based on its current state of charge information. Finally, this paper describes a novel application design framework, which considers the batterys state-of-charge (SOC), batterys energy depletion rate, and service quality of the target application.

In-vehicle networks might be very large and complex and hence obtaining a schedule for a fully synchronous system becomes a challenging task since all bus and processor constraints as well as end-to-end-timing constraints have to be taken concurrently into account. Existing optimization approaches apply the schedule optimization to the entire network, limiting their application due to scalability issues. In contrast, the presented framework obtains the schedule for the entire network, using a two-step approach where for each cluster a local schedule is obtained first and the local schedules are then merged to the global schedule. This approach is also in accordance with the design process in the automotive industry where different subsystems are developed independently to reduce the design complexity and are finally combined in the integration stage. In this paper, a generic framework for schedule integration of time-triggered systems is presented. Further, we show how this framework is implemented for a FlexRay network using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach which might also be easily adapted to other protocols.

The challenge is to quickly estimate the execution time and energy consumption of the system with distinct cache configurations using minimal number of slow full-system cycle-accurate simulations. To this end, we propose a novel, simple yet highly accurate execution time estimator and a simple, reasonably accurate energy estimator. Our framework, RExCache, combines a cycle-accurate simulator and a trace-driven cache simulator with our novel execution time estimator and energy estimator to avoid cycle-accurate simulations of all the last-level cache configurations. Once execution time and energy estimates are available from the estimators, RExCache chooses minimum execution time or minimum energy consumption cache configuration. Our experiments with nine different applications from mediabench, and 330 last-level cache configurations show that the execution time and energy estimators had at least average absolute accuracy of 99.74% and 80.31% respectively. RExCache took only a few hours (21 hours for H.264enc) to explore last-level cache configurations compared to several days of traditional method (36 days for H.264enc) and cycle-accurate simulations (257 days for H.264enc), enabling quick exploration of the last-level cache. When 100 different real-time constraints on execution time and energy were used, all the cache configurations found by RExCache were similar to those from cycle-accurate simulations. On the other hand, the traditional method found correct cache configurations for only 69 out of 100 constraints. Thus, RExCache has better absolute accuracy than the traditional method, yet reducing the simulation time by at least 97%.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509661","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Estimation;Memory management;Real-time systems;System-on-chip","cache storage","RExCache;cache configuration;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy estimator;execution time estimator;full-system cycle-accurate simulation;trace-driven cache simulator;unified last-level cache","","2","","27","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although there are many tools for multi-mode circuit implementation, to our knowledge there is no available systematic analysis or methodology for the selection of associated signoff modes. We observe that the selection of signoff modes has significant impact on circuit area, power and performance. For example, incorrect choice of signoff voltages for required overdrive frequencies can result in a netlist with 15% suboptimality in power or 21% in area. In this paper, we propose a concept of mode dominance which can be used as a guideline for signoff mode selection. Further, we also propose efficient circuit implementation flows to optimize the selection of signoff modes within several distinct use cases. Our results show that our proposed methodology provides 5-7% improvement in performance compared to the traditional “signoff and scale” method. The signoff modes determined by our methods result in only 0.6% overhead in performance and 8% overhead in power after implementation, compared to the optimal signoff modes.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509619","","Approximation methods;Optimization;Power demand;Search problems;Threshold voltage;Timing;Voltage control","optimisation;power aware computing;system-on-chip","SOC implementations;circuit performance;multimode circuit implementation;optimization;overdrive signoff;power across voltage-scaling","","2","","17","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multi-mode pipelined MPSoC, used as a streaming accelerator, executes multiple, mutually exclusive applications through modes where each mode refers to the execution of one application. We model each application as a directed graph. The challenge is to merge application graphs into a single graph so that the multi-mode pipelined MPSoC derived from the merged graph contains minimal resources. We solve this problem by finding maximal overlap between application graphs. Three heuristics are proposed where two of them greedily merge application graphs while the third one finds an optimal merging at the cost of higher running time. The results indicate significant area saving (up to 62% processor area, 57% FIFO area and 44 processor/FIFO ports) with minuscule degradation of system throughput (up to 2%) and latency (up to 2%) and increase in energy values (up to 3%) when compared to widely used approach of designing distinct pipelined MPSoCs for individual applications.

In the bus planning problem, we need to simultaneously solve the bus decomposition, escape routing, layer assignment and global bus routing. This problem was partially addressed by Kong et al. in [3] where they only focused on the layer assignment and global bus routing, assuming bus decomposition and escape routing are given. In this paper, we present an ILP-based solution to the entire bus planning problem. We apply our bus planner to an industrial PCB (with over 7000 nets and 12 signal layers) which was previously successfully routed manually, and compare with a state-of-the-art industrial internal tool where the layer assignment and global bus routing are based on the algorithm in [3]. Our bus planner successfully routed 97.4% of all the nets.

"Exploiting just-enough parallelism when mapping streaming applications in hard real-time systems","Zhai, J.T.; Bamakhrama, M.A.; Stefanov, T.","Leiden Inst. of Adv. Comput.

It has been shown that the various forms of parallelism in an application should be explored to achieve the maximum system performance. However, if more parallelism is revealed than needed, it will overload the underlying MPSoC platform. At the same time, the revealed parallelism should be sufficient such that the MPSoC platform is fully utilized. Therefore, the amount of revealed and exploited parallelism has to be just-enough with respect to the platform constraints. In this paper, we study the problem of exploiting just-enough parallelism by application task unfolding, when mapping streaming applications modeled using the Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) MoC onto MPSoC platforms in hard real-time systems. We show that our problem of simultaneously unfolding and allocating tasks under hard real-time scheduling has a bounded solution space and derive its upper bounds. Subsequently, we devise an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, while the obtained solution meets a pre-specified quality. The experiments on a set of real-life streaming applications demonstrate that our algorithm results, within reasonable amount of time, in a system specification with large performance gain. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm is on average 100 times faster than one of the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, i.e., NSGA-II genetic algorithm, while achieving the same quality of solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560763","","Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Parallel processing;Real-time systems;Resource management;Upper bound;Vectors","data flow graphs;embedded systems;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","MPSoC;embedded streaming applications;exploiting just-enough parallelism;hard real-time systems;multiprocessor system-on-chip;parallel models of computation;real-life streaming applications;streaming application mapping;synchronous data flow;tasks allocation","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, drivers developed over virtual prototypes often do not work readily on silicon devices, since silicon devices often do not conform to virtual prototypes. Therefore, it is important to detect the inconsistences between silicon devices and virtual prototypes. We present an approach to post-silicon conformance checking of a hardware device with its virtual prototype, i.e., a virtual device. The conformance between the silicon and virtual devices is defined over their interface states. This approach symbolically executes the virtual device with the same driver request sequence to the silicon device, and checks if the interface states of the silicon and virtual devices are consistent. Inconsistencies detected indicate potential errors in either the silicon device or the virtual device. We have evaluated our approach on three network adapters and their virtual devices, and found 15 inconsistencies exposing 15 real bugs in total from the silicon and virtual devices. The results demonstrate that our approach is useful and efficient in facilitating device/driver covalidation at the post-silicon stage.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560622","Post-silicon validation;conformance checking;virtual prototypes","Computer bugs;Hardware;Interface states;Prototypes;Registers;Silicon;Silicon devices","time to market;virtual prototyping","device/driver codevelopment;device/driver covalidation;post-silicon conformance checking;time-to-market;virtual prototypes","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, LEQA, which is based on computing the neighborhood population counts of qubits, can produce estimates of the circuit latency with good accuracy (i.e., an average of less than 3% error) with up to two orders of magnitude speedup for mid-size benchmarks.

A flash cell is likely to wear out after undergoing excessive program/erase (P/E) flips. Wear leveling is hence employed to spread erase operations as evenly as possible. It is traditionally conducted by the flash translation layer (FTL), a management firmware residing in Hash devices. In this paper, we shall propose a novel wear leveling algorithm involving the operating system (OS). We will show that our operating System-Assisted Wear leveling (SAW) algorithm can significantly improve the wear evenness. SAW takes advantage of OS's knowledge about files at a higher level of abstraction, and provides useful hints to the lower-level FTL to accommodate data. A prototype based on a file system and an FTL has been developed to verify the effectiveness of SAW. Experiments show that wear evenness can be improved by as much as 85.0% compared to the state-of-the-art FTL wear leveling schemes.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560757","","Ash;Mathematical model;OWL;Prototypes;Resource management;Surface acoustic waves;Temperature distribution","NAND circuits;electronic engineering computing;firmware;flash memories;integrated circuit reliability;operating systems (computers)","NAND flash memory write endurance;OS;P-E flips;SAW leveling algorithm;file system;flash cell;flash translation layer;lower-level FTL wear leveling schemes;management firmware;operating system;program-erase flips;system-assisted wear leveling algorithm","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has promoted the use of multi-core, multiprocessor, and distributed platforms. Such systems usually require run-time migration of distributed applications between the different nodes of the platform in order to balance the workload or to tolerate faults. Before an application can be migrated, it needs to be brought to a stable state such that restarting the application after migration does not violate its functional correctness. An application in a stable state does not change its context any further, and therefore, stabilization is a prerequisite for any application migration. Process networks are a common model of computation for specifying distributed applications. However, most results on the migration of process networks do not provide an algorithm to put a general process network into a stable state, suitable for migration. This paper proposes a technique which efficiently and correctly brings a process network executing on a distributed system to a known stable state. The correctness of the technique is independent of the temporal characteristics of the system and the topology of the process network. The required modifications of a process network are lightweight and preserve its original functionality. A model characterizing the timing properties of the technique is provided. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach and the respective model are validated with experimental results on Intel's SCC platform.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560760","","Context;Earth Observing System;Ports (Computers);Tiles;Timing;Upper bound","embedded systems;microprocessor chips","Intel SCC;distributed platforms;distributed stable states;distributed system;embedded systems;general process network;multicore platforms;multiprocessor platforms;process networks;technology scaling","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their actual benefits are not yet clearly verified while the energy efficiency can be improved in many ways. The carbon emission benefits from EV is largely diminished if we charge EV with electricity from petroleum power plants due to power loss during generation, transmission, conversion and charging. On the other hand, regenerative braking is direct power conversion from the wheel to battery and one of the most important processes that can enhance energy efficiency of EV. Power loss during regenerative braking can be reduced by hybrid energy storage system (HESS) such that super-capacitors accept high power as batteries have small rate capability. Conventional charge management does not systematically exchange charge between the supercapacitor and battery. However, asymmetry in acceleration and deceleration as well as battery charging and discharging capability make the supercapacitor state of charge (SoC) management override the efficiency optimization. Unlike previous works, we show how charge migration during idle and cruise/stopping time can be beneficial in terms of energy efficiency and cruise range. Systematic charge migration decouples SoC management and charging efficiency optimization giving a higher degree of freedom to charging efficiency optimization. We demonstrate the proposed charge migration between the supercapacitor and battery improves energy efficiency by 19.4%.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560690","Battery-supercapacitor hybrid;Charging/discharging asymmetry;Electric vehicle;Regenerative braking","Acceleration;Batteries;DC motors;Force;Supercapacitors;System-on-chip;Vehicles","battery management systems;electric vehicles;energy storage;regenerative braking;supercapacitors","battery charging;battery discharging;battery management;carbon emission;electric vehicles;energy efficiency;hybrid energy storage systems;internal combustion engine vehicles;petroleum power plants;power conversion;power loss;regenerative braking;state of charge management;super-capacitors","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, the max or min of a set of Gaussians is performed iteratively in a pair-wise fashion, wherein the result of each pair-wise max or min operation is approximated to a Gaussian by matching moments of the true result obtained using Clark's approach [1]. The approximation error in the final result is thus a function of the order in which the pairwise operations are performed. In this paper, we analyze known “run-time expensive” ordering techniques that attempt to reduce this error in the context of SSTA and SSTA driven optimization. We propose new techniques to speeding up the computation of the max/min of a set of Gaussians by special handling of prevalent “zero error” cases. Two new methods are presented using these techniques that provide more than 60% run-time savings (3X speed-up) in max/min operations. This translates to an overall run-time improvement of 2-17% for a single SSTA run and an improvement of up to 8 hours (55%) in an SSTA driven optimization run.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560775","Statistical timing;variability","Approximation error;Context;Gaussian distribution;Indexes;Optimization;Timing","Gaussian processes;approximation theory;error analysis;iterative methods;minimax techniques;statistical analysis;timing","Clark approach;Gaussian random variable;SSTA driven optimization;approximation error analysis;iterative method;moment matching;pair-wise max operation;pair-wise min operation;pairwise operation;prevalent zero error handling;run-time expensive ordering technique;statistical static timing analysis","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NumChecker detects malicious modifications to a system call in the guest VM by checking the number of certain hardware events that occur during the system call's execution. To automatically count these events, NumChecker leverages the Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), which exist in most modern processors. By using HPCs, the checking cost is significantly reduced and the tamper-resistance is enhanced. We implement a prototype of NumChecker on Linux with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

"Efficient moment estimation with extremely small sample size via bayesian inference for analog/mixed-signal validation","Chenjie Gu; Chiprout, E.; Xin Li","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2013 50th ACM / EDAC / IEEE","20130718","2013","","","1","7","A critical problem in pre-Silicon and post-Silicon validation of analog/mixed-signal circuits is to estimate the distribution of circuit performances, from which the probability of failure and parametric yield can be estimated at all circuit configurations and corners. With extremely small sample size, traditional estimators are only capable of achieving a very low confidence level, leading to either over-validation or under-validation. In this paper, we propose a multi-population moment estimation method that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small sample size. In fact, the proposed estimator is theoretically guaranteed to outperform usual moment estimators. The key idea is to exploit the fact that simulation and measurement data collected under different circuit configurations and corners can be correlated, and are conditionally independent. We exploit such correlation among different populations by employing a Bayesian framework, i.e., by learning a prior distribution and applying maximum a posteriori estimation using the prior. We apply the proposed method to several datasets including post-silicon measurements of a commercial highspeed I/O link, and demonstrate an average error reduction of up to 2×, which can be equivalently translated to significant reduction of validation time and cost.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560658","","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Estimation;Nickel;Sociology;Standards;Statistics","belief networks;electric moments;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;probability","Bayesian inference;analog/mixed-signal validation;moment estimation;post-silicon validation;pre-silicon validation;probability;validation time","","2","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work overcomes both limitations. For a single wire, our probabilistic analysis encapsulates known realities about CuDD wires, e.g., that some regions of these wires are more susceptible to EM than others, and that void formation/growth show statistical behavior.

The well known double-error-correcting BCH codes and the classical decoding method for BCH codes based on Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and Chien search cannot be directly adopted to replace SEC-DED codes because of their much larger decoding latency. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical double-error-correcting (HDEC) code. The construction methods and the decoder architecture for the codes are described. The presented error correcting algorithm takes only 1 clock cycle to finish if no error or a single-bit error occurs. When there are multi-bit errors, the decoding latency is O(log<sub>2</sub>m) clock cycles for codes defined over GF(2<sup>m</sup>). This is much smaller than the latency for decoding BCH codes using Berlekamp Massey algorithm and Chien search, which is O(k) clock cycles - k is the number of information bits for the code and m ~ O(log<sub>2</sub>k). Synthesis results show that the proposed (79, 64) HDEC code requires only 80% of the area and consumes <; 70% of the power compared to the classical (78, 64) BCH code. For a large bit distortion rate (10<sup>-3</sup> ~ 10<sup>-2</sup>), the average decoding latency for the (79, 64) HDEC code is only 36% ~ 60% of the latency for decoding the (78, 64) BCH code.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560696","","Clocks;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Decoding;Parity check codes;Polynomials;Power demand","BCH codes;decoding;error correction codes;integrated memory circuits;transients","BCH codes;Berlekamp-Massey algorithm;Chien search;HDEC;SEC-DED;bit distortion rate;decoding latency;hierarchical decoding;hierarchical double-error-correcting code;high speed reliable memories;multibit error rate;single error correcting double error correcting codes;transient errors","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior work uses strict network isolation to fulfill performance isolation. However, strict network isolation either results in low consolidation density, or complex routing mechanisms which indicates prohibitive high hardware cost and large latency. In view of this limitation, we propose a novel NoC isolation strategy for many-core cloud processors, called relaxed isolation (RISO). It permits underutilized links to be shared by multiple applications, at the same time keeps the aggregated traffic in check to enforce performance isolation. The experimental results show that the consolidation density is improved more than 12% in comparison with previous strict isolation scheme, meanwhile reducing network latency by 38.4% on average.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560631","Cloud Computing;Cloud Processors;Networks-on-Chip;Performance Isolation;Relaxed Isolation;Workload Consolidation","Network topology;Program processors;Routing;Shape;System-on-chip;Topology;Vectors","cloud computing;electronic engineering computing;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC isolation strategy;RISO;aggregated traffic;cloud service providers;complex routing mechanisms;low consolidation density;many-core cloud processors;many-core resources;relaxed network-on-chip isolation;scale-out workloads;system utilization optimization;workload consolidation technique","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper for first time proposes a fast framework called XDRA, which allows the exploration of last-level cache configurations to improve DDR-DRAM energy efficiency. XDRA combines a processor-memory simulator, a cache simulator and novel analysis techniques to produce a Kriging based estimator which predicts the energy savings for differing cache configurations for a given main memory size and application. Errors for the estimator were less than 4.4% on average for 11 applications from mediabench and SPEC2000 suite and two DRAM sizes (Micron DDR3-DRAM 256MB and 4GB). Cache configurations selected by XDRA were on average 3.6× and 4× more energy efficient (cache and DRAM energy) than a common cache configuration. Optimal cache configurations were selected by XDRA 20 times out of 22. The two suboptimal configurations were at most 3.9% from their optimal counterparts.

Although the power-efficiency of CGRAs can be very high, their performance critically hinges upon the capabilities of the compiler. This is because a CGRA compiler has to perform explicit pipelining, scheduling, placement, and routing of operations. Existing CGRA compilers struggle with two main problems: 1) effectively utilizing the local register files in the PEs, and 2) high compilation times. This paper significantly improves the state-of-the-art in CGRA compilers by first creating a precise and general formulation of the problem of loop mapping on CGRAs, considering the local registers, and from the insights gained from the problem formulation, distilling an efficient and constructive heuristic solution. We show that the mapping problem, once characterized, can be reduced to the problem of finding maximal weighted clique in the product graph of the time-extended CGRA and the data dependence graph of the kernel. The heuristic we've developed results in average of 1.89 X better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when applied to several kernels from multimedia and SPEC2006 benchmarks. A unique feature of our heuristic is that it learns from failed attempts and constructively changes the schedule to achieve better mappings at lower compilation times.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560611","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Kernel;Registers;Resource management;Routing;Schedules","","","","3","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the computing power budget, we devise an optimal computing budgeting technique based on knapsack-solving algorithms to determine the power caps for the individual servers.

Two types of flash memory cells are available for building SSD caches, single-level cells (SLC) and multi-level cells (MLC). MLC is more appealing than SLC because it can achieve higher cache capacity at the same cost. However, we see a critical issue for SSD caches to adopt MLC NAND flash: the endurance of modern MLC NAND flash is too low to sustain datacenter workloads. In this paper, we propose DuraCache that addresses the durability issue of SSD caches. DuraCache exploits the fact that SSD caches are write-through caches in datacenters. Therefore, uncorrectable errors in SSD caches can be handled like cache misses which bring in correct data from HDD arrays. In addition, DuraCache gradually allocates more ECC parities associated with data when NAND flash reaches wearout thresholds. This allows SSD caches to continue operating by sacrificing available capacity. We conduct empirical experiments and demonstrate that DuraCache enables MLC SSD caches to achieve 4.1 years of service life assuming a TPC-C workload.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560759","Cache;Endurance;MLC;NAND flash;SSD","Arrays;Bit error rate;Error correction;Error correction codes;Flash memories;Reliability;Servers","NAND circuits;cache storage;flash memories","DuraCache;HDD arrays;MLC NAND flash;SLC;SSD cache;single-level cells","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution is an entirely software technique based on static workload characterization and online execution with NBTI monitoring that equalizes the expected lifetime of each processing element by regenerating aging-aware healthy kernels that respond to the specific health state of GPGPU. We demonstrate our approach on AMD Evergreen architecture where iso-throughput executions of the healthy kernels reduce NBTI-induced voltage threshold shift up to 49% (11%) compared to naïve kernel executions, with (without) architectural support for power-gating.

For this reason, test engineers are often reluctant to adopt alternative tests since it is not guaranteed that test cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of sacrificing test quality. In this paper, we present a technique to estimate the parametric test error fast and reliably with parts per million accuracy. The technique is based on extreme value theory and statistical blockade. Relying on a small number of targeted simulations, it is capable of providing accurate estimates of parametric test error in the general scenario where a set of alternative tests replaces all or a subset of standard specification tests.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560665","Analog/mixed-signal/RF IC testing;extreme value theory;statistical blockade;test metrics","Integrated circuit modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation;Measurement;Monte Carlo methods;Standards;Testing","analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit testing;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;radiofrequency integrated circuits;statistical analysis","RF circuit;extreme value theory;mixed signal circuit;multidimensional analog test metrics estimation;parametric test error;statistical blockade","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thermal behavior of complicated systems like packaged electronic systems may exhibit nonlinear and temperature dependent properties. As a result, it is difficult to use a low order linear model to approximate the thermal behavior of the packaged integrated systems without accuracy loss. In this paper, we try to mitigate this problem by using piecewise linear (PWL) approach to characterizing the thermal behavior of those systems. The new method (called ThermSubPWL), which is the first proposed approach to nonlinear thermal modeling problem, identifies the linear local models for different temperature ranges using the subspace identification method. A linear transformation method is proposed to transform all the identified linear local models to the common state basis to build the continuous piecewise linear model. Experimental results validate the proposed method on a realistic packaged integrated system modeled via the multi-domain/physics commercial tool, COMSOL, under practical power signal inputs. The new piecewise models can lead to much smaller model order without accuracy loss, which translates to significant savings in both the simulation time and the time required to identify the reduced models compared to applying the high order models.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509589","","Accuracy;Data models;Electronic packaging thermal management;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Power grids;Temperature distribution","integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit packaging;piecewise linear techniques;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging)","COMSOL;ThermSubPWL method;compact nonlinear thermal modeling;continuous piecewise linear model;linear local model;linear transformation method;packaged electronic systems;packaged integrated systems;piecewise linear method;practical power signal input;subspace identification method;thermal behavior;thermal nonlinear modeling technique","","2","","16","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WCRT is determined by the mapping of the tasks to the cores (which determines load balancing) and the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) of the tasks. However, the WCET of a task is also influenced by the conflicts in the shared cache from concurrently executing tasks on other cores in a multi-core system. In other words, the mapping of the tasks to the cores indirectly influences the WCET of the tasks, which in turn impacts the WCRT of the entire application. Thus the mapping of the tasks to the cores should simultaneously maximize workload balance and minimize shared cache interference. We propose an integer-linear programming (ILP) formulation to achieve this objective. Experimental evaluation shows that shared cache aware task mapping achieves on an average 25% and 33% WCRT reduction for real-life and synthetic applications, respectively, compared to traditional approach that is agnostic to shared cache conflicts and solely focuses on load balancing.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509688","","Abstracts;Computational modeling;Estimation;Interference;Mathematical model;Multicore processing","cache storage;concurrency control;embedded systems;integer programming;linear programming;multiprocessing systems;multiprogramming;processor scheduling","ILP formulation;WCRT minimization;concurrently executing task;integer-linear programming;load balancing;multicore system;multitasking application;real-time embedded system;shared cache aware task mapping;shared cache conflict;shared cache interference minimization;workload balance;worst-case response time","","0","","23","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of intuitively assigning the heavy tasks to the low temperature cores to balance the thermal profile based on steady state thermal analysis, the proposed method applies moment matching based transient thermal analysis techniques for fast thermal estimation and prediction to guide the migration process. We show that by considering the dominant temperature moment component, the resulting algorithm can lead to significant reduction of hot spots without full transient thermal simulation.

This paper addresses this new research problem of how to perform L-shaped fracturing with sliver minimization. We propose two novel algorithms.

As most embedded systems are application-oriented, we can better utilize PCM by exploring application-specific features such as fixed access patterns and update frequencies to prolong the lifetime of PCM. In this paper, we propose an application-specific wear leveling technique, called Curling-PCM, to evenly distribute write activities across the PCM chip in order to improve the endurance of PCM. The basic idea is to exploit application-specific features in embedded systems and periodically move the hot region across the whole PCM chip. To further reduce the overhead of moving the hot region and improve the performance of PCM-based embedded systems, a fine-grained partial wear leveling policy is proposed in Curling-PCM, by which only part of the hot region is moved during each request handling period. The experimental results show that Curling-PCM can effectively evenly distribute write traffic in PCM chips compared with previous work.

A digital mockup is an executable model of a physical system and used for real-time test and validation of cyber-physical devices that interact with the physical system. These digital mockups are typically defined in terms of a large set of ordinary differential equations. We consider digital mockups impelemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A checkpoint is a snapshot of the internal state of the model at a specific point in time as captured by some controller that resides on the same FPGA. We require that the model continues uninterrupted execution during a checkpointing operation. Once a checkpoint is created, the corresponding state information is transferred from the FPGA to a host computer for visualization and other off-chip processing. We outline the architecture of a checkpointing controller that captures and transfers the state information at a desired clock cycle using an aggressive compression technique. Our compression technique achieves 90% reduction in data transferred from the FPGA to the host computer under periodic checkpointing scenarios. The checkpointing with compression yields 15-36% FPGA size overhead, versus 6-11% for checkpointing without compression.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509669","","Checkpointing;Computational modeling;Data models;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Lungs;Random access memory","checkpointing;data compression;differential equations;field programmable gate arrays;real-time systems","FPGA size;FPGA-based digital mockups;aggressive compression technique;checkpointing controller;cyber-physical devices;data transfer;field-programmable gate arrays;host computer;nonintrusive checkpointing mechanism;off-chip processing;ordinary differential equations;physical system;real-time test;state information;uninterrupted execution","","0","","15","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For efficient execution, the flow of liquid routes in microfluidic biochips needs to be scheduled under some resource constraints or routing constraints.

APF records the prefetch-victim address pairs of issued prefetches and collects information about which address in each pair is first accessed by the processor to guide the filtering of new generated useless prefetches. Meanwhile, filtered prefetches are recorded for building the feedback mechanism to avoid filtering useful prefetches. Experimental results demonstrate that APF reduces useless prefetches by an average of 53.81% with a mere 5.28% reduction of useful prefetches, thus reducing the memory access bandwidth consumption by 59.92% and the L2 cache energy by 6.19%.

This TSV behavior can be simulated using analytical methods, 2D electrostatic simulators, or 3D full-wave electromagnetic simulators.

These brute-force like approaches can take years to complete. Alternatively, application's memory access trace driven crude estimation methods can find a cache hierarchy quickly by compromising the accuracy of results. In this article, for the first time, we propose a fast and accurate application's trace driven approach to find the optimal real-time application specific two-level inclusive data cache hierarchy.

Our approach dynamically allocates and relocates memory blocks between the 3D-DRAM and the ex-DRAM to exploit the high memory bandwidth and the low memory latency of the 3D-DRAM as well as the high capacity and the low cost of the ex-DRAM. Our simulation shows that in workloads that are not memory intensive, our memory management technique transfers all active memory blocks to the 3D-DRAM which runs faster than the ex-DRAM. In memory intensive workloads, our memory management technique utilizes both the 3D-DRAM and the ex-DRAM to increase the memory bandwidth to alleviate bandwidth congestion. Our approach supports Quality of Service (QoS) for “latency sensitive”, “bandwidth sensitive”, and “insensitive” applications. To improve the performance and satisfy a certain level of QoS, memory blocks of different application types are allocated differently. Compared to the scratchpad memory management mechanism, the average memory access latency of our approach decreases by 19% and 23%, while performance improves by up to 5% and 12% in single threaded benchmarks and multi-threaded benchmarks respectively.

The global distribution stage aims to obtain better wirelength while distributing modules over a fixed outline. Once a good result can be obtained in the first stage, the legalization stage only needs to obtain a feasible solution by maintaining the good result. The legalization is performed by curve merging in a slicing tree, which is obtained by the partition based approach. Two functions are proposed to divide a circuit and the associated placement region into two parts. Although the fixed-outline floorplanning with mixed size modules is very difficult, our method still can obtain better results.

As on-chip communication reliability is a crucial factor in many-core systems, the NoC paradigm should address the reliability issues. Using fault-tolerant routing algorithms to reroute packets around faulty regions will increase the packet latency and create congestion around the faulty region. On the other hand, the performance of NoC is highly affected by the network congestion. Congestion in the network can increase the delay of packets to route from a source to a destination, so it should be avoided. In this paper, a minimal and defect-resilient (MD) routing algorithm is proposed in order to route packets adaptively through the shortest paths in the presence of a faulty link, as long as a path exists. To avoid congestion, output channels can be adaptively chosen whenever the distance from the current to destination node is greater than one hop along both directions. In addition, an analytical model is presented to evaluate MD for two-faulty cases.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509555","","Artificial neural networks;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Heuristic algorithms;Routing;System recovery;System-on-chip","embedded systems;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC;defect-resilient routing algorithm;fault-tolerant routing algorithm;faulty link;many-core embedded system;many-core system;minimal path-based fault-tolerant routing;minimal routing algorithm;network congestion;network-on-chip;on-chip communication reliability;on-chip network;packet latency;packet rerouting","","9","","23","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the capacity increase of NAND flash, it becomes vitally important to reduce the RAM print of the address mapping table while not introducing big performance overhead. Demand-based address mapping is an effective approach to solve this problem, in which the address mapping table is stored in NAND flash (called translation pages), and mapping items are cached on-demand in RAM. Therefore, it is critical to manage translation pages in demand-based address mapping. This paper solves two most important problems in translation page management. First, to reduce frequent translation page updates caused by data requests, we propose a page-level caching mechanism to exploit the fundamental property of NAND flash where the basic read/write unit is one page. Second, to reduce the garbage collection overhead from translation pages, we propose a multiple write pointers strategy to group data pages corresponding to the same translation page into one data block, by which, when the data block is reclaimed via the garbage collection, we only need to update one translation page. We evaluate our scheme using a set of benchmarks from both real-world and synthetic traces. Experimental results show that our techniques can achieve significant reduction in the extra translation operations and improve the system response time.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509616","","Ash;Indexes;Information management;Measurement;Memory management;Random access memory;Time factors","flash memories;optimisation;random-access storage","NAND flash memory storage systems;RAM print;demand-based address mapping;extra translation operations;on-demand;translation information management","","0","","19","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach in generating random bits with required probabilities is to synthesize combinational circuits that transform a set of source probabilities into target probabilities. In [1], the authors proposed a greedy algorithm that synthesizes circuits in the form of a gate chain to approximate target probabilities. However, since this approach only considers circuits of such a special form, the resulting circuits are not satisfactory both in terms of the approximation error and the circuit depth. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to synthesize combinational circuits for generating random bits. Compared to the previous one, our approach greatly enlarges the search space. Also, we apply a linear property of probabilistic logic computation and an iterative local search method to increase the efficiency of our algorithm. Experimental results comparing the approximation errors and the depths of the circuits synthesized by our method to those of the circuits synthesized by the previous approach demonstrate the superiority of our method.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509586","","Approximation algorithms;Combinational circuits;Equations;Inverters;Iterative methods;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic","approximation theory;combinational circuits;iterative methods;probability;random processes","approximation error;circuit depth;greedy algorithm;iterative local search method;linear property;multilevel combinational circuit;probabilistic logic computation;random bits;source probability;target probability","","0","","14","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the diverse working sets in irregular applications make the cache contention issue an even more serious problem. As a result, taking cache capacity into account has become a critical scheduling issue of GPGPUs. This paper formulates a Cache Capacity Aware Thread Scheduling Problem to capture the impact of cache capacity as well as different architectural considerations. With a proof to be NP-hard, this paper has proposed two algorithms to perform the cache capacity aware thread scheduling. The simulation results on Nvidia's Fermi configuration have shown that the proposed scheduling scheme can effectively avoid cache contention, and achieve an average of 44.7% cache miss reduction and 28.5% runtime enhancement.

The experimental results showed 80X+ speedup compared to the general LP formulation. Considering the resource usage, we propose a two-stage heuristic Network Simplex Method based Power-efficient Multiple Voltage Scheduling(NPMVS) method. Firstly, the above relaxed LP formulation is modified to perform mobility allocation and delay assignment for the operations so as to minimize the power and the differences between the allocated operation mobilities and the predefined target mobilities. The modified formulation is solved using the PLNSM and iteratively performed to minimize power and resource density variation in control steps by gradually updating the predefined target mobilities. Secondly, with the allocated operation mobilities, we apply dependency-free operation scheduling with the objective of minimizing the resource usage.

This is assumed to reduce off-chip main memory access latencies by roughly 45% to 60%. Our detailed circuit-level models, however, demonstrate that this latency reduction from the TSVs is significantly less. In this paper, we present these models, compare 2D and 3D main memory latencies, and show that the reduction in latency from using 3D main memory to be no more than 2.4 ns. We also show that although the wider I/O bus width enabled by using TSVs increases performance, it may do so with an increase in power consumption. Although TSVs consume less power per bit transfer than off-chip metal interconnects (11.2 times less power per bit transfer), TSVs typically use considerably more bits and may result in a net increase in power due to the large number of bits in the memory I/O bus. Our analysis shows that although a 3D memory hierarchy exploiting a wider memory bus can increase performance, this performance increase may not justify the net increase in power consumption.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509675","","Benchmark testing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Memory management;Random access memory;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","DRAM chips;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D stacked memories;computer architectures;latency claims;power consumption;through-silicon vias","","2","","25","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, a through silicon via is modeled with inductive and capacitive parasitic elements and appended to the PDN. Therefore, the circuit related to the 3-D IC technology tends to be a tightly coupled large network. For the simulation of this type of network, an explicit time marching scheme has an advantage over conventional general-purpose circuit simulators such as SPICE in the computational cost. However, the explicit method has a strict numerical stability condition, which may limit the maximum time step size and increase the total amount of the cost. In this work, we propose the method which is explicit, but stable with no stability condition. Additionally, the proposed unconditionally-stable explicit method is accelerated more by combining with an order reduction technique.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509550","","Capacitance;Computational modeling;Equivalent circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Iron;Silicon;Through-silicon vias","SPICE;circuit simulation;distribution networks;equivalent circuits;numerical stability;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC technology;3D grid structure;PDN;SPICE;capacitive parasitic elements;computational cost;conventional general-purpose circuit simulators;equipotential conductors;equivalent circuit;explicit time marching scheme;fast 3D simulation;ground lines;inductive parasitic elements;numerical stability condition;on-chip power distribution network;order reduction technique;power lines;through silicon via;tightly coupled large network;unconditionally stable explicit method;unconditionally-stable explicit method;vertical couplings","","0","","19","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 13 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, including USA, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea, Italy, and Taiwan. Continuing its great success in 2012, 2013 CAD contest attracts 87 teams from 9 regions, including USA, Canada, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, achieving 55% growth. Three contest problems on technology mapping, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Hwei-Tseng Wang of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on technology mapping for macro blocks. The implementation of a digital function is more flexible and powerful as technology advances. Therefore, how to fully utilize and reuse macro blocks in a highly optimized design becomes an important issue. However, it is challenging to identify the boundaries of macro blocks in such complex netlists. For the first problem, contestants are required to map and replace a given design by a set of macro blocks as much as possible. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on the placement finishing step, detailed placement and legalization. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. Although there are significant improvements on global placement techniques via recent placement contests, the need for high performance detailed placeme- t continues to grow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total wirelength, placement/pin density are optimized. Topic chair Shayak Banerjee of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. As technology advances, the printed feature size is smaller than the wavelength of the light shining through the mask. The subwavelength gap causes unwanted shape distortions. To compensate these distortions, mask optimization is performed. For the third problem, contestants are required to find the best mask solution for a given pixelated layout. The best mask solution means least EPE violations and minimum process variations over different corners measured by a provided lithography simulation model. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691128","Technology mapping;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Force;Integrated circuits;Iris;Lithography;Optimization","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;lithography","CAD contest;DAC contest;EDA domain;Hong Kong;IC design flow;ICCAD;IEEE CEDA;ISPD contest;Italy;Japan;Korea;Mainland China;Ministry of Education;TAU contest;Taiwan;USA;United States of America;circuit elements;computer aided design;detailed placement;electronic design automation;integrated circuit design flow;legalization;lithography mask optimization;lithography simulation model;macro blocks;mask optimization;placement finishing step;research and development","","0","","","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evaluations of such methods using benchmarks and academically known attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test the abilities of the FANCI prototype. In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups from multiple continents created designs with backdoors hidden in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are non-stealthy backdoors, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some areas where the FANCI prototype could be made more performant, which motivates further development of the prototype.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881502","backdoors;functional analysis;hardware;intellectual property;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Logic gates;Prototypes;Security;Testing;Wires","functional analysis;logic design","FANCI;blue team assessment;dynamic attack scenarios;frequent-action backdoors;functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification;functional analysis methods;hardware designs;malicious circuit identification;non-stealthy backdoors;red team assessment","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
