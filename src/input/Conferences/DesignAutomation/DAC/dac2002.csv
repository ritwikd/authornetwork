Maximizing battery life requires system designers to develop an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the batteries that power such systems, and to incorporate battery considerations into the system design process. Recent research has shown that the amount of energy that can be supplied by a given battery varies significantly, depending on how the energy is drawn. Consequently, researchers are attempting to develop new battery-driven approaches to system design, which deliver battery life improvements over and beyond what can be achieved through conventional low-power design techniques. This paper presents an introduction to this emerging area, surveys promising technologies that have been developed for battery modeling and battery-efficient system design, and outlines emerging industry standards for smart battery systems","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994932","","Batteries;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Integrated circuit technology;Internet;National electric code;Personal communication networks;Power system modeling;Standards development;Telephone sets","cells (electric);design engineering;low-power electronics;power supply circuits;scheduling","battery capabilities;battery considerations;battery life;battery life maximization;battery limitations;battery modeling;battery-driven system design;battery-driven system design approaches;battery-efficient system design;electronic systems;industry standards;low power design;low-power design techniques;primary design consideration;scheduling techniques;smart battery systems;supplied battery energy;system design;system design process","","115","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This tutorial aims at motivating the audience to consider asynchronous circuits as a competitive alternative to solve some of the design problems inherent to submicron technologies. One of the main reasons why designers are reluctant to incorporate asynchrony in their systems is the difficulty to design asynchronous circuits. Asynchronous circuits are promising to tackle problems such as electro-magnetic interference, power consumption, performance, and modularity of digital circuits. The tutorial will introduce state-of-the-art tools and methodologies for their design. It will cover aspects such as specification, architectural design and controller synthesis tools, of asynchronous circuits. The tutorial will concentrate on a particular design methodology for control circuits based on specifications with signal transition graphs.

Conventional CMOS technology will face difficulties in the sub-0.1 μm, sub-1 V region. Random-modulation CMOS, which assigns multiple threshold levels in the same block through the use of sophisticated CAD tools, will emerge as a key technology in this new regime. Beginning with this first step, the era of ""complex CMOS"", which requires complicated design elaborations and operating control, is predicted to begin. This key change will open up opportunities for new methodologies and CAD tools. Another major change in trend will be the shift in System-on-Chip design methodology from being processor-centric to either memory-centric or communication-centric, depending on the application. In the former case, nanostructured memory technology will be a key innovation, which requires completely new design expertise, including quantum physics. In the latter case, real IP reuse is the key, which will be enabled by a new specification language, such as the Object Wrapper language. Our efforts to standardize this new language and its design methodology are also introduced","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994870","","BiCMOS integrated circuits;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Design automation;Design methodology;Laboratories;Large scale integration;Logic circuits;Physics;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;specification languages","0.1 micron;1 V;CAD tools;CMOS technology;LSI design;Object Wrapper language;complex CMOS;design methodologies;multiple threshold levels;nano-structured memory technology;quantum physics;random-modulation CMOS;real IP reuse;specification language;sub-0.1 μm sub-1 V region;system-on-chip design methodology","","0","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two problems arise in this context. The first is the estimation of man-months for a project, with the knowledge of the ASIC design flow that will be followed for project execution. The second problem is that of making incremental changes to the design flow in order to reduce the time to complete a project. We consider these two problems in a theoretical framework. Starting from a textual description of the design flow, a model known as the hierarchical concurrent flow graph (HCFG) model is constructed to capture the concurrency in the execution of an ASIC design flow and the inherent hierarchy in such a flow. The HCFG model allows us to (a) quickly estimate the project execution time and (b) analyze the effect of introducing AND and OR concurrency in the flow to improve the execution time. We illustrate the use of the powerful estimation technique through two examples. The first example shows the use of AND concurrency in a back-end flow and the second example shows the use of OR concurrency in a software design flow","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994893","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994893","","Application specific integrated circuits;Asia;Concurrent computing;Educational institutions;Flow graphs;Instruments;Meeting planning;Power system modeling;Process design;Project management","application specific integrated circuits;circuit CAD;circuit layout CAD;flow graphs;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","AND concurrency;ASIC design processes;OR concurrency;design flow;hierarchical concurrent flow graph model;incremental changes;project execution time;textual description","","0","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is important for making early packaging decisions and planning the power grid. Keeping this in view, we propose a simple model which enables estimation of static power early in the design phase.

This trend has been recognized in recent research work. In this work, we present a physical model that takes into account inter-wire capacitances. Subsequently we propose a novel encoding scheme based on this physical model and targeted for address buses. We demonstrate that our encoding method improves power consumption by up to 62.5% and thus is exceeding all current approaches including our own previous one.

The traditional use of mathematics in engineering disciplines is via mathematical modeling - concepts and interactions in the problem domain are mapped to objects and relationships of a specific mathematical topic and then the formal deductions within the topic are re-interpreted in the problem domain. After a structured review of VLSI design flow and the identification of mathematical topics applicable to each step of the design flow, the tutorial illustrates these themes by a sampling of mathematical techniques applicable to analysis of modeling and simulation, partitioning, structural and behavioral decomposition, and symbolic reasoning about behavior. The tutorial is aimed at illustrating the importance of mathematics in VLSI, especially in the development of various tools, which are critical for design. The audience will be made to appreciate how some of the tools which are used by designers actually have some very deep mathematics built into them, without which it would be impossible for any automation in the design process.

Many existing approaches employ a bottom-up approach to pipeline validation, where the functionality of an existing pipelined processor is, in essence, reverse-engineered from its RT-level implementation. Our approach leverages the system architect's knowledge about the behavior of the pipelined architecture, through architecture description language (ADL) constructs, and thus allows a powerful top-down approach to pipeline validation. This paper addresses automatic validation of processor, memory, and co-processor pipelines described in an ADL.

This produces better results than those obtainable by individual techniques like net buffering or gate resizing applied to the circuit in various combinations. GDM transform is also layout-friendly since it does not alter the routing patterns and placement of cells, except possibly some buffer insertions/deletions. Hence it is useful for achieving timing closure in late stages of the design flow. We propose a comprehensive GDM algorithm that (a) determines the best replacement of a gate, possibly with inverted inputs and outputs, along with the best buffering configurations of nets incident on it, and (b) embeds this into a global scheme for optimizing large designs.

Unlike most previous synthesis and partitioning tools, this technique merges partitioning and system synthesis (allocation, assignment, and scheduling) into one integrated process; both are implemented within a genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms can escape local minima and explore the partitioning and synthesis design space efficiently. Through integration with an existing SOC synthesis tool, the proposed partitioning technique satisfies both the hard real-time constraints and the SOC area constraint of each partitioned segment. Under these constraints, our tool performs multi-objective optimization. Thus, with a single run of the tool, it produces multiple distributed SOC-based embedded system architectures that trade off the overall distributed system price and power consumption.

To develop a truly energy-efficient system, energy constraints should be taken into account early, in the design process; i.e., at the source level in software compilation and behavioral level in hardware compilation. Source-level optimizations are particularly important in data-dominated media applications that have become pervasive in energy-constrained mobile environments. This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of energy savings from using multiple low-power operating modes provided in current memory modules. We propose a source level data space transformation technique called array interleaving that colocates simultaneously used array elements in a small set of memory modules.

As these logic styles can implement only non-inverting logic, conventional logic design approaches cannot be used for Domino/Nora logic synthesis. To overcome this problem, we have used a new concept called unate decomposition of Boolean functions. However, two-level Domino/Nora realization for these functions are quite often not suitable for the realization of practical VLSI circuits having reasonable delay, because of the large number of series/parallel MOS transistors. To overcome this limitation, we have performed multilevel decomposition of each sub-function. The netlist produced by the multilevel decomposition directly maps (on-the-fly) to Domino/Nora cells. In order to analyze the circuits synthesized by our approach, we have estimated the delay and power of the circuits based on the models presented in the paper. Our result is then compared with the static CMOS circuits synthesized by standard SIS tool. Our approach has been found to achieve better results with regard to area, delay and power consumption compared to the existing approaches.

Instead of solving the problem at the bit-level, a method is proposed to transform conjunctions of bitvector equalities and inequalities into sets of integer linear arithmetic constraints. It is shown that it is possible to correctly model the modulo semantics of HDL operators as linear constraints. Integer linear constraint solvers are used as a decision procedure for bitvector arithmetic. In the implementation we focus on verification of arithmetic properties of Verilog-HDL designs.

Modules are open systems whose behavior is subject to the inputs it receives from its environment. It has been shown that verification of open systems (modules) is computationally very hard (EXPTIME complete, 1996) when we consider all possible environments. On the other hand we show that integrating the specification of the properties to be verified with the specification of only the valid input patterns (under which the module is expected to function correctly) gives us a powerful syntax which can be verified in polynomial time.

Since the proposed method makes full use of the existing two-level logic minimization algorithms, it can handle large circuits such as 64-input Boolean functions.

In this work, we have observed that with the use of fuzzy membership functions, human intentions for expressing a wide variety of requirements, e.g., minimize power, maximize gain, etc., which are often conflicting in nature, can be captured effectively in order to formulate the objective function. For each of the performance specifications of a given topology, a membership function is assigned to measure the degree of fulfillment of the objectives and the constraints. A number of objectives are optimized simultaneously by assigning weights to each of them representing their relative importance, and then by clustering together to form the objective function that is solved by an optimization algorithm.

Therefore, the induced voltages of the conductors may appear as the unknowns directly in the boundary integral equations (BIE). Compared with popular coupled circuit methods, the computational method based on the 3D Omni-A model has two advantages. First, it does not fix the current direction along the axis of conductor, so in this method the perpendicular conductors may have mutual impedance. It could be more accurate in deep submicron (0.1 μm) chips at high speed (10 GHz).

However, power gated circuits are different from the conventional designs in the sense that a power-gated circuit must be brought to a valid state from the power-off state, when all nodes in the circuit are at logic zero state, before useful computation can begin. Thus, estimation of the maximum current in a power gated circuit must determine the maximum of all possible power-up and normal switching current. In this paper we propose a cluster-based ATPG algorithm to estimate the maximum power-up current for combinational circuits. Our method achieves substantial improvement over simulation-based methods and also over the previously proposed ATPG-based methods. Further we also formulate the sequential circuit maximum current problem as a combinational ATPG problem, and solve it using the cluster-based estimation algorithm.

Variable voltage scheduling is performed only on general-purpose processors. The static scheduling algorithm constructs a variable voltage schedule via heuristics based on critical path analysis and task execution order refinement. The algorithm redistributes the slack in the initial schedule and refines task execution order in an efficient manner. The variable voltage schedule guarantees all the hard deadlines and precedence relationships of periodic tasks. The dynamic scheduling algorithm is also based on an initially valid static schedule. The objective of the on-line scheduling algorithm is to provide best-effort service to soft aperiodic tasks, as well as to reduce the system power consumption by determining clock frequencies (and correspondingly supply voltages) for different tasks at run-time, while still guaranteeing the deadlines and precedence relationships of hard real-time periodic tasks","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995019","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific integrated circuits;Dynamic scheduling;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;Heuristic algorithms;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Voltage","application specific integrated circuits;critical path analysis;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;processor scheduling","application specific integrated circuit;critical path analysis;dynamic scheduling algorithm;field programmable gate array;general-purpose processor;hard periodic task;multi-rate periodic task graph;on-line scheduling algorithm;real-time heterogeneous distributed embedded system;soft aperiodic task;static scheduling algorithm;task execution order refinement;variable voltage scheduling","","34","2","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important characteristic of this strategy is that different memory layouts that a given array will assume at run-time are determined statically at compile-time; however the layout modifications (transformations), themselves, occur dynamically during the course of execution. To test the effectiveness of our strategy, we used it in optimizing several array-dominated applications.

In a complex SoC design flow functional verification is very important; any behavioral or functional bug escaping this phase will not be detected in the subsequent implementation phases and will surface only after the first silicon is integrated into the target system, resulting in costly design and silicon iterations. A number of academic and industrial research laboratories have been carrying out research on functional verification of SoCs based on different approaches. Many of the issues relate to intrinsic limitations of some of the approaches taken; while others have to do with the quality of the design information, by way of design descriptions, design documentations and design specifications, from which the overall verification objectives are derived. SoCs have brought to focus the need to carry out design and verification concurrently. For the design and verification task to proceed concurrently there is a need to capture formally, design information and implementation details at various levels of abstraction. As designs become more complex, functional verification will have to be carried out using the divide and conquer approach.

The overall focus of our work is to generate a property-specific testbench for guided simulation, that is targeted either at proving the correctness of a property or at finding a bug. This is facilitated by generation of a properly-specific model, called a ""witness graph"", which captures interesting paths in the design. Starting from an initial abstract model of the design, symbolic model checking, pruning, and refinement steps are applied in an iterative manner, until either a conclusive result is obtained or computing resources are exhausted. This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of generating and using a witness graph for computation tree logic (CTL) correctness properties, practical issues related to the generation of a testbench, and experiences with an industrial example.

Frequently accessed cache blocks are woken up and others are put to sleep by controlling the threshold voltage. Since time overhead to change the threshold voltage can not be neglected, predicting a cache block which will be accessed in the next cycle is important. A history based prediction technique to predict cache blocks which should be woken up is also proposed.

We perform this characterization by obtaining a synchronization error probability curve from a histogram of the latch delay. The main metastability parameters of CMOS latches are τ<sub>m</sub> and T<sub>w</sub>. τ<sub>m</sub> is the exponential time constant of the rate of decay of metastability and T <sub>w</sub> is effective metastability window size at a normal propagation delay.

Care was taken to reduce reference spurs and supply/substrate injected spurs. The PLL uses two supplies. Charge pump and voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) work off a 3.3 V analog supply as it can give maximum VCO control voltage compliance, which helps reduce VCO gain, and hence reference and supply/substrate induced spurs. The digital part works off 1.8 V supply as 1.8 V core transistors give fastest switching which reduces phase noise in the dividers. The 3.3 V to 1.8 V interfaces have been optimized for the desired edges of output clock and phase comparison clock so that they have minimum contribution to phase error.

Our idea consists of two parts. One is to determine the optimum groups, each of which consists of cores, to simultaneously share mechanisms for the external test. The other is to determine the optimum bandwidth of the external input and output for the external test. We design the external test part to be under the full bandwidth of external pins by considering the trade-off between the test time and the number of external pins. This is achieved only with the CBET scheme because it permits test sets for both the BIST and the external test to be elastic. Taking the test bus architecture as an example, a formulation for test access optimization and experimental results are shown. Experimental results reveal that our optimization can achieve a 51.9% reduction in the test time of conventional test scheduling and our proposals are confirmed to be effective in reducing the test time of system-on-a-chip","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995014","","Bandwidth;Built-in self-test;Computer science;Energy consumption;Large scale integration;Pins;Proposals;Sequential analysis;System testing;System-on-a-chip","application specific integrated circuits;built-in self test;circuit complexity;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;minimisation of switching nets","combined BIST external test scheme;computational complexity;optimum bandwidth;system-on-a-chip;test accesses optimization;test bus architecture;test time minimization;wasteful external pin usage;wasteful test bus usage elimination","","1","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional DC noise analysis produces pessimistic results because it ignores the fact that a gate acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, the dynamic noise model considers the temporal property of a noise waveform and analyzes its effect on functionality. In this model, both capacitive and inductive coupling are considered as the dominant source of noise in high-speed deep-submicron circuits. It is observed that in the case of the local interconnects (where wire lengths are short), the effect of inductive coupling is small; however for long interconnects this effect may be considerable. Based on this noise model, we have developed an algorithm to verify high-speed circuits for functional failures due to crosstalk. The design of a 4-bit precharge-evaluate full adder circuit is verified, and many nodes which are susceptible to crosstalk noise are identified. It is observed and further verified by SPICE simulation that dynamic noise analysis is more realistic for verifying functional failures due to crosstalk than DC noise analysis","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994887","","Adders;Analytical models;Circuit noise;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Failure analysis;Integrated circuit interconnections;Low pass filters;SPICE;Wire","VLSI;capacitance;crosstalk;digital integrated circuits;equivalent circuits;failure analysis;high-speed integrated circuits;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise","DSM circuits;capacitive coupling;crosstalk noise;deep-submicron circuits;dynamic noise analysis;dynamic noise model;full adder circuit;functional failures verification;high-speed circuits;inductive coupling;local interconnects;long interconnects;noise waveform temporal property","","2","1","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we present two new methodologies capable of routing analog multi-terminal signal nets with current-driven wire widths. Our first approach computes a Steiner tree layout satisfying all specified current constraints before performing a DRC- and current-correct point-to-point detailed routing. The second methodology is based on a terminal tree which defines a detailed terminal-to-terminal routing sequence. We also discuss successful applications of both methodologies in commercial analog circuits","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994950","","Analog circuits;Application software;Automotive engineering;Coupling circuits;Current density;Digital circuits;Electromigration;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Wire","analogue integrated circuits;circuit layout CAD;current density;electromigration;integrated circuit layout;multiterminal networks;network routing;trees (mathematics)","Steiner tree layout;analog circuits;analog multi-terminal signal nets;circuit feature sizes;current constraints;current densities;current-driven routing;current-driven wire widths;electromigration;layout generation;point-to-point detailed routing;terminal tree;terminal-to-terminal routing sequence","","10","2","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As technology scaling continues in the deep sub-micron domain, interconnect parasitics have become dominant in determining chip performance and functionality. R(L)C parasitics play a major role in chip performance, functionality and signal integrity. In addition, parasitics have significant impact on chip reliability due to electromigration (EM), timing dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and channel hot carrier (CHC) effects. This tutorial covers several aspects of interconnect modeling from chip reliability perspective. Special emphasis is made on importance of modeling parasitic coupling in reliability analysis. A comparative study of coupled and decoupled interconnect modeling is discussed with simple examples and real life circuits","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994904","","Coupling circuits;Dielectric breakdown;Electromigration;Hot carriers;Instruments;Integrated circuit interconnections;Timing;Tutorial;Very large scale integration","ULSI;electromigration;hot carriers;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;semiconductor device breakdown","R(L)C parasitics;channel hot carrier effects;chip reliability;coupled modeling;decoupled modeling;deep sub-micron domain;electromigration;functionality;interconnect modeling;interconnect parasitics;parasitic coupling effects;reliability analysis;reliability verification;signal integrity;technology scaling;timing dependent dielectric breakdown","","0","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to conventional floorplanning, which only considers area and wire length, power supply noise aware floorplanning can generate better floorplan both in terms of area and peak noise. The decoupling capacitance required by each module is also calculated and placed in the vicinity of the target module during the floorplanning process. Experimental results on MCNC benchmark circuits show that the peak power supply noise can be reduced by as much as 40% and both the total area and wire length are improved due to the reduced total decoupling capacitance budget gained from reduced power supply noise","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994968","","CMOS technology;Capacitance;Circuit noise;Cost function;Noise generators;Noise reduction;Power generation;Power supplies;Switching circuits;Wire","VLSI;capacitance;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit noise;power supply circuits","MCNC benchmark circuits;VLSI;circuit modules;cost function;decoupling capacitance;decoupling capacitance placement;floorplan spatial correlations;floorplanning;floorplanning process;layout area;optimal floorplan;peak noise;peak power supply noise;power supply noise;power supply noise aware floorplanning;switching activities;target module;total area;total decoupling capacitance budget;total wire length;wire length","","3","2","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For FPGAs, we propose a two-dimensional, multi-rate cyclic scheduling algorithm, which determines task priorities based on real-time constraints and reconfiguration overhead information, and then schedules tasks based on the resource utilization and reconfiguration condition in both space and time.

We assume that these systems are based on a heterogeneous multiprocessor architecture. One of the key problems in the synthesis of such systems is that of scheduling the real-time tasks. The conventional approach to the problem has been to use a task graph to describe the dependencies among tasks and to assign constant weights to the nodes and edges of the graph. The node weights represent task execution times and the edge weights represent communication times. However, in many real-time applications, the execution time and communication times cannot be determined a-priori. One can use the conventional task graph model in such situations by taking the worst-case times, but such an approach is necessarily pessimistic and wasteful in terms of resource utilization. We propose a model which treats the task execution times and communication times as stochastic variables with beta distributions. A stochastic task scheduling algorithm is presented which maximizes the probability of meeting all real-time constraints. A genetic algorithm, which employs the stochastic scheduling algorithm, is used for the synthesis of a high performance embedded system at minimum cost.

Using DQM, the s-domain Telegrapher's equations of interconnect are discretized as a set of easily solvable algebraic equations, which lead to the rational ABCD matrix. The entries of ABCD matrix take the form of rational approximations with respect to s, rather than the conventional ABCD matrix whose entries are complex transcendental functions in s. Although the rationalization result is comparable with Pade approximation of AWE, DQM does not require moment-generating or moment-matching.

These data sets get to be typically stored in main memory, which means that the compiler needs to generate the address of a memory location in order to store these data elements and generate the same address again when they are subsequently retrieved. This memory address computation is quite expensive, and if it is not performed efficiently, the performance degrades significantly. In this paper, we have developed a new compiler approach for optimizing the memory performance of subscripted or array variables and their address generation in stencil problems that are common in embedded image processing and other applications. Our approach makes use of the observation that in all these stencils, most of the elements accessed are stored close to one other in memory. We try to optimize the stencil codes with a view of reducing both the arithmetic and the address computation overhead. The regularity of the access pattern and the reuse of data elements between successive iterations of the loop body means that there is a common sub-expression between any two successive iterations; these common sub-expressions are difficult to detect using state-of-the-art compiler technology. If we were to store the value of the common sub-expression in a scalar, then for the next iteration, the value in this scalar could be used instead of performing the computation all over again. This greatly reduces the arithmetic overhead. Since we store only one scalar in a register, there is almost no register pressure. Also all array accesses are now replaced by pointer dereferences, where the pointers are incremented after each iteration. This reduces the address computation overhead. Our solution is the only one so far to exploit both scalar conversion and common sub-expressions. Extensive experimental results on several codes show that our approach performs better than the other approaches","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995005","","Arithmetic;Computer architecture;Degradation;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Information retrieval;Optimizing compilers;Programming profession;Random access memory;Registers","embedded systems;image processing;optimising compilers;storage allocation","access pattern;address code;arithmetic optimization;common sub-expression;embedded system;image processing;memory address computation;optimizing compiler;pointer dereference;scalar conversion;stencil code","","0","1","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a new type of Petri net called Hierarchical Colored Hardware Petri Net (HCHP-Net). The gate-level circuit is first transformed into a directed acyclic graph called, GSDAG, in which both the gates as well as the signals correspond to the nodes in the graph. The GSDAG is then mapped onto a corresponding HCHP-Net which is then simulated using a Petri net simulator Experimental results for ISCAS '85 circuits are presented. The method replicates exactly the switching activity results for real-delay models produced by HSPICE and PowerMill.

The proposed technique is based on the fact that the computational complexities of programs or sub-programs are often highly dependent on the values assumed by input and intermediate program variables during execution. This observation is exploited in the proposed software synthesis technique by augmenting the program with optimized versions of one or more sub-programs that are specialized to, and executed under, specific input sub-spaces. We propose a methodology for input space adaptive software synthesis which consists of the following steps: control and value profiling of the input program, application of compiler transformations as a preprocessing step, identification of sub-programs and corresponding input sub-spaces that hold the highest potential for optimization, and transformation of the sub-programs to realize performance and energy savings. We have evaluated input space adaptive software synthesis by compiling the resulting optimized programs to two commercial embedded processors (Fujitsu SPARClite<sup>TM</sup> and Intel StrongARM<sup>TM</sup>). Our experiments indicate that our techniques can reduce energy consumption of the whole program by up to 7.8× (an average of 3.1× for SPARClite and 2.6× for StrongARM) while simultaneously improving performance by up to 8.5× (an average of 3.1× for SPARClite and 2.7× for StrongARM), leading to an improvement in the energy-delay product by up to 66.7× (an average of 8.2× for SPARClite and 6.3× for StrongARM), at the cost of minimal code size overheads (an average of 5.9%)","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.995018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995018","","Adaptive control;Application software;Computational complexity;Data preprocessing;Embedded software;Optimization;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Programmable control;Software performance","computational complexity;embedded systems;low-power electronics;optimising compilers;software engineering;subroutines","Fujitsu SPARClite;Intel StrongARM;compiler transformations;computational complexities;control profiling;embedded processors;energy consumption;energy optimization;input space adaptive software synthesis;optimized sub-program versions;performance optimization;portable low-power electronic systems;program optimization;value profiling","","0","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea behind IDDQ testing is to declare a chip as faulty if the steady-state current drawn from the power supply after the application of a test vector exceeds a threshold value. A CMOS circuit only consumes leakage power after the switching transients settle down, and a large quiescent power-line current indicates a defective chip. With device counts in system chips crossing into millions, the leakage power is no more insignificant, making IDDQ tests unsafe. Yet, IDDQ tests are invaluable since they can catch faults that are not testable using voltage testing. In this paper, we propose a solution to make IDDQ testing practical for large system chips. Our technique is based on chip partitioning and scheduling the testing of partitions so that IDDQ testing can be safely practiced. We formulate partitioning as a constrained optimization problem and propose two algorithms for partitioning. The objective function for the optimization problem is the test execution time.

Techniques to estimate leakage at the full chip level are indispensable for power budget allocation. In addition, simple and practical approaches and rules of thumb are needed to allow leakage to become part of the vocabulary of all designers. This paper focuses on the impact of circuit topology on leakage, which is often abstracted through what is referred to as the stacking factor. The stacking factor which captures the leakage reduction in series connected devices, is a first order term in leakage estimation equations and has significant impact on estimation results. The authors present two analysis methods, one mathematical and one empirical, to identify the stacking factor for leakage prediction. Understanding the stacking factor as well as obtaining an accurate estimate of its value, is critical in reducing prediction uncertainty. As leakage prediction becomes a bigger factor in roadmap decisions, reducing leakage prediction uncertainty will be key in accurate determination of product specifications","","0-7695-1441-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2002.994882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994882","","Circuit topology;Digital circuits;Microprocessors;Power dissipation;Stacking;Subthreshold current;Thumb;Uncertainty;Vocabulary;Voltage","digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit modelling;leakage currents;microprocessor chips;network topology","circuit topology;digital circuits;leakage estimation equations;leakage prediction;leakage reduction;microprocessors;power budget allocation;power dissipation;prediction uncertainty;roadmap decisions;series connected devices;stacking factor;subthreshold leakage current;technology scaling;topological analysis;voltage scaling","","9","","","","","2002","07 Jan 2002-11 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Power supply noise problem is getting worse due to serious IR-drop and simultaneous switching noise, and decoupling capacitance (decap) insertion is commonly applied to alleviate the noise. There exist some approaches to addressing this issue, but they suffer either from over-design problem or late decap insertion during design stage. In this paper, we propose a methodology to insert decap in a more efficient and effective way during early design stage in area-array designs. The experimental results are encouraging.

Sleep transistor sizing is the key issue when MTCMOS circuit is designed. If the sleep transistor size is too large, the circuit performance can be maintained but the dynamic power consumption of the sleep transistor will increase. On the other hand, if the sleep transistor size is too small, there will be significant performance degradation because of the increased resistance to ground. Previous approach (Kao et al., 1998; Anis et al., 2002) designed the sleep transistor size based on mutual exclusive discharge patterns. However, these approaches considered only topology of a circuit. We observed that two possible simultaneous switching gates may not discharge at the same time in terms of functionality. Thus, we propose an algorithm to determine how to cluster cells to share sleep transistors taking both topology and functionality into consideration. The results show that the proposed method can achieve on the average 18% reduction ratio in terms of the number of sleep transistors as compared to the method without considering functionality.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466477","","Circuit topology;Computer industry;Computer science;Degradation;Energy consumption;Leakage current;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Sleep;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;network topology","MTCMOS circuit;cell clustering;circuit topology;functionality directed clustering;low power MTCMOS design;multi-threshold CMOS circuit;sleep transistor;switching gates","","1","1","7","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapidly increasing design complexity, combined with the demand for the capability of handling nearly flattened designs for physical hierarchy generation, poses significant challenges to existing placement algorithms. There are very few studies on understanding the optimality and scalability of placement algorithms, due to the limited sizes of existing benchmarks and limited knowledge of optimal solutions. The contribution of this paper includes two parts: (1) we implemented an algorithm for generating synthetic benchmarks that have known optimal wirelengths and can match any given net distribution vector; (2) using benchmarks of 10K to 2M placeable modules with known optimal solutions, we studied the optimality and scalability of three state-of-the-art placers, Dragon (M. Wang et al, Proc. Int. Conf. on CAD, pp. 260-264, 2000), Capo (A.E. Caldwell et al, Proc. Design Automation Conf., pp. 477-482, 2000), mPL (K. Sze, 2002) from academia, and one leading edge industrial placer, QPlace from Cadence. For the first time our study reveals the gap between the results produced by these tools versus true optimal solutions. The wirelengths produced by these tools are 1.66 to 2.53 times the optimal in the worst cases, and are 1.46 to 2.38 times the optimal on the average. As for scalability, the average solution quality of each tool deteriorates by an additional 4% to 25% when the problem size increases by a factor of 10. These results indicate significant room for improvement in existing placement algorithms.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195099","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Computer science;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Logic design;Partitioning algorithms;Process design;Scalability","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit metallisation;network routing","Cadence QPlace;Capo;DSM technologies;Dragon;IC design process;circuit performance bottleneck;design complexity;flattened designs;mPL;net distribution vector;on-chip interconnects;optimal wirelengths;optimality;physical hierarchy generation;placeable module benchmarks;placement algorithms;scalability;synthetic benchmarks","","18","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several algorithms (J. Lillis et al., 1996; M. Hrkic et al., 2001, 2002; X. Tang et al., 2001) have been published addressing the routing tree construction problem. But all these algorithms are slow and not scalable. We propose an algorithm, which is fast and scalable with problem size. The main idea of our approach is to specify some important high-level features of the whole routing tree so that it can be broken down into several components. We apply stochastic search to find the best specification. Since we need very few high-level features, the size of stochastic search space is small which can be searched in very less time. The solutions for the components are either pregenerated and stored in lookup tables, or generated by extremely fast algorithms whenever needed. Since it is efficient to obtain solutions for components, it is also efficient to construct and evaluate the whole routing tree for each specification. Experimental results show that, for trees of moderate size, our algorithm is at least several hundred times faster than the recently proposed algorithms. Experimental results also show that the trees generated by our algorithm have almost same delay and resource consumption as the trees generated by SP-tree.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337600","","Circuit optimization;Delay;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Modems;Routing;Stochastic processes;Topology;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;buffer circuits;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;circuit complexity;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","SP-tree;VLSI;buffer insertion;buffer obstacle;integrated circuit design;network topology;routing tree construction algorithm;stochastic search;wire sizing","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they both do not consider the case where buffer/flip-flop blockages are present. In this paper, we enhance the MiLa algorithm and GiLa algorithm to consider blockage avoidance by finding alternative registered-buffered paths between each internal node inside a blockage and its parent node. The experimental results show that in comparison to the MiLa algorithm, our approach is able to find a solution with the same latency (for about half of the test cases) or even better latency (for the remaining test cases) and the same wirelength, while the buffer/flip-flop usage and CPU time are comparable or acceptable.

Recently, hybrid structures of H-tree and mesh were proposed to distribute the clock signal with a balanced H-tree and lock the skew using the shunt effect of the mesh. However, in multi-giga hertz regime, the RC model (Orshansky et al., 2002) of the mesh is no longer valid. The inductance effect of the mesh can even make the skew worse. In this paper, we investigate the use of a novel architecture which incorporates multiple level transmission line shunts to distribute global clock signal. We derive the analytical expression of the skew reduction contributed by the shunt of a transmission line with the length of an integral multiple of clock wavelength. Based on the analytical skew expression, we adopt convex programming techniques to optimize the wire widths of the multi-level transmission line network. Simulation results show that the multilevel network achieves below 4ps skew for 10GHz clock rate.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466139","","Clocks;Computer science;Fluctuations;Frequency synchronization;Inductance;Oscillators;Power transmission lines;Spirals;Transmission lines;Wire","clocks;convex programming;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;transmission lines","H-tree;RC model;analytical skew expression;clock rate;clock signal;clock skew;clock wavelength;convex programming;hybrid structures;mesh inductance effect;mesh shunt effect;multigiga hertz clock distribution;multilevel transmission line network;multiple level transmission line shunts;skew reduction;wire width optimization","","0","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
