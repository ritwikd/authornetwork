In their wake are new requirements that drive low-power design. This is however by no means the only driving force behind the need for a dramatic reduction of power dissipation in digital ICs. There also exists a strong demand on producers of high end products to reduce power consumption. Power minimization is thus vital for different reasons in different applications. Design knowledge and experience in minimizing power while optimizing performance is very limited. Low-power design is in its infancy. The same can be said for design tools. The opportunities for ultra low power tools and methodologies that achieve dramatic reduction of power and push higher up the design entry point are all around us. However, the need for tools that broaden the low-power design envelope is not being articulated by the user community very strongly. This panel seeks to expose solutions that designers and EDA vendors have, to present proper vehicles for transferring the low power design techniques and methodologies to the user community, and to provide a forum for exploring what is still needed. What design paradigms make sense, what levels of accuracy and speed are acceptable to the users and what tools have the highest payoff are part of what this panel is all about.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586694","","Design methodology;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Energy consumption;Information systems;Instruments;Large scale integration;Logic design;Power dissipation;Vehicles","","","","0","","","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several best selling business books have been written about the subject. Electronic design organizations have not been immune to this trend. As business becomes increasingly competitive, management pressure grows to get products to market more quickly. Meanwhile, engineering is struggling with how they will design their first 100,000 gate ASIC using more complex tools. Companies are forced into rethinking ways to radically improve design productivity. Company presidents are issuing corporate wide edicts such as ""10x design process productivity improvement by 1998"". Re-engineering the design process is one of the alternatives that some companies have tried. They have architected and implemented integrated multi-vendor design environments. They have installed automated parts library and workflow management systems. They have re-organized into cross functional teams, and trained their engineers on new design methodologies and design automation best practices. The journey of managing significant process change has been a long and arduous one down a road full of potholes. Murphy's law, cultural inertia, politics, inexperience, underestimating, underfunding, lack of top management commitment, and more have conspired to grind projects to a halt.

Such an interface design can be carried out based on the protocols used by the components. This paper addresses the problem of determining the feasibility of a design prior to synthesis. A design is called feasible if it achieves the desired functionality and satisfies the given environmental constraints. Because timing is an important aspect of a correct design, protocols are described using timed signal transition graphs, an interpreted Petri net. It is shown here that the feasibility of designs whose corresponding behavior is periodic can be studied using a technique called timing analysis for synthesis","","4-930813-67-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1995.486216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=486216","","Circuits;Delay;Hardware;Libraries;Logic design;Logic devices;Microprocessors;Protocols;Signal synthesis;Timing","Petri nets;formal specification;input-output programs;memory protocols;microcomputers;system buses","environmental constraints;functionality;interface design feasibility;interface logic;interpreted Petri net;microprocessor-based systems;protocols;system architecture;timed signal transition graphs","","0","","13","","","29 Aug-1 Sep 1995","29 Aug 1995-01 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Are these suppliers capable of keeping pace with the market demands, especially as electronics manufacturers push deeper and deeper into the realm of submicron design? During the past 12 months, there has been much discussion on the long term health, and even the viability, of the EDA industry. Many electronics manufacturers believe that the EDA industry, in its current state, will be incapable of delivering all of the technologies and solutions needed during the next ten years. Is the industry in a position to meet the needs of the electronics industry? What is the proper model that will enable the EDA industry to return to profitability and health and, therefore, be capable of delivering what the market demands? How do EDA suppliers intend to address this perceived problem? What is their vision for the future of EDA technology? What is their view on the role that their consulting service organizations will play in the future? This panel, which consists of executives from across the industry, will address these and other issues. Specifically, panelists will discuss their vision of how the EDA industry must evolve during the next five years, as well as their views on the future direction of design technology.

It also puts software debugging on hold until a new hardware prototype is available. In this paper we describe a hardware-software co-simulator that can be used in the design, debugging and verification of embedded systems. This tool contains simulators for different parts of the system and a backplane which is used to integrate the simulators. This enables us to simulate hardware, software and their interaction efficiently. We also address the problem of simulation speed. Currently, the more accurate (in terms of timing) the models used, the longer it takes to simulate a system.

As we move to deep submicron CMOS processes we are scaling the metal linewidth but not the thickness. This is increasing the parasitic capacitance of the wires to the point where the typical interconnect delay is larger than a gate delay. At the moment synthesis tools work by minimizing the number of literals in Boolean logic expressions and mapping to gates in a cell library with the smallest databook delay values. Instead of concentrating on logic synthesis and pre-layout simulation and adding the wires, almost as an afterthought, we will need to think far more carefully about interconnect. One of the ways to do this is to couple the synthesis and physical layout steps far more tightly than they are now. It is not at all clear how best to do this. Interconnect is one of the biggest, most visible, and perhaps most easily understood problems in deep submicron design, but there are others. In fact, there are many second- and third-order physical effects that are starting to become more important. In the past we have swept these problems under the carpet by using worst-case design. We can no longer afford the increasing number and increasing size of these pessimistic assumptions. Some other examples of effects we will need to consider: We will have to pay more attention to the shape of logic waveforms and not just their delay. Many ASIC vendors have already started to account for the effect of rise and fall times. We will need to develop methods to tackle interconnect coupling. We cannot afford to extract all coupling capacitances. With deep submicron processes we are moving into an era where we need low-power design, since batteries and packages donÕt seem to be keeping up. We need new tools and methods to help us in this area. Lithography is becoming very difficult as we run out of room in the light spectrum. At - the moment we put what we want on a mask and expect the lithography engineers to reproduce it on silicon.

In terms of implementing an FIR filter with more than ten taps, the same number of multipliers are required to be integrated. Moreover, for the preloadability of coefficients to the filter, each coefficient can be treated as a constant during the filtering operation. Motivated by these requirements and functionalities, a novel multiplier architecture is described, which is to be synthesized with the use of a high level synthesis tool PARTHENON in conjunction with manually designed macroblocks.

In particular, we show that the classical H-tree is sub-optimal in terms of both area and power dissipation when buffers may be inserted into the tree. We show that the power minimization problem is NP-hard and propose a greedy heuristic for power-optimal clock network design that utilizes the opportunities provided by buffer insertion. Our algorithm inserts buffers and designs the topology simultaneously. The results we obtain on benchmarks are significantly better than previous approaches in terms of power dissipation, wire length, rise times and buffer area. Power dissipation is typically reduced by a factor of two, rise times are four times better and buffer area requirements are an order of magnitude smaller.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586754","","Clocks;Costs;Delay;Design automation;Distributed computing;Permission;Routing;Space vector pulse width modulation;Wire;Wiring","","","","9","2","25","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Equivalence Checking of Datapaths Based on Canonical Arithmetic Expressions","Zheng Zhou, Wayne Burleson","Department of Electronic &amp; Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MA","Design Automation, 1995. DAC '95. 32nd Conference on","20061219","1995","","","546","551","Numerous formal verification systems have been proposed and developed for Finite Sate Machine based control units (notably SMV[19] as well as others). However, most research on the equivalence checking of datapaths is still confined to the bit-level. Formal verification of arithmetic expressions and synthesized datapaths, especially considering finite word-length computation, has not been addressed. Thus formal verification techniques have been prohibited from more extensive applications in numerical and Digital Signal Processing. In this paper a formal system, called Conditional Term Rewriting on Attribute Syntax Trees (ConTRAST) is developed and demonstrated for verifying the equivalence between two differently synthesized datapaths. This result arises from a sophisticated integration of attribute grammars, which provide expressive data structures for syntactic and semantic information about designed datapaths, and term rewriting systems, which transform functionally equivalent datapaths into the same canonical form. The equivalence relation is defined as a congruence closure in the rewriting system, which can be generated from arbitrary axioms, such as associativity, commutativity, etc. in a certain algebraic system. Furthermore, the effect of finite word-lengths and their associated arithmetic precision are also considered in the definition of equivalence classes. As a particular application of ConTRAST, a formal verification system is designed to check equivalence under precision constraints. The results of initial DSP synthesis experiments are displayed, where two differently implemented IIR filters in direct II and cascaded architectures are automatically compared under given precision constraints.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586763","Design Verification;High-Level Synthesis;System-Level Design Aids","Automatic control;Boolean functions;Commutation;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Data structures;Digital arithmetic;Digital signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Signal synthesis","","Design Verification;High-Level Synthesis;System-Level Design Aids","","7","","24","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DAC '95. 32nd Conference on","20061219","1995","","","455","455","The UNIX-based workstation had been the predominant platform at the mid- and high-ends of design. DOS-based systems were prevelant in the more general-purpose design realm. In recent years, however, competitively priced, high-performance technology from Intel and Microsoft has thrust PC-based desktop design into nearly all levels of the electronics design industry. The panelists, representing software, computer system, and EDA tool companies plus electronics designers, discuss the State of Operating Systems and the impact on electronics designers and the EDA industry. A panel member from Microsoft will examine the different versions of Windows and what each provides. Also to be discussed is the state of the DOS operating system; the impact that Windows NT and Cairo will have on UNIX; what a true Windows application offers the designer, and finally, how the Windows, DOS and UNIX environments can mesh. One panel member examines an approach that is already being implemented by several high-end vendors: supplying customers with design tools and more sophisticated services. This tools/services mix helps to compensate for software that cannot always measure up to the ""bleeding edge"" demands of silicon design. These vendors face the difficult task of structuring new business models to serve these customers in design environments with a multiplicity of platforms and operating systems, plus a lack of interoperability within EDA tools. Another panelist's perspective is that most of today's and tomorrow's design groups exist in a mixed O.S. environment. As such, there won't be one O.S. that wins the war, but rather several that will prevail. Suppliers who best satisfy user needs will share the design workplace. Another view states that over time, users will overwhelmingly select Windows desktop design because of its strong value proposition. This includes designers now working in a mixed environment. It may take them longer to switch to Windows because of their high invest- ment in UNIX-based tools. But they will eventually retire legacy systems for the price/performance of desktop design, and because Microsoft's Win 32 operating system provides all the functionality needed for the vast majority of users.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586746","","Application software;Computer industry;Electronic design automation and methodology;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Operating systems;Software systems;Software tools;Switches;Workstations","","","","0","","","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that, with respect to a manual design process, the use of these tools led to the following results: a five-fold reduction in the source HDL description complexity; equal or better timing performance; silicon area within 15% (4% area overhead for the DSP operator, and 14% overhead for the controller) and automatically compiled assembly code (from ANSI C descriptions) that is as compact as hand-coded assembler. We also identified a strong need to pay attention to design verification issues, especially when dealing with multi-level descriptions and multiple languages.

DAC '95. 32nd Conference on","20061219","1995","","","534","534","Electronic Systems Design Automation (ESDA) is a current cause celebre of the EDA industry. This panel first attempts to identify: ""What is the principal problem in ESDA?"" In fact, there are a number of emerging problems which are naturally considered to be within the domain of ESDA. Principally these include hardware-software co-design, representation of systems at higher levels of abstraction and links through synthesis to implementation paths in hardware and in software. Hardware-software co-design itself has a number of important sub-problems such as the co-synthesis and co-verification of systems of hardware and software. Representing systems at higher-levels of abstraction requires the ability to naturally express dataflow representations of sub-systems, control flow representations of sub-systems and modeling software executing on instruction-set processors. Probably of even greater concern to the audience is the question: ""Which commercial vendor is best poised to address these problems?"" Among current commercial EDA vendors, iLogix has established a strong presence in modeling the control-flow portion of systems, but not the dataflow. Conversely, the SPW tool of the Alta Group, the COSSAP tool of Synopsys and the DSP-oriented toolset of Mentor's European Design Center, have each shown successes in modeling the dataflow portions of systems but not the control flow. Finally the Race and Reveal tools of Redwood, now a part of the Alta Group, seem best suited to modeling instruction-set processors. In short, each of the major commercial vendors have provided solutions to some portions of the ESDA-related problems but none has yet been able to provide a comprehensive solution. The two problems of defining ESDA and determining commercial dominance will be discussed by the top engineering representatives of each of the major commercial players. In addition one of the best known researchers in the area, Prof. Jan Rabaey, will help to clearly identify the principal- problems of ESDA. Gary Smith, one of the major analysts of the ESDA industry, will provide his own candid perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of the vendors entering this arena.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586760","","Control system synthesis;Design automation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Electronics industry;Graphics;Hardware","","","","1","","","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea is to look at the power consumption in a microprocessor from the point of view of the actual software executing on the processor. The basic component of this approach is a measurement based, instruction-level power analysis technique. The technique allows for the development of an instruction-level power model for the given processor, which can be used to evaluate software in terms of the power consumption, and for exploring the optimization of software for lower power. This paper describes the application of this technique for a comprehensive instruction-level power analysis of a commercial 32-bit RISC-based embedded microcontroller. The salient results of the analysis and the basic instruction-level power model are described. Interesting observations and insights based on the results are also presented. Such an instruction-level power analysis can provide cues as to what optimizations in the micro-architecture design of the processor would lead to the most effective power savings in actual software applications. Wherever the results indicate such optimizations, they have been discussed.

DAC '95. 32nd Conference on","20061219","1995","","","364","369","The Elmore delay is an extremely popular delay metric, particularly for RC tree analysis. The widespread usage of this metric is mainly attributable to it being the most accurate delay measure that is a simple analytical function of the circuit parameters. The only drawbacks to this delay metric are the uncertainty as to whether it is an optimistic or a pessimistic estimate, and the restriction to step response delay estimation. In this paper, we prove that the Elmore delay is an absolute upper bound on the 50% delay of an RC tree response. Moreover, we prove that this bound holds for input signals other than steps, and that the actual delay asymptotically approaches the Elmore delay as the input signal rise time increases. A lower bound on the delay is also developed using the Elmore delay and the second moment of the impulse response. The utility of this bound is for understanding the accuracy and the limitations of the Elmore delay metric as we use it for design automation.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586730","","Contracts;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic design;Logic gates;Process design;RLC circuits;Upper bound","","","","7","1","20","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Safe replacement requires that a replacement design be indistinguishable from the original from the very first clock cycle after power-up. However, in almost any realistic application, the design is allowed to stabilize for many clock cycles before it is used. In this paper, we investigate the safety of a replacement if the replacement design is allowed to be clocked some cycles (that is, delayed) with arbitrary inputs before the design is reset. Having argued the safety of delay replacements, we investigate a new method of sequential optimization based upon the notion. We present experimental results to demonstrate that significant area optimizations can be gained by using this new notion of delay replaceability, and that there is a trade-off between the allowed number of clock cycles after power-up and the amount of optimization that can be obtained","","0-8186-7156-4","","10.1109/EURDAC.1995.527389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=527389","","Clocks;Delay;Design optimization;Flip-flops;Hardware;Latches;Optimization methods;Safety;Sequential circuits;Synchronization","optimisation;sequential circuits","power-up delay;sequential optimization;sequential synchronous designs","","11","","17","","","18-22 Sep 1995","18 Sep 1995-22 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Retiming moves the latches across the logic gates and in doing so changes the number of latches and the longest path delay between the latches. In this paper we show by example that retiming a design may lead to differing simulation results when the retimed design replaces the original design. We also show, by example, that retiming may not preserve the testability of a sequential test sequence for a given stuck-at fault as measured by a simulator. We identify the cause of the problemas forward retiming moves across multiple-fanout points in the circuit. The primary contribution of this paper is to show that, while an accurate logic simulation may distinguish the retimed circuit fromthe original circuit, a conservative three-valued simulator cannot do so. Hence, retiming is a safe operation when used in a design methodology based on conservative three-valued simulation starting each latch with the unknown value.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586722","","Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Delay;Design methodology;Latches;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Sequential analysis;Sequential circuits","","","","14","","9","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic algorithm of Maple-opt is top-down hierarchical bi-partitioning of regions. Technology mapping onto logic-blocks of FPGAs, their placement, and global routing are determined simultaneously in each hierarchical process. This simultaneity leads to less congested layout for routing. In addition to that, Maple-opt computes a lower bound of delay for each path with a constraint value and determines critical paths based on the difference between the lower bound and the constraint value dynamically in each hierarchical process. Two delay reduction processes are executed for the critical paths; one is routing delay reduction and the other is logic-block delay reduction. Routing delay reduction is realized such that, when bi-partitioning a region, each constrained path is assigned to one subregion. Logic-block delay reduction is realized such that each constrained path is mapped onto fewer logic-blocks.

While a Boolean function usually has a huge number of decomposition functions, we show that not all of them are useful for multiple-output decomposition. We therefore introduce the concept of preferable decomposition functions, which are sufficient for optimal multiple-output decomposition. We describe how to implicitly compute all preferable decomposition functions of a single-output, and how to identify all common preferable decomposition functions of a multiple-output function.

The proposed scheduling algorithm assigns an operation to a specific control step such that maximal sharing of functional units can be achieved with minimal number of memory ports, while satisfying given constraints. We propose a measure of multiport memory cost, MAV (Multiple Access Variable) which is defined as a variable accessed at several control steps, and overall memory cost is reduced by equally distributing the MAVs throughout all the control steps. When compared with previous approaches for several benchmarks available from the literature, the proposed algorithm generates the datapaths with less memory modules and interconnection structures by reflecting the memory cost in the scheduling process","","4-930813-67-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1995.486208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=486208","","Clustering algorithms;Costs;Electric variables control;Fabrication;Integrated circuit interconnections;Minimization methods;Process design;Registers;Scheduling algorithm;Very large scale integration","high level synthesis;integrated memory circuits;logic design","Multiple Access Variable;datapath synthesis;multiport memories;multiport memory cost;multiport memory minimization;register transfer level datapaths;scheduling algorithm","","3","","13","","","29 Aug-1 Sep 1995","29 Aug 1995-01 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, there have been efforts to develop concise formal specifications of such systems. We present a general strategy, based on the language containment paradigm, to automatically verify such memory systems against their formal specifications. The size of the state space explored during the verification is dependent on the number of data values, length of buffers, number of processors, and number of memory locations. Abstraction is used to reduce the number of data values to just two, and the number of memory locations to a small number without losing any accuracy in our verification. As an example, we concentrate on SPARC's V8 memory model, for which we have built a sample hardware description language model.

Based on them, a sufficient condition for analyzing complex dependencies is given. In the most general case, the conditional independence problem has been shown to be NP-complete and thus appropriate heuristics are presented to estimate switching activity.

In the proposed new cell model, terminals can be placed arbitrarily on the second layer of a cell so that each cell does not require the extra routing region on the first layer of a cell to align terminals. Unlike conventional cell models, some parts of the second layer are also utilized for the intra-cell routing in order to reduce the chip area. Therefore the size of the proposed cell model can be smaller than that of a conventional cell model. The proposed method consists of three phases. In order to utilize the proposed cell model, in phase 1, we simultaneously handle all channels to determine the most effective routing patterns from the set of possible routing patterns to minimize the chip area.

Rephasing, however, manipulates the values of these phases as a transformation before the scheduling. The advantage of this approach is that phases can be chosen to optimize the algorithm for metrics such as area and power. Moreover, rephasing can be combined with other transformations. We have developed techniques for using rephasing to optimize several design metrics.

In this paper possibilistic programming is proposed for handling the retiming problem where delays are modelled as (triangular) possibilistic numbers. Beside the capability of optimizing the most possible clock cycle time and generating its possibility distribution, it allows for trade-offs between reducing clock cycle time and chances for obtaining worse solutions.

University research projects have formed the basis for many important advances in CAD, and university graduates have provided the intellectual talent that has generated further ideas and turned ideas into commercial products. Research funding has been critical to universities both to enable the research to take place, and to support graduate students. Historically, much of this funding has come from the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense. Other important sources have included companies, such as IBM, and industry consortia, such as Sematech and the Semiconductor Research Corporation. Most of the industrial funding has come (either directly or indirectly) from manufacturers having significant in-house CAD groups, rather than from EDA vendors. In the past few years, funding for university research has proved increasingly elusive. Costs continue to escalate, particularly to cover graduate student tuition. Meanwhile, government funding agencies are under increasing pressure to direct their resources away from basic research and toward programs with greater short term impact. Manufacturers have scaled back their in-house CAD groups, breaking historic ties with universities, and they have been forced to justify any funding of university research to managers trying to survive as profit centers. EDA companies have made their products available to universities for educational purposes, and computer manufacturers have provided discounts on hardware purchases, but a funding gap remains in covering personnel costs. Meanwhile, many companies have scaled back their research groups, relying on universities to serve as their R&D arms. University researchers have responded to funding pressures by undertaking projects with shorter term objectives and with greater proprietary restrictions in order to obtain industry funding. They have also sought to gain from their intellectual property by such mechanis- ms as patents, software licensing, and affiliates programs that limit access to participating companies. These shifts have reduced the ability to pursue long term research topics and to freely disseminate research results. This panel will address the relationship between industry and academia, and the implications the changing relationship will have on the future of EDA.

In this paper, we investigate three gain bucket implementations and their effect on the performance of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning algorithm. Surprisingly, selection from gain buckets maintained as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stacks leads to significantly better results than selection from gain buckets maintained randomly or as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues. Our experiments show that LIFO buckets result in a 35% improvement over random buckets and a 42% improvement over FIFO buckets. Furthermore, eliminating randomization from the bucket selection is of greater benefit to Fiduccia-Mattheyses performance than adding the Krishnamurthy gain vector. By combining insights from the LIFO gain buckets with those of Krishnamurthy's original work, a new higher-level gain formulation is proposed. This alternative formulation results in a further 16% reduction in the average cut cost when compared directly to the Krishnamurthy formulation for higher-level gains, assuming LIFO organization for the gain buckets","","0-8186-7156-4","","10.1109/EURDAC.1995.527400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=527400","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computer science;Cost function;Data structures;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Partitioning algorithms;Performance gain;Production","iterative methods;logic CAD;logic partitioning","FIFO buckets;LIFO buckets;efficient gain bucket data structure;iterative improvement partitioning algorithms;logic circuits","","19","","11","","","18-22 Sep 1995","18 Sep 1995-22 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not the best for the synthesis of control-dominated circuits, which usually have variables/signals of different bit-width as well as very long lifetime. To go beyond register minimization by lifetime-analysis-based sharing, we propose holding some variables in the state registers, some signal nets, or some unclocked sequential networks.

This paper is concerned with the problem of synthesizing such hierarchically defined systems. When the individual components are synthesized and implemented separately, it is desirable to take into account the degrees of freedom that arise from the interactions with the other components and from the specification. Specifically, we consider how one can find the set of implementations that can be ""correctly substituted"" for a component in the system while preserving the behavior of the total system. The notion of correct substitution is formally defined for a hierarchical network of possibly non-deterministic modules and a new solution framework based on trace theory is presented to compute and represent this complete set of correct substitutions. We show that the complete set can be captured by a single trace structure using the notion of a ""maximal trace structure"".

Instead of sizing only the gates along the critical paths for delay reduction, the trade-off possible by simultaneously sizing gate and interconnect must also be considered. We show that for optimal gate and interconnect sizing, it is imperative that the interaction between the driver and the RC interconnect load be taken into account. We present an iterative sensitivity-based approach to simultaneous gate and interconnect sizing in terms of a gate delay model which captures this interaction. During each iteration, the path delay sensitivities are efficiently calculated and used to size the components along a path.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586790","","Algorithm design and analysis;Contracts;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit synthesis;Iterative methods;Logic circuits;Routing;Timing","","","","11","2","21","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach ignores the designer's knowledge of the general structure of the circuit to be synthesized. In this paper, we describe the HLS system SIDER (Synthesis by Initial Design Extension and Refinement). SIDER utilizes designer knowledge about the design space in the form of an initial circuit. By limiting search to the neighborhood of this initial circuit, much finer grain search can be performed yielding a higher quality design.

However, placement and binding strongly interact and design decisions taken during these phases determine the interconnect structure. As feature sizes continue to decrease, the delay caused by signal propagation through interconnect more and more dominate the overall system performance. Hence, optimizing interconnect becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose for the first time an analytical approach to capture the placement and binding problems in a single, unified Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model which also allows minimizing the overall interconnect structure. Such a model can serve as a starting point for deriving efficient heuristics in that it captures all information required for a comprehensive analysis of the problem. The target architecture is a linear bit-slice datapath, however, the model can be easily extended to handle two-dimensional datapath models","","4-930813-67-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1995.486396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=486396","","Circuit synthesis;Cost function;Digital circuits;Information analysis;Integrated circuit interconnections;Microelectronics;Mixed integer linear programming;Polynomials;Propagation delay;Signal synthesis","bit-slice computers;circuit layout;circuit layout CAD;computer architecture;high level synthesis;logic design","Mixed Integer Linear Programming;bit-slice architectures;datapath model;digital circuits;interconnect structur;interconnect structure;simultaneous placement and binding","","2","1","23","","","29 Aug-1 Sep 1995","29 Aug 1995-01 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We find that not only gates on noncritical paths can be down-sized, but also gates on critical paths can be down-sized. A power reduction algorithm by means of single gate resizing as well as multiple gates resizing will be proposed. In addition, to identify gates to be resized, a path-oriented method in calculating slack time with false path taken into consideration will be also proposed. During the slack time computation, in order to prevent long false path from becoming sensitizable and thus increasing the circuit delay, slack constraint will be set for gales.

Several researchers have suggested a wide range of signatures that have been used for this purpose. However, for each choice of signature, there remain variables that cannot be uniquely identified.

Several dynamic algorithms for compaction in combinational circuits have been proposed but, to the best of our knowledge, no dynamic method has been reported in the literature for compaction in non scan sequential circuits. Our algorithm is based on two key ideas: (1) we first identify bottlenecks that prevent vector compaction and test cycle reduction for test sequences generated thus far, and (2) future test sequences are generated with an attempt to eliminate bottlenecks of earlier generated test sequences. If all bottlenecks of a sequence are eliminated, then the sequence is dropped from the test set. The final test set generated by our algorithm is minimal in the following sense. Static vector compaction or test cycle reduction using set-covering or extended set-covering approaches (for example, reverse or any other order of fault simulation, with any specification of unspecified inputs in test sequences) cannot further reduce the number of vectors.

In the first phase, the fault list is equally divided among processors, each of which derives tests for targets from its list. A time limit is used to abandon the search for a test for hard to detect faults. Any test found is immediately used to simulate all faults, including those assigned to other processors. Due to the sequential nature of the circuit test vectors are not shared, but the fault simulation data are shared among processors. This phase terminates when only hard to detect faults are left. In the second phase, each remaining fault is simultaneously targeted by all processors, which now have different initial states of the circuit. The first processor to find the test interrupts all others, at which point all processors simultaneously target the next remaining fault.

Richard was also a strong supporter of the Design Automation Conference (DAC); he was the Chair of the conference in 1991, and gave a keynote address in 1995. He participated and chaired a half-dozen panels, and authored over 25 technical papers. His first paper appeared in the 1982 proceedings, and his research will continue to be used as a reference for many years to come. However, Richard's impact on DAC can not be so simply quantified. He was a leader and inspiration to everyone who participated in the conference for many years. And, he was instrumental in establishing and growing the essential relationship between the academic and industrial participants that make DAC a unique conference. As a community we are recognizing Richard's contributions and legacy in different ways. The Electronic Design Automation Consortium with friends and colleagues of Richard's have set up and funded an endowed professor chair at the Univ. of California, Berkeley. IEEE-CEDA together with ACM SIGDA have plans to award the A. Richard Newton Technical Impact Award in Electronic Design Automation to honor a person or persons for an outstanding technical contribution within the scope of electronic design automation. The DAC Executive Committee has also chosen to name our existing DAC Graduate Scholarships after Richard Newton. We feel that supporting young faculty and graduate research is an appropriate way to honor his vision and carry out some of his goals. For those young researchers who did not have the pleasure of knowing Richard personally, and are curious to learn about his work, they need look no further than the proceedings of the conference he helped shape to be inspired by the depth and breadth of his contributions to our field.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261116","","Newton, A.

The design and implementation of the EDIF family of standards is based on the use of the specification technique called information modelling. The goal of information modelling is to provide the standards development process with a methodology that will ensure, as far as is possible, that the contents of the standard are correct, consistent and clearly defined. The first part of the paper addresses the high level concepts and goals of information modelling. It looks at the basic mechanisms EXPRESS provides for capturing the essential objects and attributes of a domain and how those objects are inter-related. Above all, it concentrates on how constraints are used to ensure that the information model is explicit and unambiguous. The second part of the presentation focuses on the content of EDIF Version 350 and EDIF Version 400. The general architecture of the new EDIF standard is introduced and used to show how extensions of EDIF into the new domains of PCB and MCM are supported. The solutions adopted in EDIF to ensure a representation with minimal context dependency and hence, it is hoped, minimal ambiguity are highlighted","","4-930813-67-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1995.486354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=486354","","Assembly;Libraries;Manufacturing;Object oriented modeling;Standards development;Standards organizations","CAD;electronic data interchange;standards","EDIF;MCM;PCB;information modelling;standards development","","0","","","","","29 Aug-1 Sep 1995","29 Aug 1995-01 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many questions remain regarding its use in practice: Can these techniques scale up to industrial systems, where are they likely to be useful, and how should industry go about incorporating them into practice? This paper describes a project recently undertaken by SRI International and Collins Commercial Avionics, a division of Rockwell International to explore some of these questions. The project formally specified in SRI's PVS language a Rockwell proprietary pipelined microprocessor (the AAMP5, built using almost half a million transistors) at both the instruction-set and register-transfer levels and used the PVS theorem prover to show the microcode correctly implemented the instruction-level specification for a representative subset of instructions.

It can receive all the data with the rate of 512/1200/2400 bps of a single clock of 76.8 KHz. It is designed to have maximum 2 own frames for service enhancement. To improve receiver quality, a preamble detection considering frequency tolerance and a SCW (Synchronization Code Word) detection at every 4 bit is suggested. Also we consider an error correction of address and message up to 2 bits. Furthermore, it is possible with proposed PF (Preamble Frequency) error to achieve a battery life increase due to the turn-off of RF circuits when the preamble signal is detected with noises. The chip is designed using VHDL code from PDI2400 micro-architecture level. It is verified with VHDL simulation software of PowerView. Its logic diagrams are synthesized with VHDL synthesis software of PowerView. Proposed decoder and MC68HC05 CPU of MOTOROLA are integrated with about 88000 transistors by using 1.0 μm HCMOS process and named MC68HC05PD6.

The margin for profitability is indeed extremely tight because of the ever increasing performance demand which can hardly be satisfied by a corresponding progress of the process technology. It is therefore of utmost importance to avoid excessively pessimistic estimates of the actual cell performance in order to exploit all the potential of the fabrication process. In this paper it is described a technique that allows to determine the worst-case points with an assigned probability value. It is thus possible to select the desired level of confidence for the worst-case evaluation of digital IC designs with good accuracy. The results of the Assigned Probability Technique (APT) are presented and compared with those obtained by standard methods both at cell and at circuit level showing the considerable benefits of the new method.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586792","","Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Distributed computing;Fabrication;Microelectronics;Permission;Profitability;Software libraries;Timing;Very large scale integration","","","","4","","10","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike other possible approaches, our analysis does not require the user to identify state elements or give the timings of internal state signals.

When optimal termination is accomplished and transition rates do not exceed the capabilities of the net, the resulting delay metrics are an interesting extension of the popular Elmore delay metric for RC interconnects. The task of physical RLC interconnect design is facilitated by the ease with which these first few moments are calculated for generalized RLC lines.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586729","","Circuit synthesis;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Packaging;Power system interconnection;Power transmission lines;RLC circuits;Resistors;Transmission lines","","","","11","","8","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIPs) have been frequently designed using the HLS approach. Since most ASIP and DSP processors provide multiple addressing modes, and, in addition to classical constraint on the number of function units, registers, and buses, there are many resource usage rules, special considerations need to be paid to the optimizing code generation problem. In this paper we propose three transformation techniques, data management, data ordering, and transformational retiming, for storage optimization during code generation. With these transformations, some scheduling bottlenecks are eliminated, redundant instructions removed, and multiple operations mapped onto a single one. The proposed transformations have been implemented in a software system called Theda:MS. A set of benchmark programs has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of Theda:MS. Measurement on the synthesized codes targeted towards the TI-TMS320C40 DSP processor shows that the proposed approach is indeed very effective.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.250083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586695","","Application specific integrated circuits;Application specific processors;Constraint optimization;Digital signal processing;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit synthesis;Processor scheduling;Registers;Signal synthesis;Software systems","","","","1","","12","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe an efficient algorithm to produce counter-examples and witnesses for symbolic model checking algorithms. This algorithm is used in the SMV model checker and works quite well in practice. We also discuss how to extend our technique to more complicated specifications.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586741","","Asynchronous circuits;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Contracts;Debugging;Laboratories;Logic;Protocols;Sequential circuits","","","","13","12","13","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, it generates an initial partitioning with 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) so as to minimize the total wire length. Since there may exist constraint violations in the initial solution, in the second step, we formulate the partitioning problem as a LP problem selecting a maximal independent set and improve it until the total number of cuts is not decreased and the three constraints are satisfied. We also showed that the number of the timing constraints can be reduced by deleting redundant timing constraints. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is able to produce partitions satisfying the three constraints and improves the number of cuts by a 27% on an average and a 30% in maximum over the conventional method [15] considering only two constrains","","4-930813-67-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1995.486212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=486212","","Clustering algorithms;Delay;Integer linear programming;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Mathematical programming;Partitioning algorithms;Pins;Timing;Wire","logic CAD;logic partitioning;multichip modules","I/O pins;MCM system partitioning;chip areas;chip-to-chip;clustering step;mathematical programming;multi-chip modules;performance;physical constraints;system partitioning;timing constraints","","2","","19","","","29 Aug-1 Sep 1995","29 Aug 1995-01 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each layout element is modeled to simplify placement tasks subject to different placement constraints, and then a set of the interconnection requirements among elements is represented by a graph, to which a planarization algorithm is effectively applied.

Instead of increasing wire widths or lengths to reduce skew which results in increased power dissipation, we use a balanced buffer insertion scheme to partition a large clock tree into a number of small subtrees. Because asymmetric loads and wire width variations in small subtrees induce very small skew, minimal wire widths are used. This results in minimal wiring capacitance and dynamic power dissipation. Then the buffer sizing problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem: minimize power subject to tolerable skew constraints. To minimize skew caused by device parameter variations from die to die, PMOS and NMOS devices in buffers are separately sized. Substantial power reduction is achieved while skews are kept at satisfiable values under all process conditions.","0738-100X","0-89791-725-1","","10.1109/DAC.1995.249997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1586753","","Capacitance;Clocks;Delay;Distributed computing;Frequency;MOS devices;Permission;Power dissipation;Wire;Wiring","","","","6","","13","","","1995","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity of the task increases if there is no information about the initial state of the circuit. In this case an unknown initial state is assumed which is usually handled by introducing a three-valued logic. As it is well-known fault simulation based on this logic only determines a lower bound of the fault coverage. Recently it has been shown that fault simulation based on the multiple observation time test strategy can improve the accuracy of the fault coverage. In this paper we describe how this strategy can be successfully implemented based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.

Our timing optimization algorithm has been added to the placement algorithm which has yielded the best results ever reported on the full set of MCNC benchmark circuits, including a circuit containing more than 100,000 cells. A novel pinpair algorithm controls the delay without the need for user path specification. The timing algorithm is generally applicable to hierarchical, iterative placement methods. Using this algorithm, we present results for the only MCNC standard cell benchmark circuits (fract, struct, and avq.small) for which timing information is available. We decreased the delay of the longest path of circuit fract by 36% at an area cost of only 2.5%. For circuit struct, the delay of the longest path was decreased by 50% at an area cost of 6%. Finally, for the large (22,000 cell) circuit avq.small, the longest path delay was decreased by 28% at an area cost of 6% yet only doubling the execution time.

Such embedded systems typically have soft or hard performance constraints. The increasing complexity of these systems makes them vulnerable to failures and their use in many safety-critical applications makes fault tolerance an important requirement. This peeper is the first to address the problem of automatic hardware-software co-synthesis of fault-tolerant embedded distributed real-time systems in a generalized scenario. We present an algorithm which tales as input the specification of the data-flow information in the form of a task graph, the performance constraints, the fault tolerance requirements and the available hardware resources in the form of processor, ASIC and link libraries. Our algorithm then synthesizes the required hardware as a distributed system in terms of the component processors, ASICs and interconnection links. The tasks are mapped to this hardware such that the overall system cost is minimized while still meeting the performance constraints and the fault tolerance requirements. Our algorithm uses clustering techniques to perform the synthesis. Fault tolerance is added using CRAFT, a technique we recently proposed for CRiticAlity based Fault Tolerance in real-time distributed systems","","0-8186-7156-4","","10.1109/EURDAC.1995.527426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=527426","","Application specific integrated circuits;Automotive engineering;Clustering algorithms;Control systems;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Real time systems","computer aided software engineering;data flow graphs;development systems;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;formal specification;high level synthesis;real-time systems;safety-critical software;software tools","CRAFT;data-flow information;fault-tolerant real-time distributed embedded systems;hardware-software co-synthesis;interconnection links;safety-critical applications;task graph","","14","9","9","","","18-22 Sep 1995","18 Sep 1995-22 Sep 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has important implications for CAD in that, if the transition density is estimated by simulation, then minor inaccuracies in the timing models can lead to very large errors in the estimated activity. As a solution, we propose an efficient technique for estimating an upper bound on the transition density at every node. While it is not always very tight, the upper bound is robust, in the sense that it is valid irrespective of delay variations and modeling errors.

The number of publications has been rapidly increased after 1995, which shows recent quick growth of research activities. The survey includes several different viewpoints, such as circuit technologies, design and synthesis methodologies, applications and commercial use, etc. The circuit technologies and synthesis methodologies are roughly grouped into two categories, one of which has a close relation to BDD, while the other does not.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for selecting good lambda set variables in Roth-Karp decomposition to minimize the number of consumed configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in FPGAs. The experimental results on a set of benchmarks show that our algorithm can produce much better results than those of the previous approach (Wen-Zen Shen et al., 1995)","","0-7803-3662-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=600139","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuits;Data structures;Design engineering;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic;Matrix decomposition;Prototypes;Table lookup","decision tables;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD","BDD based;Binary Decision Diagrams;FPGA;LUT architecture;Roth-Karp decomposition;configurable logic blocks;lambda set selection","","1","","21","","","28-31 Jan 1997","28 Jan 1997-31 Jan 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a novel graph contraction technique, which allows some crucial delay information of a lower-level clustering to be maintained in the contracted graph, our algorithm recursively divides the lower-level clustering into the next higher-level one in a way that each recursive clustering step is accomplished by applying a modified single-level circuit clustering algorithm based on (R. Rajaraman et al, CAD of ICs and Systems, vol. 14, no. 12, pp. 1490-1495, 1995). We test our algorithm on the two-level clustering problem and compare it with the latest algorithm in (J. Cong et al, ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conf., pp. 389-394, 2001). Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves, on average, 12% more delay reduction when compared to the best results (from TLC with full node-duplication) of the aforementioned algorithm. In fact, our algorithm is the first one for the general multi-level circuit clustering problem with more than two levels.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195116","","Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Clustering algorithms;Combinational circuits;Computer architecture;Computer science;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Minimization;Polynomials","circuit optimisation;combinational circuits;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;logic design;minimisation;recursive functions","TLC;combinational circuits;contracted graph;delay minimization;delay reduction;full node-duplication;graph contraction technique;hierarchical FPGA;lower-level clustering;multi-level clustering;performance-driven clustering;recursive clustering;single-level circuit clustering algorithm","","0","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We start with any traditional FSM synthesis and optimization procedure; then reconstruct a functionally equivalent but topologically different FSM based on the optimization objective; and conclude with another round of FSM synthesis and optimization (can be the same procedure) on the newly constructed FSM. This allows us to explore a larger solution space that includes synthesis solutions to the functionally equivalent FSMs instead of only the original FSM, making it possible to obtain solutions better than the optimal ones for the original FSM. Guided by the result of the first round FSM synthesis, the solution space exploration process can be rapid and cost-efficient. To demonstrate this framework, we develop a genetic algorithm and a fast heuristic to reengineer a low power state encoding procedure POW3 (Benini and Micheli, 1995). On average, POW3 can reduce the switching activity by 12% over nonpower-driven state encoding schemes on the MCNC FSM benchmarks. We then reengineer these benchmarks by the proposed genetic algorithm and heuristic respectively. When we apply POW3 to the reengineered FSMs, we observe an additional 8.9% and 6.0% switching activity reduction. This translates to an average of 7.9% energy reduction with little area increase. Finally, we obtain the optimal low power coding for benchmarks of small size from an integer linear programming formulation. We find that the POW3-encoded original FSMs are 27.0% worse than the optimal, but this number drops to 6.7% when we apply POW3 to the reengineered FSMs.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466169","","Automata;Educational institutions;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Logic testing;Minimization;Power dissipation;Space exploration;Switching circuits","encoding;finite state machines;genetic algorithms;integer programming;linear programming;logic design;low-power electronics","FSM synthesis;energy reduction;finite state machine reengineering;genetic algorithm;integer linear programming;low power state encoding;nonpower-driven state encoding;optimization procedure;performance enhancement framework;switching activity reduction","","3","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The target implementation is a pseudo-static asymmetric CMOS complex gate for each output, known as a generalized C-element. The synthesis algorithm generates hazard-free covers for the set and reset functions of each output using Nowick and Dill's (1995) exact hazard-free logic minimization algorithm. Each output circuit is formed by mapping its set and reset logic to N and P stacks of an asymmetric CMOS gate connected to a sustainer; long-series stacks are decomposed into static gates followed by short stacks. A simple heuristic is used to ensure that no short-circuit paths exist from V<sub>dd</sub> to ground. The resulting circuits for small- to medium-size extended burst-mode specifications are 40% smaller and 30% faster than the two-level circuits generated by a 3D synthesis tool, and significantly smaller and faster than the complex-gate circuits generated by the method of Kudva et al.
