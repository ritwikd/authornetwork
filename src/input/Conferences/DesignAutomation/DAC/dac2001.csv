To correctly identify the design technology need, and to deliver this technology at the right time, the design technology community-commercial vendors, captive CAD organizations, and academic researchers-must focus on improving design technology time-to-market and quality-of-result. Put another way, we must address the well-known design productivity gap by addressing the design technology productivity gap. The future of design technology is most uncertain in the physical implementation space, where many complexities must be managed without sacrificing system value or turnaround time. This talk will begin with examples of changes in methodology and design tool infrastructure needed to support future physical implementation. Then, recent initiatives in the MARCO Gigascale Silicon Research Center (GSRC) are described which support the design technology and designer communities in creating the right design technology when it is needed","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913348","","Costs;Design optimization;Logic design;Productivity;Silicon;Space technology;Switches;Time to market;Timing;Wire","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;technology CAD (electronics)","DSM era;MARCO Gigascale Silicon Research Center;captive CAD organizations;design technology productivity;design tool infrastructure;process technology;system implementation platforms;time-to-market;turnaround time","","2","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is an emerging need for a practical solution to reduce the verification time. In manufacturing test, a well-known technique, “design-for-testability”, is often used to reduce the testing time. By inserting some extra circuits on the hard-to-test points, the testability can be improved and the testing time can be reduced. In this paper, we apply the similar idea to functional verification and propose an efficient “design-for-verification” (DFV) technique to help users reduce the verification time. The conditions for hard-to-control (HTC) codes in a HDL design are clearly defined, and an efficient algorithm to detect them automatically is proposed. Besides the HTC detection, we also propose an algorithm that can eliminate those HTC points with minimum number of DFV points. By the help of those DFV points, the number of required test patterns to reach the same coverage can be greatly reduced especially for deep-sequential designs","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913288","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Design engineering;Hardware design languages;Job design;Manufacturing;Modems;Process design;Test pattern generators","design for testability;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic CAD;sequential circuits","DFV points;HDLs;deep-sequential designs;design-for-testability;design-for-verification technique;functional verification;test patterns;testing time;verification time;verification time.","","1","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamic programming (DP) is an efficient and robust technique for finding optimal solutions to interconnect optimization problems in VLSI design. However, DP's huge memory requirement often limits its effectiveness and sometimes, due to limited storage resources, even makes it impossible to solve a problem of practical size. Since interconnect optimization is often a subprocess embedded in an upper level design procedure, a memory and time efficient implementation of DP can be very favorable to circuit designers. In this paper, we develop a new memory-efficient dynamic programming approach to interconnect optimization problems. Our method utilizes selective storage and recomputation technique. This memory and time efficient algorithm speeds up the dynamic programming method without compromising solution quality. Experiments show tremendous saving, both in storage and time, over traditional dynamic programming algorithms.

Theoretical expressions of both effects for point-to-point nets with a single obstacle are derived and compared to experimental observations. We also experimentally assess these effects for multi-terminal interconnections and in the presence of multiple obstacles.

Thus, to ensure timing closure between silicon and layout, DFM (Design For Manufacturability) related optimizations need to be taken care of when performing the parasitics extraction step. An example is given where the mismatch between measurement and layout based extraction data can be demonstrated already for a 0.25 μm technology. It is further shown that the inclusion of simplified process features by applying parameterized 3D-modeling will render sufficiently accurate extraction results. The proposed methodology is in addition efficient enough to handle complex layouts.

More efficient approaches find a minimum spanning tree only among edges in the Delaunay triangulation of the points. However, Delaunay triangulation is not well defined in rectilinear distance. In this paper, we first establish a framework for minimum spanning tree construction which is based on a general concept of spanning graphs.

Most of the research has focussed on the fanout optimization problem for a single net (or the local fanout optimization problem-LFO). The real goal, however, is to optimize the delay through the entire circuit by fanout optimization incurring minimum area penalty and without violating the pin loading constraints. This is known as the global fanout optimization (GFO) problem. In this paper, we show that the techniques proposed so far in the literature are either impractical or ineffective for large designs. We propose simple yet efficient and effective schemes for GFO and show that they outperform the “nearly-optimum” reverse topological (RT) algorithm on large industrial designs.

In certain applications we have to cope with ROBDDs with different variable orders, whereas further manipulations of these ROBDDs require common variable orders. In this paper we give a theoretical background for this “Multiple Variable Order problem”.

During this transformation, the circuit's functionality is not affected, while the speed is improved significantly.

In this paper we present a new architectural technique to reduce energy consumption in caches. Unlike previous approaches, which have focused on lowering cache capacitance and the number of accesses, our method exploits a new freedom in cache design, namely the voltage per access. Since in modern caches, the loading capacitance operated on cache-hit is much less than the capacitance operated on cache-miss, the given clock cycle time is inefficiently exploited during the hit. We propose to trade-off this unused time with the supply voltage, lowering the voltage level on the hit and increasing it during the miss. Experiments shows that the approach can save up to 60% of cache energy without large performance and area overhead","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913323","","Banking;Capacitance;Clocks;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Energy dissipation;Microprocessors;Phased arrays;Pipelines;Voltage","cache storage;capacitance;clocks;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;power supply circuits","access rate;area overhead;cache energy;capacitance;clock cycle time;dual voltage supply;energy consumption;loading capacitance;voltage per access","","0","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global multiterminal nets given an existing buffer block plan. We give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999) [see also Albrecht (2000) and Dragan et al. (2000)]. Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. In addition, our algorithm allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection and observes buffer parity constraints. Most importantly, and unlike previous works on the problem, we take into account multiterminal nets. Our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for the problem, which are based on 2-pin decompositions of the nets.

Its complexity results not so much from the number of devices, as from the complex interactions among devices or with the operating environment, and also from continuous-valued performance specifications. This paper addresses the problem of device-level placement for analog layout in a non-traditional way. Different from the traditional approaches-exploring a huge search space with a combinatorial optimization technique, where the cells are represented by means of absolute coordinates, being allowed to illegally overlap during their moves in the chip plane-this paper advocates the use of non-slicing topological representations, like (symmetric-feasible) sequence-pairs, ordered- and binary-trees. Extensive tests, processing industrial analog designs, have shown that using skilfully the symmetry constraints (very typical to analog circuits) to remodel the solution space of the encoding systems, the topological representation techniques can achieve a better computation speed than the traditional approach, while obtaining a similar high quality of the designs","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913319","","Aerospace industry;Analog circuits;Circuit testing;Cost function;Encoding;Process design;Radio frequency;System testing;Telecommunications;Transmitters","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;network topology;trees (mathematics)","analog layout;binary-trees;computation speed;continuous-valued performance specifications;device-level placement;industrial analog designs;nonslicing topological representations;ordered-trees;solution space;symmetric-feasible sequence-pairs","","0","7","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20020807","2001","","","521","526","In this paper we present FAST-SP which is a fast block placement algorithm based on the sequence-pair placement representation. FAST-SP has two significant improvements over previous sequence-pair based placement algorithms: (1) FAST-SP translates each sequence pair to its corresponding block placement in O(n log log n) time based on a fast longest common subsequence computation. This is much faster than the traditional O(n<sup>2</sup>) method by first constructing horizontal and vertical constraint graphs and then performing longest path computations. As a result, FAST-SP can examine more sequence pairs and obtain a better placement solution in less runtime. (2) FAST-SP can handle placement constraints such as pre-placed constraint, range constraint, and boundary constraint. No previous sequence-pair based algorithms can handle range constraint and boundary constraint. Fast evaluation in O(n log log n) time is still valid in the presence of placement constraints and a novel cost function which unifies the evaluation of feasible and infeasible sequence pairs is used. We have implemented FAST-SP and obtained excellent experimental results. For all MCNC benchmark block placement problems, we have obtained the best results ever reported in the literature (including those reported by algorithms based on O-tree and B<sup>*</sup>-tree) with significantly less runtime. For example, the best known result for ami49 (36.8 mm<sup>2</sup>) was obtained by a B<sup>*</sup>-tree based algorithm using 4752 seconds, and FAST-SP obtained a better result (36.5 mm<sup>2 </sup>) in 31 seconds","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913361","","Circuit optimization;Conductors;Cost function;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Runtime;Simulated annealing;Transistors;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;tree data structures","FAST-SP algorithm;VLSI layout;boundary constraint;cost function;fast block placement algorithm;fast longest common subsequence computation;placement constraint;pre-placed constraint;range constraint;runtime reduction;sequence pair based placement;sequence-pair placement representation","","39","3","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of layout modification for phase-assignability reduces to the problem of making a certain layout-derived graph bipartite (i.e., 2-colorable). Previous work by Berman et al. (2000) solves bipartization optimally for the dark field alternating PSM regime. Only one degree of freedom is allowed (and relevant) for such a bipartization: edge deletion, which corresponds to increasing the spacing between features in order to remove phase conflict. Unfortunately, dark-field PSM is used only for contact layers, due to limitations of negative photoresists. Poly and metal layers are actually created using positive photoresists and bright-field masks. In this paper, we define a new graph bipartization formulation that pertains to the more technologically relevant bright-field regime. The previous work by Berman et al. does not apply to this regime. This formulation allows two degrees of freedom for layout perturbation: (i) increasing the spacing between features, and (ii) increasing the width of critical features. Each of these corresponds to node deletion in a new layout-derived graph that we define, called the feature graph. Graph bipartization by node deletion asks for a minimum weight node set A such that deletion of A makes the graph bipartite. Unlike bipartization by edge deletion, this problem is NP-hard. We investigate several practical heuristics for the node deletion bipartization of planar graphs, including one that has 9/4 approximation ratio.

As a result, all existing mathematical programming approaches are often trapped at local minimum and have no guarantee of obtaining global optimal solution. In this paper, we present optimal clock tuning algorithms which effectively apply capacitance-padding to reduce clock skew, power, and delay for general clock topologies. Capacitance-padding can be achieved by wire-spacing, wire-splitting, wire-padding and transistor-padding. We show that under the Elmore delay model, capacitance-padding can be formulated as a linear programming problem and solved with great efficiency.

As a result, the QMM algorithm can greatly reduce the CPU time and memory space used in the capacitance extraction.

Finally, in the third step, we complete the remaining local short connection between net terminals and those assigned wire segments and resolve any violations or congestion. We have incorporated this approach into an industrial VDSM design flow. Experimental results on large benchmark circuits implemented in a TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS process have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We first define our distributed target architecture, which minimizes the effect of interconnect delay on clock cycle time. We no longer assume that interconnect delay between functional units is a part of one clock cycle, interconnect delay can span over multiple clock cycles. We incorporate the concept of multi-cycle interconnect delay into scheduling and binding process, to reduce the critical path length and therefore the system latency.

A technique for minimizing the overall sum of switching probabilities is presented. The method is based on efficient local operations on a BDD representing the functionality of the circuit to be realized.

The interconnect wire is modeled by the transmission line model which is more accurate and efficient than lumped circuit model. For the interconnect wire, we specify the wire shape to be of the form f(x)=ae<sup>-bx</sup>. Note that if we let b=0, our work is reduced to uniform wire case. By using the first three poles in the transfer function, we derive analytical expressions for calculating delay at any threshold voltage under a finite ramp input. The expressions involved in calculating coefficients in the transfer function are also analytical. We use k-factor equations to estimate delays for buffers. Since the k-factor equations require a loading capacitance for delay computation, we use the effective capacitance technique to calculate the effective capacitance for each interconnect wire which is connected to a buffer. Therefore, our delay calculation for buffered interconnects is analytical and thus very efficient.

Furthermore, it is well known that simply discarding smallest terms to sparsify the inductance matrix can render the partial inductance matrix indefinite and result in an unstable circuit model. Recently a new circuit element, K, has been introduced to capture the global effect of inductance by evaluating a corresponding sparse K matrix. However, the reason that K has such local properties is not clear, and the positive semi-definiteness of the corresponding sparse K matrix is not proved. In this paper, we present the physical interpretation of K. Based on the physical interpretation, we explain why the faraway mutual K can be ignored (locality) and prove that after ignoring faraway mutual K, the resultant K matrix is positive definite (stability). Together with a RKC equivalent circuit model, the locality and stability enables us to simulate an RKC circuit directly and efficiently for real circuits. A new circuit simulation tool, KSim, has been developed by incorporating the new circuit element K into Berkeley SPICE. The RKC simulation matches better with the full partial inductance matrix simulation with significant less computing time and memory usage, compared to other proposed methods, such as the shift-truncate method","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913336","","Circuit simulation;Circuit stability;Computational modeling;Coupling circuits;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Microelectronics;SPICE;Sparse matrices;Wiring","circuit simulation;equivalent circuits;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;matrix algebra;stability;transient analysis","Berkeley SPICE;KSim simulator;RKC equivalent circuit model;circuit simulation tool;onchip inductance effect capture;partial inductance matrix simulation;stable RKC simulator","","19","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes area and delay estimation equations for digital signal processor cores. For area estimation, we show that total area for a processor core can be derived from the sum of area for a processor kernel and area for additional hardware units. Area for a processor kernel can be mainly obtained by minimum area for a processor kernel and overheads for adding hardware units and registers. Area for a hardware unit can be mainly obtained by its type and operation bit width. For delay estimation, we show that critical path delay for a processor core can be derived from the delay of a hardware unit which is on the critical path in the processor core. Experimental results demonstrate that errors of area estimation are less than 2% and errors of delay estimation are less than 2ns when comparing estimated area and delay with logic-synthesized area and delay","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913297","","Application software;Delay estimation;Digital signal processors;Equations;Estimation error;Hardware;Kernel;Registers;Signal synthesis;Software systems","circuit CAD;delay estimation;digital signal processing chips;hardware-software codesign","DSP cores;area/delay estimation;critical path delay;delay estimation;digital signal processor cores;hardware/software cosynthesis system;hardware/software partitioning;processor kernel","","2","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20020807","2001","","","231","234","In some modern FPGAs and CPLDs, PLA (programmable logic array)-style logic blocks can be used as the storage elements for improved logic density and performance. PLA-style logic blocks were originally deployed in the early PLDs. Due to recent research developments in the FPGA community, PLA-style logic blocks are becoming an effective storage alternative in FPGAs. This paper presents an approach with clustering and functional decomposition to implement the circuit using the minimum number of PLA-style logic blocks. One important feature is that it simultaneously considers the routing resource reduction for better circuit performance after place-and-route. In order to effectively use PLA-style logic blocks in large clusters, functional decompositions are used to decompose large clusters so that the encoding functions and base functions can be mapped into PLA-blocks. Furthermore, implicit representation of the crucial steps in the functional decomposition is used to consider: 1) number of inputs; 2) number of product terms; and 3) number of outputs required for the PLA-block synthesis. We have developed an algorithm called PLA-SynT that can be used in the logic synthesis flow for CPLDs and FPGAs with PLA-blocks. MCNC benchmarks are used to test PLA-SynT and the experimental results are compared with TEMPLA. PLA-SynT shows 10.24% improvement over TEMPLA, in terms of the number of PLA-blocks needed to implement the circuit.

Thus low power implementations of advanced channel decoding techniques are mandatory. In this paper we present a low power implementation of the most sophisticated channel decoding algorithm (turbo-decoding) on programmable architectures. Low power optimization is performed on two abstraction levels: on the system level by the use of an intelligent cancellation technique, and on the implementation level by the use of dynamic voltage scaling. With these techniques we can reduce the worst case energy consumption to 55% using data of state-of-the-art processors. Our approach is also applicable for hardware implementations.

Alternative wiring refers to the process of adding a redundant connection to a circuit such that a target connection will become redundant and can be removed from the circuit without altering the functionality of the circuit. The well-known ATPG-based alternative wiring scheme, redundancy addition and removal for multi-level Boolean optimization (RAMBO), has shown its effectiveness in solving the problem in the last decade. The deficiency of RAMBO lies in its long execution time for redundancy identification among a large set of candidate alternative wires in the circuit. Implication-tree based alternative wiring logic transformation algorithm (IBAW) improves the speed of RAMBO by introducing an implication-tree structure for source node identification. Our approach of investigating the dominator relationship suggests that a large subset of unnecessary redundancy checks can be further avoided in order to improve the efficiency. Experiments were performed on MCNC benchmark circuits and results are compared to those of RAMBO and IBAW. Results show that our proposed algorithm improves IBAW with a 2.3 times speedup. Moreover, our implementation runs 8.8 times faster than RAMBO while solution quality is still maintained","","0-7803-6633-6","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2001.913353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913353","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic;Random access memory;Wire;Wiring","Boolean functions;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD;multivalued logic circuits;redundancy;trees (mathematics);wiring","MCNC benchmark circuits;alternative wiring problem;dominator relationship;execution time;implication-tree based alternative wiring logic transformation algorithm;multi-level Boolean optimization;redundancy addition;redundancy identification;redundant connection;solution quality;source node identification","","0","","","","","2001","30 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the technology shrinks and the design density increases, proper planning of routing resources becomes all the more important to ensure rapid and feasible design convergence. One of the most important issues for planning interconnection is the ability to predict the routability of a given placed design. This paper provides insight into the workings of recently proposed method by Lou et al. (2001) and compares it with our proposed methodology, fGREP (2001). We have implemented the two methods for a generic FPGA architecture and compare the performance, accuracy and usability of their estimates. We use the well known FPGA physical design suite VPR (1997), as a common comparison tool. Our experiments show that fGREP produces far better routing estimates but at larger execution times than Lou's method.

In particular, faster custom speeds are achieved by a combination of factors: good architecture with well-balanced pipelines; compact logic design; timing overhead minimization; careful floorplanning, partitioning and placement; dynamic logic; post-layout transistor and wire sizing; and speed binning of chips. Closing the speed gap requires improving these same factors in ASICs, as far as possible. In this paper we examine a practical example of how these factors may be improved in ASICs.

But all these algorithms are slow and not scalable. We propose an algorithm, which is fast and scalable with problem size. The main idea of our approach is to specify some important high-level features of the whole routing tree so that it can be broken down into several components. We apply stochastic search to find the best specification. Since we need very few high-level features, the size of stochastic search space is small which can be searched in very less time. The solutions for the components are either pregenerated and stored in lookup tables, or generated by extremely fast algorithms whenever needed. Since it is efficient to obtain solutions for components, it is also efficient to construct and evaluate the whole routing tree for each specification. Experimental results show that, for trees of moderate size, our algorithm is at least several hundred times faster than the recently proposed algorithms. Experimental results also show that the trees generated by our algorithm have almost same delay and resource consumption as the trees generated by SP-tree.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337600","","Circuit optimization;Delay;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Modems;Routing;Stochastic processes;Topology;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;buffer circuits;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;circuit complexity;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","SP-tree;VLSI;buffer insertion;buffer obstacle;integrated circuit design;network topology;routing tree construction algorithm;stochastic search;wire sizing","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing resource allocation and distribution are serious concerns in buffered routing of deep submicron design. The capability of capturing the tradeoff between routing resource cost and signal delay is crucial in practice since the resource overuse of min-delay solution may cause congestion problem (congestion also means over-inserting buffers). However, many existing algorithms are mainly designed to minimize signal delay. Here, we first study the problem of minimizing the linear combination of delay and cost, and extend the graph-based algorithm in [X. Tang et al., (2001)] to solve it. We then show that a variant of the algorithm can solve other problems such as maximizing delay reduction to cost ratio, minimizing routing cost subject to a delay constraint, and minimizing delay subject to the cost not exceeding a given budget. We also develop a hierarchical approach to buffered routing construction for problems with large number of sinks to tradeoff solution quality and runtime.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337613","","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Delay lines;Integrated circuit interconnections;Resource management;Routing;Runtime;Signal design;System-on-a-chip;Wire","buffer storage;circuit analysis computing;graph theory;minimisation;network routing;resource allocation","buffered routing;graph-based algorithm;routing resource allocation;routing resource cost;signal delay;submicron design","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
