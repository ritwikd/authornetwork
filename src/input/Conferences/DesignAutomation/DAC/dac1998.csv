This development of SEMATECH's Chip Hierarchical Design System (CHDS) includes major technological investments in algorithms for design planning, parasitic extraction, and signal integrity verification. The foundation of CHDS is an open design model and API upon which these tools are integrated. This model must support a number of critical requirements including: A data scope that includes connectivity, electrical data, physical data, and timing; Design hierarchy and incremental access to data; A central delay architecture; Efficient, application-selected views of the data. This paper introduces the Integrated Data Model technology being used for CHDS Beta development and its use as the basis for the design of an industry-open specification called the CHDS Technical Data Specification (CHDStd)","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669458","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Delay;Investments;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Semiconductor device manufacture;Signal design;Technology planning;Timing","circuit analysis computing;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit design","CHDStd;SEMATECH;concurrent design and analysis;constraint directives;deep submicron design tools;design planning;incremental processing;industry-open specification;integrated data model technology;parasitic extraction;signal integrity verification","","0","1","8","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, it is shown in which way these techniques are applied in order to cope with contradictory design goals like performance constraints and hardware effort constraints. As a solution, we present a cost function for the purpose of hardware/software partitioning that offers a dynamic weighting of its components.

This paper overcomes this limitation and proposes an optimization algorithm to define the best tradeoff between the CPU core, RAM and ROM of an ASIP chip to achieve the highest performance while satisfying design constraints on the chip area. The partitioning problem is formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem that partitions the operations into hardware and software so that the performance of the designed ASIP is maximized under given chip area constraint, where the chip area includes the HW cost of the register file for a given application program with the associated input data set. The optimization problem is parameterized so that it can be applied with different technologies to synthesize CPU cores, RAMs or ROMs. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is found to be effective and efficient","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669502","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application specific processors;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Design optimization;Hardware;Partitioning algorithms;Read only memory;Registers;Software performance","high level synthesis;optimisation;performance evaluation;real-time systems","ASIPs;RAM;ROM;application specific integrated processors;combinatorial optimization problem;performance maximization algorithm;register file","","3","","19","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a bandwidth adjusting (adaptive) algorithm is presented, which allow both fast acquisition and significant jitter reduction for each different noise environment and hardware requirement. This algorithm, based on the recursive least squares (RLS) criterion, suggests an optimal sequence of control parameters for a dual-loop DPLL which achieves the fastest initial acquisition time by trying to minimize the jitter variance in any given time instant. The algorithm can be used for carrier recovery or clock recovery in mobile communications, local area networks and disk drives that require a short initial preamble period","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669499","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Data communication;Frequency;Hardware;Jitter;Noise reduction;Phase locked loops;Steady-state;Working environment noise","digital phase locked loops;jitter;logic design;mobile communication","adaptive clock recovery;bandwidth adjusting algorithm;carrier recovery;clock recovery;digital data transmission receivers;disk drives;dual-loop digital PLL design;hardware requirement;jitter reduction;jitter variance;local area networks;mobile communications;noise environment;recursive least squares criterion","","0","","8","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our objective is to minimize the number of distinct products in the sum-of-products expressions of EX-SOPs. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It recursively applies the Shannon decomposition on a function with more than five variables. The algorithm obtains EX-SOPs for the five-variable functions by using an exact minimization program, then combines those EX-SOPs to generate EX-SOPs for the functions with more variables. We present experimental results for a set of benchmark functions, and show that EX-SOPs require many fewer products and literals than sum-of-products expressions.

Finally, the macromodel is used in order to evaluate the delay caused by crosstalk effects. The methodology described has been implemented in a sign-off tool that can be effectively used to evaluate crosstalk effects in signal integrity analysis of large digital circuits.

At the stage of rapid system prototyping, design specifications can often be changed since they cannot always be determined completely. In this paper, layout design change is focused on and a layout reconfiguration algorithm is proposed for FPGAs. In layout reconfiguration, the main problem is to add LUTs to initial layouts. Our algorithm consists of two steps: For given placement and global routing of LUTs, Step 1 places an added LUT with allowing that the position of the added LUT may overlap that of a preplaced LUT; Then Step 2 moves preplaced LUTs to their adjacent positions so that the overlap of the LUT positions can be resolved. Global routes are updated corresponding to reconfiguration of placement. The algorithm keeps routing congestion small by evaluating global routes directly both in Steps 1 and 2. Especially in Step 2, if the minimum number of preplaced LUTs are moved to their adjacent positions, our algorithm minimizes routing congestion. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669540","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data structures;Delay;Design engineering;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic design;Prototypes;Reconfigurable logic;Routing;Table lookup","circuit layout CAD;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;network routing","design specifications;field-programmable gate arrays;global routing;incremental placement;layout design;layout reconfiguration;rapid system prototyping","","1","5","14","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Focusing BSC, to support an effective use, this paper develops techniques to handle rectilinear modules and modules with positional constraints. First a solution is proposed for pre-placed modules. It is to give a linear order to the floating modules following which they are embedded in packing. In the course, the pre-placed modules are considered as the constraints such that no floating modules are forbidden to be placed. The packing of modules including rectilinear ones is solved by applying the above techniques after rectilinear modules are sliced into a set of rectangles.

Basically the decompositions, Shannon, positive Davio and negative Davio, inherent in ETDDs are employed to generate complex terms. While traversing the ETDD can be done in a simple and efficient way for completely specified functions, the manipulation of ETDDs with don't care terms becomes very complex because the three decompositions require different evaluations of the function. The changes made to the function due to don't cares in each decomposition are analyzed and an approximation algorithm is presented with its applications to the synthesis of complex terms","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Boolean functions;Computer architecture;Computer science;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic arrays;Logic devices;Programmable logic arrays;Signal synthesis","Boolean functions;cellular arrays;decision tables;field programmable gate arrays;logic design","Atmel 6000;Boolean functions;ETDD;EXOR Ternary Decision Diagram;FPGAs;cell arrays;cellular architecture;complex terms;don't cares;logic expressions","","0","","11","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These features consist of several MUXs and registers and reduce the number of gates over 20% compared with existing chips using an address generation unit and a module unit. Since parallel multipliers occupy a large VLSI area, a filter chip using bit-serial multipliers meeting the real-time requirement specification can dramatically save the area. We propose a modified bit-serial multiplication algorithm to compute two partial products in parallel, and thus, the proposed filter can be twice faster than previous filters using bit-serial multipliers.

The proposed loop pipelining technique, which is an adaptation of a compiler optimization technique for instruction level parallelism, increases parallelism within a loop by transforming the structure of an input system description. By combining this technique with our partitioning algorithm, we can further reduce the hardware cost and/or improve the performance of the partitioned system.

Efficient BDD construction techniques become more important as the complexity of protocol and circuit designs increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing three techniques based on working set control. First, we introduce a novel BDD construction algorithm based on partial breadth-first expansion. This approach has the good memory locality of the breadth-first BDD construction while maintaining the low memory overhead of the depth-first approach. Second, we describe how memory management on a per-variable basis can improve spatial locality of BDD construction at all levels, including expansion, reduction, and rehashing. Finally, we introduce a memory compacting garbage collection algorithm to remove unreachable BDD nodes and minimize memory fragmentation. Experimental results show that when the applications fit in physical memory, our approach has speedups of up to 1.6 in comparison to both depth-first (CUDD) and breadth-first (GAL) packages. When the applications do not fit into physical memory, our approach outperforms both CUDD and CAL by up to an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the good memory locality and low memory overhead of this approach has enabled us to be the first to have successfully constructed the entire C6288 multiplication circuit from the ISCAS85 benchmark set using only conventional BDD representations","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669515","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Data structures;Formal verification;Government;Memory management;Packaging;Protocols","circuit CAD;computational complexity;formal verification;storage management","ISCAS85 benchmark set;binary decision diagrams;circuit designs;complexity;formal verification;memory compacting garbage collection algorithm;memory locality;memory management;partial breadth-first expansion;protocol;spatial locality;working set control","","4","1","21","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The strength of the approach lies in the dynamic programming-based algorithm, SiMPA-D, used for performing simultaneous technology mapping and linear placement of logic clusters. This algorithm generates a set of solutions for each cluster, all of which are noninferior (in terms of gate area, cutwidth and delay), and hence permits trade-offs between total area (gate plus wiring) and total delay (gate plus wiring).

Based on this observation, we propose a method to construct a hybrid power model for RTL modules. We further propose a hierarchical power estimation method for estimating the power dissipation of data-path consisting of RTL modules.

First, a module library model which assumes the probabilistic nature of functional unit delays is presented.

From the experiments we obtained the result that the average CPU time of the detailed routing algorithm is almost linear to the length of a wire. Since the curvilinear detailed routing is efficient in terms of space usage, the proposed algorithm is important especially for densely wired printed circuit boards such as PGA packages, BGA packages, and MCMs. We can also expect improvements on the electrical characteristics and the production yield by applying wire-spreading and wire-fattening to them","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669505","","Electronics packaging;Euclidean distance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Laboratories;Printed circuits;Production;Routing;Topology;Wires;Wiring","circuit layout CAD;multichip modules;printed circuits","BGA packages;Gao's algorithm;MCMs;PGA packages;average time performance;curvilinear detailed routing algorithm;electrical characteristics;fan-shaped forbidden regions;printed circuit boards;wire-fattening;wire-spreading","","1","","7","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we show that finding the optimally compacted test set can be cast as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem, thus providing a formal framework for characterizing this optimization problem as well as the heuristics commonly used in its solution. One significant property of the proposed ILP model is that its size is polynomial in the size of the original circuit description.

Instead of them, a switch connected multiprocessor which uses a crossbar or Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs) for connecting processors and memory modules is a hopeful candidate. However, in such a system, a snoop cache technique in bus connected multiprocessors cannot be used, and consistency problems must be solved for providing the cache memory between a processor and the switch. To address this problem, hardware approaches by making the best use of advanced VLSI technology have been proposed. However, traditional methods require a large memory outside the switching element and it causes not only a large additional hardware but also the extra latency by accessing the outside memory. Moreover, the complicated MIN with cache or directory must also treat data packet which should be transferred quickly. In order to solve these problems, we proposed the MINC (MIN with Cache control mechanism). In the MINC, the MIN which only transfers a part of the address and cache coherent messages is separated from the data transfer network, and pushed into an LSI chip called the MINC chip. The coherent control is done based on the directory using the reduced Hierarchical Bit-map Directory scheme (RHBD). In order to reduce unnecessary packets, the pruning cache which is a small cache enough to implement inside the chip is introduced in the MINC chip","","0-7803-4425-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1998.669494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=669494","","Bandwidth;Cache memory;Delay;Hardware;Joining processes;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network servers;Switches;Very large scale integration;Workstations","cache storage;multistage interconnection networks;storage management chips","MIN;MINC;Multistage Interconnection Network;cache control;coherent control","","1","","3","","","10-13 Feb 1998","10 Feb 1998-13 Feb 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Companies are forced into rethinking ways to radically improve design productivity. Company presidents are issuing corporate wide edicts such as ""10x design process productivity improvement by 1998"". Re-engineering the design process is one of the alternatives that some companies have tried. They have architected and implemented integrated multi-vendor design environments. They have installed automated parts library and workflow management systems. They have re-organized into cross functional teams, and trained their engineers on new design methodologies and design automation best practices. The journey of managing significant process change has been a long and arduous one down a road full of potholes. Murphy's law, cultural inertia, politics, inexperience, underestimating, underfunding, lack of top management commitment, and more have conspired to grind projects to a halt.

Sleep transistor sizing is the key issue when MTCMOS circuit is designed. If the sleep transistor size is too large, the circuit performance can be maintained but the dynamic power consumption of the sleep transistor will increase. On the other hand, if the sleep transistor size is too small, there will be significant performance degradation because of the increased resistance to ground. Previous approach (Kao et al., 1998; Anis et al., 2002) designed the sleep transistor size based on mutual exclusive discharge patterns. However, these approaches considered only topology of a circuit. We observed that two possible simultaneous switching gates may not discharge at the same time in terms of functionality. Thus, we propose an algorithm to determine how to cluster cells to share sleep transistors taking both topology and functionality into consideration.

In this paper, we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global multiterminal nets given an existing buffer block plan. We give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999) [see also Albrecht (2000) and Dragan et al. (2000)].

In addition, our algorithm allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection and observes buffer parity constraints. Most importantly, and unlike previous works on the problem, we take into account multiterminal nets. Our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for the problem, which are based on 2-pin decompositions of the nets.

As a result, a significant (about 2 times) speed-up of the dynamic pipeline architecture with a slight hardware overhead relative to the sequential architecture has been achieved","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.759997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759997","","Color;Delay;FCC;Hardware;Pipeline processing;Printers;Printing;Throughput;Time factors;Very large scale integration","VLSI;fuzzy set theory;image colour analysis;image scanners;pipeline processing","color coordinates;dynamic pipelined VLSI architecture;fuzzy color correction;fuzzy subtree;input device;multimedia applications;output device;printer;scanner;speed requirement;state transition graphs;time-critical applications;unfixed latencies;variable iteration execution length","","0","","8","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The Y-architecture: yet another on-chip interconnect solution","Hongyu Chen; Bo Yao; Feng Zhou; Chung-Kuan Cheng","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., California Univ., San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Design Automation Conference, 2003. Proceedings of the ASP-DAC 2003. Asia and South Pacific","20030422","2003","","","840","846","In this paper, we propose a new on-chip interconnect scheme called Y-architecture, which can utilize the on-chip routing resources more efficiently than traditional Manhattan interconnect architecture by allowing wires routed in three directions (0Â°, 60Â°, and 120Â°). To evaluate the efficiency of different interconnect architectures, we assume mesh structures with uniform communication demand and develop a multi-commodity flow (MCF) approach to model the on-chip communication traffic. We also extend the combinatorial MCF algorithm of N. Garg and J. Konemann (Proc. 39th Annual Symp. on Foundations of Comp. Sci., pp. 300-309, 1998) to compute the optimal routing resource allocations for different interconnect architectures. The experiments show that: (1) compared with the Manhattan architecture, the Y-architecture demonstrates a throughput improvement of 30.7% for a square chip. The throughput of the Y-architecture is only 2.5% smaller than that of the X-architecture. (2) A chip with the shape of a convex polygon produces better throughput than a rectangular chip: For Y-architecture, a hexagonal chip provides 41% more throughput than a squared chip using the Manhattan architecture. For Manhattan architecture, a diamond chip achieves a throughput improvement of 19.5%, over the squared chip using the same interconnect architecture. (3) Compared with Manhattan architecture, the Y-architecture reduces the wire length of a randomly distributed two pin net by 13.4% and the average wire length of Y-architecture is only 4.3% more than that of the X-architecture.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195134","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Integrated circuit interconnections;Resource management;Routing;Shape;Throughput;Traffic control;Wires","circuit layout CAD;combinatorial mathematics;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit metallisation;network routing","Manhattan interconnect architecture;X-architecture;Y-architecture;combinatorial MCF algorithm;convex polygon chip;diamond chip;hexagonal chip;mesh structures;multi-commodity flow approach;on-chip communication traffic model;on-chip interconnect;on-chip routing resources;optimal routing resource allocations;randomly distributed two pin net;square chip;throughput improvement;uniform communication demand;wire length;wire routing directions","","8","1","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
