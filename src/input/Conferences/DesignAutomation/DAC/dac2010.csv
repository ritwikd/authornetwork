"Fast timing-model independent buffered clock-tree synthesis","Xin-Wei Shih; Yao-Wen Chang","Grad. Inst. of Electron. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","80","85","In high-performance synchronous chip design, a buffered clock tree with small clock skew is essential for improving clocking speed. Due to the insufficient accuracy of timing models for modern chip design, embedding simulation into a clock-tree synthesis flow becomes inevitable. Consequently, the runtime for clock-tree synthesis becomes prohibitively huge as the complexity of chip designs grows rapidly. To construct a buffered clock tree efficiently, we propose an ultra fast timing-model independent approach to perform skew minimization by structure optimization. To achieve the goal, a novel clock-tree structure, called symmetrical structure, is presented. At each level of a symmetrical clock tree, the number of branches, the wire-length, and the inserted buffers are almost the same. It is natural that the clock skew could be minimized if the configurations of all paths from the clock source to sinks are similar. By symmetrically constructing a clock tree, the clock skew can be minimized without referring to simulation information. Experimental results show that our approach can not only efficiently construct a buffered clock tree, but also effectively minimize clock skew with marginal wiring overheads. Based on a set of commonly used IBM benchmarks, for example, a state-of-the-art work without (with) ngspice simulation results in averagely 7.93X (2.77X) clock skew and requires 46X (24343X) runtime over our approach.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522359","","Accuracy;Chip scale packaging;Clocks;Computational modeling;Delay;Design engineering;Minimization;Runtime;Timing;Wiring","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reports device fabrication and modeling, as well as novel logic gate design using “laterally-actuated double-electrode NEMS” structures. The new device structure has several advantages over existing NEMS architectures such as being immune to impact bouncing and release vibrations (unlike a vertically-actuated NEMS) and offer higher flexibility to implement compact logic gates (unlike a single-electrode NEMS). A comprehensive analytical framework is developed to model different properties of these devices by solving the Euler-Bernoulli's beam equation. The proposed model is validated using measurement data for the fabricated devices. It is shown that by ignoring the non-uniformity of the electrostatic force distribution, the existing models “underestimate” the actual value of V<sub>pull-in</sub> and V<sub>pull-out</sub>. Furthermore, novel energy efficient NEMS-based circuit topologies are introduced to implement compact inverter, NAND, NOR and XOR gates. For instance, the proposed XOR gate can be implemented by using only two NEMS devices compared to that of a static CMOS-based XOR gate that requires at least 10 transistors.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523511","Energy-Efficient Electronics;Laterally-Actuated NEMS;Logic Design;Nano-Electro-Mechanical Switches;Process Variation;Steep-Subthreshold Switch","Differential equations;Electrostatic measurements;Energy efficiency;Fabrication;Logic design;Logic devices;Logic gates;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Nanoscale devices;Switches","beams (structures);logic gates;nanoelectromechanical devices;switches;vibrations","Euler-Bernoulli beam equation;NAND gates;NEMS based circuit;NOR gates;XOR gates;compact inverter;compact ultra energy efficient logic gates;impact bouncing;laterally actuated double electrode NEMS;nanoelectromechanical switches;release vibrations","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most previous studies focus on cores and on-chip memory subsystems and discuss how to reduce their power and control thermal distribution by using dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, the on-chip interconnection network, or network-on-chip (NoC), is also an important source of power consumption and heat generation. Particularly, the traffic flowing through the NoC affects directly its power and thermal distribution. Unfortunately, very few works discuss the dynamism of NoC. A key technique for NoC management is to capture its traffic patterns and predict future behaviors. In this paper, we propose a table-driven predictor called Network Traffic Prediction Table (NTPT) for recording and predicting traffic in NoC. The most unique feature of NTPT is its ability to predict end-to-end traffic, rather than switch-to-switch traffic. Thus, more application behaviors can be captured and monitored. Evaluations on Tilera's TILE64 show that NTPT has very high prediction accuracy. Analyses also show that it incurs a low area overhead and is very feasible.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523152","End-to-End Traffic Prediction;Many-core;Network-on-chip","Communication system traffic control;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Monitoring;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network-on-a-chip;Power generation;Telecommunication traffic;Voltage control","multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;power aware computing","NoC management;chip multiprocessors;end-to-end traffic prediction;network traffic prediction table;on-chip interconnection network;on-chip memory subsystems;on-chip networks;power distribution;thermal distribution","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These technologies exhibit appealing properties such as low power consumption, non-volatility, shock-resistivity, and high density. However, there are challenges to which we need answers in the road of applying non-volatile memories as main memory in computer systems. First, non-volatile memories have limited number of write/erase cycles compared with DRAM memory. Second, write activities on non-volatile memory are more expensive than DRAM memory in terms of energy consumption and access latency. Both challenges will benefit from reduction of the write activities on the nonvolatile memory. In this paper, we target embedded Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) with Scratch Pad Memory (SPM) and non-volatile main memory. We introduce data migration and recompu-tation techniques to reduce the number of write activities on non-volatile memories. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can reduce the number of writes by 59.41% on average, which means that the non-volatile memory can last 2.8 times as long as before. Meanwhile, the finish time of programs is reduced by 31.81% on average.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522764","CMP;Data migration;Data recomputation;Flash Memory;Non-volatile memory;Phase Change Memory;SPM","Computer science;Delay;Energy consumption;Memory management;Nonvolatile memory;Power engineering computing;Power system management;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Scanning probe microscopy","","","","12","3","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 3D ICs, it is essential to stack only good dies by testing the individual dies before stacking. For the clock signaling, the pre-bond testing requires a complete 2D clock tree on each die. The previous work enables the pre-bond testability by allocating specially designed resources called TSV-buffers and redundant trees with transmission gates. We proposes viable solutions to the two fundamental problems of the previous work: (1) using much less buffer resources by preventing (potentially `bad') TSV-buffers with a new tree topology generation algorithm; (2) completely removing the transmission gate control lines by using a specially designed component called self controlled clock transmission gate (SCCTG). Compared to the existing 3D tree topology generation algorithms, solution 1 can use 56%-88% less number of TSVs, 53%-67% less number of buffers, 22%-65% less total wirelength, and 26%-43% less clock power for the benchmark circuits with dense sink placements.

However, LTE physical layer involves dynamically varying data processing rates that make SDF insufficient due to its constant-rate constraint. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Mixed-mode Vector-based Dataflow (MVDF), to efficiently model and simulate LTE physical layer by exploring the matched-rate nature of LTE and by combining static and dynamic dataflow technologies. We have implemented MVDF in an ESL tool, called SystemVue, along with a complete LTE physical layer library.

Knowing open-circuit voltage (OCV) leads to SOC due to the well known mapping between OCV and SOC. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet accurate OCV algorithm that applies to all types of batteries. Using linear system analysis but without a circuit model, we calculate OCV based on the sampled terminal voltage and discharge current of the battery. Experiments show that our algorithm is numerically stable, robust to history dependent error, and obtains SOC with less than 4% error compared to a detailed battery simulation for a variety of batteries. Our OCV algorithm is also efficient, and can be used as a real-time electro-analytical tool revealing what is going on inside the battery.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523225","Battery;Circuit Analysis;State of Charge","Algorithm design and analysis;Battery charge measurement;Battery management systems;Circuits;Energy management;Energy storage;Estimation error;History;Robustness;Voltage","battery management systems","battery management;battery simulation;discharge current;open-circuit voltage (OCV);real-time electro-analytical tool;terminal voltage;time-variant circuit model;universal state-of-charge algorithm","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, it becomes convenient to translate an existent RTL IP description, originally dedicated to implement an HW component, into pure SW code (i.e., C/C++) to be executed by one or more processors of the MPSoC. This work proposes a methodology to automatically generate SW code by abstracting RTL IP models implemented in hardware description language (HDL).

In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel.

Choosing the appropriate L1 cache configuration necessitates the simulation of long memory access traces to accurately obtain hit/miss rates. The long execution time taken to simulate these traces, particularly separate simulation for each configuration is a major drawback. Researchers have proposed techniques to speed up the simulation of caches with LRU replacement policy. These techniques are of little use in the majority of embedded processors as these processors utilize Round-robin policy based caches. In this paper we propose a fast L1 cache simulation approach, called SCUD(Sorted Collection of Unique Data), for caches with the Round-robin policy. SCUD is a single-pass cache simulator that can simulate multiple L1 cache configurations (with varying set sizes and associativities) by reading the application trace once. Utilizing fast binary searches in a novel data structure, SCUD simulates an application trace significantly faster than a widely used single configuration cache simulator (Dinero IV). We show SCUD can simulate a set of cache configurations up to 57 times faster than Dinero IV. SCUD shows an average speed up of 19.34 times over Dinero IV for Mediabench applications, and an average speed up of over 10 times for SPEC CPU2000 applications.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522812","Cache simulation;L1 cache;Miss rate;Round robin;Simulation","Analytical models;Australia;Cache memory;Data structures;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Performance analysis;Permission;Process design;Round robin","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we specifically consider the problem of virtual channel (VC) allocation in application-specific NoCs. Prior solutions to this problem have been average-rate driven. However, average-rate models are poor representations of real application traffic, and can lead to designs that are poorly matched to the application. We propose an alternate trace-driven paradigm in which configuration of NoCs is driven by application traces. We propose two simple greedy trace-driven VC allocation schemes. Compared to uniform allocation, we observe up to 51% reduction in the number of VCs under a given average packet latency constraint, or up to 74% reduction in average packet latency with same number of VCs. Our results suggest that average-rate driven methods cannot effectively select appropriate links for VC allocation because they fail to consider the impact of traffic bursts. As a case study, we compare our proposed approach with an existing average-rate driven method and observe up to 35% reduction in the number of VCs for a given target latency.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523163","Networks-on-Chip;greedy heuristics;virtual channel","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Delay;Design optimization;Fabrics;Network-on-a-chip;Permission;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Virtual colonoscopy","channel allocation;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip;optimisation","application specific multicore designs;greedy trace driven VC allocation schemes;networks-on-chip configurations;packet latency constraint;router configurations;trace driven optimization;virtual channel allocation","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to predict future thermal behavior allows a thermal management system to optimize a processor's operation so as to prevent the on-set of high temperatures. In this paper we propose a new thermal prediction method that leads to consistent results between the thermal models used in prediction and observed thermal sensor measurements, and is capable of accurately predicting temperature behavior with heterogenous workload assignment on a multicore platform. We devise an off-line analysis algorithm that learns a set of thermal models as a function of operating frequency and globally defined workload phases. We incorporate these thermal models into a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique that limits the maximum temperature during runtime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system in predicting the thermal behavior of a real quad-core processor in response to different workloads.

To enhance the node-merging techniques on logic restructuring and optimization, we propose an NAR approach in this work. We first present two sufficient conditions that state the requirements of added nodes for safely replacing a target node. Then, an NAR approach is proposed to fast detect the added nodes by performing logic implications based on these conditions. We also apply the NAR approach to circuit minimization together with two techniques: redundancy removal and mandatory assignment reuse. We conduct experiments on a set of IWLS 2005 benchmarks.

When spatial correlation are strong (with large spatial correlation length), efficient linear time complexity analysis can be attained as the number of variational variables can be significantly reduced. However this is not the case for circuits where gate leakage currents are weakly correlated. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for statistical leakage power analysis in the presence of weak spatial correlation. The new algorithm exploits the fact that gate leakage current can be efficiently computed locally when correlation is weak. We adopt a newly proposed spatial correlation model where a new set of location-dependent uncorrelated variables are defined over virtual grids to represent the original physical random variables via fitting. To compute the leakage current of a gate on the new set of variables, the new method uses the orthogonal polynomials based collocation method, which can be applied to any gate leakage models. The total leakage currents are then computed by simply summing up the resulting orthogonal polynomials (their coefficients) on the new set of variables for all gates. Experimental results show that the proposed method is about two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed grid-based method [3] with similar accuracy and many orders of magnitude times over the Monte Carlo method.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523103","dynamic power;spatial correlation;statistical analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Gate leakage;Leakage current;Polynomials;Power dissipation;Principal component analysis;Random variables;Subthreshold current;Threshold voltage","","","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we describe an implementation of a statistical tuner using interior point nonlinear optimization with an objective function that is directly dependent on statistical process variation. Our results show that for process variation sensitive circuits, consisting of thousands of independently tunable devices, a statistically aware tuner can give more robust, higher yield solutions when compared to deterministic circuit tuning and is thus an attractive alternative to the Monte Carlo methods that are typically used to size devices in such circuits.

One of the major drawbacks of these works is that they ignore the effects of frequency-scaling on fault arrival rates. In this paper, we present a modified Primary-Backup model for dual-processor systems that aims to maintain the reliability when employing power management techniques to minimize the overall energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed approach exploits the uncertainties in the execution time of real-time tasks to better predict the available slack for energy management. The proposed modified PB-based Reliability-Aware Power Management (RAPM) approach was tested with synthetic task sets on both homogeneous and heterogeneous dual-processor systems. Simulation results show that it can achieve up to 67 % savings in expected energy consumption for low utilization task sets and up to 32 % savings for high utilization task sets without any loss in reliability in heterogeneous dual-processor systems.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523628","Dynamic Fault-Tolerance;Dynamic Power Management","Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency;Maintenance;Power system management;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Real time systems;Uncertainty","embedded systems;fault tolerance;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;power consumption;power engineering computing;reliability","dual-processor real-time embedded systems;energy consumption minimization;energy management;fault arrival rates;frequency-scaling;heterogeneous dual-processor systems;homogeneous dual-processor systems;primary-backup model;reliability aware power management","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an iterative design space exploration methodology exploiting the statistical properties of known system configurations to infer, by means of a correlation-based analysis, the next design points to be analyzed with low-level simulations. In fact, the knowledge of few design points is used to predict the expected improvement of unknown configurations. We show that the correlation of the configurations within the multi-processor design space can be modeled successfully with analytical functions and, thus, speed up the overall exploration phase.

As a result, “small-width” Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) can have a high probability of containing no semiconducting CNTs, resulting in CNFET failures. Upsizing these vulnerable small-width CNFETs is an expensive design choice since it can result in substantial area/power penalties. This paper introduces a processing/design co-optimization approach to reduce probability of CNFET failures at the chip-level. Large degree of spatial correlation observed in directional CNT growth presents a unique opportunity for such optimization. Maximum benefits from such correlation can be realized by enforcing the active regions of CNFETs to be aligned with each other. This approach relaxes the device-level failure probability requirement by 350X at the 45nm technology node, leading to significantly reduced costs associated with upsizing the small-width CNFETs.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523507","CNT;CNT Correlation;Carbon Nanotube;Yield Optimization","CMOS technology;CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;Chemicals;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Costs;Process design;Semiconductivity;Silicon","carbon nanotubes;field effect transistors;integrated circuit yield;probability","CNFET circuit yield enhancement;CNFET failure;CNT growth;carbon nanotube correlation;chemical synthesis;chip-level;design cooptimization;device-level failure probability;size 45 nm;small-width carbon nanotube field-effect transistor;spatial correlation","","5","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing solutions assume that the execution times of tasks performed on different processors are statistically independent, which ignores the spatial correlation characteristics for systematic variation. In addition, a unified task schedule is constructed at design stage and applied to all products with various variation effects, which restricts the maximum performance yield that can be achieved for MPSoC products. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present a novel quasi-static scheduling algorithm. Based on a more accurate performance yield estimation method, a set of variation-aware schedules is synthesized off-line and, at run time, the scheduler will select the right one based on the actual variation for each chip, such that the timing constraint can be satisfied whenever possible.

In this work we will present an error analysis technique that is able to efficiently calculate the number of critical bits needed to implement each LUT. We will perform this analysis using a scalable overlapping window-based method called DCOW (Don't-care Computation with Overlapping Windows), which allows for accurate and efficient don't-care lower bound calculations. This new windowing technique can approximate the complete don't cares within 2.34%, and can be used for many logic synthesis operations. In particular, we apply DCOW to our FPGA mapping algorithm to reduce the number of possible faults. This will allow the design to have a much higher success of functioning correctly when implemented on a faulty FPGA. By using our algorithm, we are able to reduce the number of possible faults by more than 12% with no area increase.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522779","Don't Cares;Error Analysis;FPGA Lookup Table;Logic Synthesis;Technology Mapping;Windowing","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit faults;Clocks;Electrical fault detection;Error analysis;Error correction;Fault detection;Field programmable gate arrays;Nanoscale devices;Table lookup","","","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A block-based STA algorithm is then applied to identify the longest path delay and shortest path delay change in different regions under bending. STAF plots maps that show “bending hot spots” which, when bended, significantly change the circuit timing. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the longest path delay can increase by up to 32% when a single region is bended. What is worse, the shortest path change can be up to 9%, which cannot be simply fixed by reduced clock speed.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

We present R2, an algorithm for rewiring a post-layout LUT-based circuit that reduces the overall criticality of the circuit, where criticality is the fraction of primary inputs that lead to observable errors at the primary outputs if an single event upset inverts a configuration bit. Our algorithm explicitly optimizes the robustness of the interconnect, the dominant component of FPGAs. The key idea of R2 is to exploit Boolean flexibilities in the circuit implementation to replace wires with high criticality with those with lower criticality while preserving the circuit functionality. We estimate criticalities using a Monte Carlo fault simulation. We represent flexibilities using SPFDs (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished), and use criticality information to choose candidates for rewiring, assigning the maximum flexibility to high criticality wires. Compared to IPR, a recent robust logic optimization, our implementation increases MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) by 24%, showing for the first time, the advantages of exploiting Boolean flexibilities in optimizing for robustness. In addition, R2 achieves 5% and 2% more reduction on the number of wires and LUTs in an FPGA than that obtained by the existing rewiring algorithm for area minimization.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523111","FPGA;Logic synthesis;Rewiring;SPFD;Soft Errors","Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Field programmable gate arrays;Flexible printed circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic;Monte Carlo methods;Robustness;Single event upset;Wires","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, design of reversible circuits attracted great attention in the last years. The number of circuit lines is thereby a major criterion since it e.g. affects the still limited resource of qubits. Nevertheless, all approaches introduced so far for synthesis of complex reversible circuits need a significant amount of additional circuit lines - sometimes orders of magnitude more than the primary inputs. In this paper, we propose a post-process optimization method that addresses this problem. The general idea is to merge garbage output lines with appropriate constant input lines. To this end, parts of the circuits are re-synthesized. Experimental results show that by applying the proposed approach, the number of circuit lines can be reduced by 17% on average - in the best case by more than 40%. At the same time, the increase in the number of gates and the quantum costs, respectively, can be kept small.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523384","Optimization;Quantum Computation;Reversible Logic","Boolean functions;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computer science;Data structures;Debugging;Logic design;Optimization methods;Quantum computing","circuit optimisation;logic design","circuit line;circuit re-synthesization;complex reversible circuit synthesis;post process optimization method;quantum computation;qubit resource;reversible logic","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The numerical algorithms with small computational cost yet superior convergence are highly desired to extend designers' creativity to probe those extremely challenging designs of RF/MM ICs. This paper presents a new shooting algorithm for periodic RF/MM-IC systems. Utilizing a periodic structure of the state matrix, a periodic Arnoldi shooting algorithm is developed to exploit the structured Krylov-subspace. This leads to an improved efficiency and convergence. Results from several industrial examples show that the proposed periodic Arnoldi shooting method, called PAS, is 1000 times faster than the direct-LU and the explicit GMRES methods.

This work proposes a novel voltage reduction technique to reduce SRAM leakage power during the standby mode. The design employs an implicit voltage reduction method that “stacks” SRAM banks in series while these blocks are inactive. No explicit DC/DC converters are required to achieve the reduced voltages, which leads to large area reductions over techniques requiring on-chip regulation circuits. This stacking technique reduces the voltage on each block close to the absolute data retention voltage (DRV) of each cell, and achieves a maximum leakage power reduction of 93% from the active power mode.

A major challenge with multi-core system design is the widening gap between the memory demand generated by the processor cores and the limited off-chip memory bandwidth and memory service speed. This severely restricts the number of cores that can be integrated into a multi-core system and the parallelism that can be actually achieved and efficiently exploited for not only memory demanding applications, but also for workloads consisting of many tasks utilizing a large number of cores and thus exceeding the available off-chip bandwidth. Last level shared cache partitioning has been shown to be a promising technique to enhance cache utilization and reduce missrates. While most cache partitioning techniques focus on cache miss rates, our work takes a different approach in which tasks' memory bandwidth requirements are taken into account when identifying a cache partitioning for multi-programmed and/or multithreaded workloads. Cache resources are allocated with the objective that the overall system bandwidth requirement is minimized for the target workload. The key insight is that cache miss-rate information may severely misrepresent the actual bandwidth demand of the task, which ultimately determines the overall system performance and power consumption.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522348","L2 Cache Partitioning;Off-Chip bandwidth reduction","Bandwidth;Educational institutions;Energy consumption;Hardware;Minimization methods;Multicore processing;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;System performance;Throughput","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To analyze unexpected behavior, silicon behavior is partitioned into two classes, one class containing instances of unexpected behavior and the other with rest of the population. Classification rule learning is applied to extract rules to explain why certain class of behavior occurs. We present a rule learning algorithm that analyzes test measurement data in terms of design features to generate rules, and conduct controlled experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed learning approach can effectively uncover rules responsible for the design-silicon mismatch even when significant noises are associated with both the measurement data and the class partitioning results for capturing the unexpected behavior.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523108","Data Mining;Delay Test;Learning;Timing Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Data analysis;Data mining;Manufacturing processes;Noise measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Predictive models;Process design;Silicon;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;semiconductor industry","classification rule learning;cross-domain attributes;design-silicon mismatch problem;subgroup discovery","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to identify segments of the failing speedpaths that have a post-silicon delay larger than their estimated delays at the pre-silicon stage. We refer to such segments as “failing segments” and we rank them according to their degree of failure. Diagnosis of failing segments alleviates the problem of lack of observability inside a path. Moreover, root-cause analysis, and post-silicon tuning or repair, can be done more effectively by focusing on the failing segments. We propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation to breakdown a path into a set of non-failing segments, leaving the remaining to be likely-failing ones.

"Scalable effort hardware design: Exploiting algorithmic resilience for energy efficiency","Chippa, V.K.; Mohapatra, D.; Raghunathan, A.; Roy, K.; Chakradhar, S.T.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","555","560","Algorithms from several interesting application domains exhibit the property of inherent resilience to “errors” from extrinsic or intrinsic sources, offering entirely new avenues for performance and power optimization by relaxing the conventional requirement of exact (numerical or Boolean) equivalence between the specification and hardware implementation. We propose scalable effort hardware design as an approach to tap the reservoir of algorithmic resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations. The basic tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended towards generation of the correct (exact) result, and expose them as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. A second major tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of algorithmic resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient SVM classification chip based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. We present results from post-layout simulations and demonstrate that scalable effort hardware can achieve large energy reductions (1.2X-2.2X with no impact on classification accuracy, and 2.2X-4.1X with modest reductions in accuracy) across various sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization leads to much improved energy vs. quality tradeoffs compared to each of the individual techniques.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523464","Approximate Computing;Low Power Design;Mining;Recognition;Scalable Effort;Support Vector Machines","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computer architecture;Design optimization;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Reservoirs;Resilience;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power aware computing;support vector machines","cross-layer optimization;energy efficiency;energy-efficient SVM classification chip;low power design;machine learning algorithm;scalable effort hardware design;support vector machines;synergistic cross-layer optimization","","14","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis (IFRA) is a promising post-silicon bug localization technique for complex processor cores. However, applying IFRA to new processor microarchitectures can be challenging due to the manual effort required to implement special microarchitecture-dependent analysis techniques for bug localization. This paper presents the Bug Localization Graph (BLoG) framework that enables application of IFRA to new processor microarchitectures with reduced manual effort. Results obtained from an industrial microarchitectural simulator modeling a state-of-the-art complex commercial microarchitecture (Intel Nehalem, the foundation for the Intel Core™ i7 and Core™ i5 processor families) demonstrate that BLoG-assisted IFRA enables effective and efficient post-silicon bug localization for complex processors with high bug localization accuracy at low cost.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523125","BLoG;IFRA;Silicon debug;post-silicon validation","Computer bugs;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Information services;Internet;Manuals;Microarchitecture;Permission;Web sites","microprocessor chips;security of data","IFRA technique;bug localization graphs;complex processor cores;instruction footprint recording and analysis;post-silicon bug localization;processor microarchitectures","","6","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information is typically generated using a combination of thermal sensor inputs and various estimation schemes such as Kalman filter. A basic assumption used by such schemes is that the statistical characteristics of the power consumption do not change. This is problematic since such characteristics are heavily application dependent. In this paper, we first present autonomous schemes for detecting the change in the statistical characteristics of power and then propose adaptive schemes for capturing such new statistical parameters dynamically. This could enable accurate temperature estimation during runtime given dynamically changing power statistical states.

We then formulate a simple nonlinear optimization problem which uncovers sequentially the most relevant directions in the combined deterministic-stochastic space. The complexity of our algorithm scales with the sum (rather than the product) of the sizes of the deterministic and stochastic spaces, hence it is orders of magnitude more efficient than many of the available state of the art techniques.

Proving that a false path is valid or not is a difficult problem because of the inherent computational cost, and because in practice false paths are not specified one full path at a time. Instead designers use generalized false paths, which represent a set of paths. For instance the SDC format (Synopsys Design Constraint) specifies false path exceptions using a “-from -through -to” syntax that applies on sets of pins, often using wildcards to denote these sets. This represents many (usually hundreds to thousands) actual full paths. This paper proposes a method to verify generalized false paths in a very efficient manner. It is shown to be about 10x faster than the current state-of-the-art, making false path verification an overnight task or less for multi-million gate designs.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522565","Formal verification;SAT;SDC;co-sensitization;correctness;false path;generalized false path;sensitization;timing exception","Added delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit faults;Computational efficiency;Libraries;Logic design;Pins;Propagation delay;Timing;Twitter","","","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The models are calibrated using ring oscillator frequency data obtained from an experimental test chip to verify their accuracy. Results indicate that the models accurately capture the layout dependence of stress and carrier mobility for a variety of layout permutations and the root mean square error in the predicted ring oscillator frequency is less than 1% for the different layout experiments.

It is a key step in the IC applications regarding cryptography, security, and digital rights management. However, GLC is challenging due to the existence of manufacturing variability (MV) and the strong correlations among some gates in the circuit. We propose a new solution for GLC by using thermal conditioning techniques. In particular, we apply thermal control on the process of GLC, which breaks the correlations by imposing extra variations concerning gate level leakage power. The scaling factors of all the gates can be characterized by solving a system of linear equations using linear programming (LP). Based on the obtained gate level scaling factors, we demonstrate an application of GLC, hardware Trojan horse (HTH) detection, by using constraint manipulation. We evaluate our approach of GLC and HTH detection on several ISCAS85/89 benchmarks. The simulation results show that our thermally conditioned GLC approach is capable of characterizing all the gates with an average error less than the measurement error, and we can detect HTHs with 100% accuracy on a target circuit.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522644","Gate-level characterization;hardware Trojan horse;manufacturing variability;thermal conditioning","Application specific integrated circuits;Cryptography;Digital integrated circuits;Equations;Hardware;Invasive software;Linear programming;Manufacturing;Process control;Security","","","","9","5","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Large groups of cells that are highly interconnected to each other can often create potential routing hotspots that require special placement constraints. They can also indicate problematic clumps of logic that either require resynthesis to reduce wiring demand or specialized datapath placement. At a glance, this formulation appears similar to conventional circuit clustering, but there are two important distinctions. First, we are interested in finding large groups of cells that represent entire logic structures like adders and decoders, as opposed to clusters with only a handful of cells. Second, we seek to pull out only the structures of interest, instead of assigning every cell to a cluster to reduce problem complexity. This work proposes new metrics for detecting structures based on Rent's rule that, unlike traditional cluster metrics, are able to fairly differentiate between large and small groups of cells. Next, we demonstrate how these metrics can be applied to identify structures in a netlist.

DPL attempts to decompose a single layer of one layout into two masks in order to increase pitch size and improve depth of focus (DOF). Considering DPL at detailed routing stage can improve the flexibility of layout decomposition as compared to the post-routing layout decomposition. The conflict graph proposed in [8] provides a global view of all nets in a layout to obtain a highly decomposable layout with less yield loss. However, adopting conflict graph in routing process using grid-based model or gridless model both brings huge overhead. This work presents an innovative conflict graph (ICG) to realize adopting conflict graph in a routing process. Three routing-friendly characteristics of ICG are constant-time conflict cycle detection, lazy ICG update, and light-weight routing overhead. To efficiently utilize routing resources for a crowded region, gridless models provide a better solution space than grid-based models do. This work also develops, to our knowledge, the first DPL-aware gridless detailed routing with ICG to generate a highly decomposable routing result. Moreover, greedily assigning colors for routed nets may cause unnecessary stitches or even a coloring conflict. This work presents a deferred coloring assignment-based routing flow to escape local optimum of a greedy coloring approach. Experimental results indicate that DPL-aware routing results contain no coloring conflicts, and the stitches produced by the proposed router are less than those produced by a greedy coloring approach by 41% on average with only 0.22% and 30% increment in wirelength and runtime, respectively.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523171","Detailed Routing;Double Patterning;Gridless Model","Computer science;Delay;Design optimization;Impedance;Lithography;Mesh generation;Page description languages;Routing;Ultraviolet sources;Very large scale integration","graph colouring;greedy algorithms;lithography","coloring assignment-based routing flow;constant-time conflict cycle detection;decomposable routing;depth of focus;double patterning lithography;greedy coloring;gridless detailed routing;innovative conflict graph;layout decomposition;lazy ICG update;light-weight routing overhead;next generation lithography;pitch size;recurrent delay;routing resources;routing-friendly characteristics","","4","2","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the application-specific communication patterns, we propose a scalable algorithm using global optimization to eliminate as much channel dependency cycles as possible while ensuring shortest paths between heavily communicated nodes, and split only the remaining small set of cycles (if any). Experimental results show that compared to prior work, ACES can either reduce the NoC power by 11%~35% while maintaining approximately the same network performance, or improve the network performance by 10%~36% with slight NoC power overhead (-5%~7%) on a wide range of examples.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523151","Application-specific;Deadlock-free routing;Network-on-Chip","Computer science;Design optimization;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Power system interconnection;Radio frequency;Routing;System recovery","network routing;network-on-chip;optimisation","ACES method;MPSoC designs;application-specific cycle elimination and splitting;application-specific network-on-chip;deadlock-free routing;global optimization;multiprocessing system-on-chip","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is widely considered to be a very challenging problem due to the difficulty of parallel programming and the bottlenecks to efficient parallel execution. Inspired by how networking and storage systems have scaled to handle very large volumes of packet traffic and persistent data, we propose a new approach to the design of scalable, parallel computing platforms. For decades, computing platforms have gone to great lengths to ensure that every computation specified by applications is faithfully executed. While this design philosophy has remained largely unchanged, applications and the basic characteristics of their workloads have changed considerably. A wide range of existing and emerging computing workloads have an inherent forgiving nature. We therefore argue that adopting a best-effort service model for various software and hardware components of the computing platform stack can lead to drastic improvements in scalability. Applications are cognizant of the best-effort model, and separate their computations into those that may be executed on a best-effort basis and those that require the traditional execution guarantees. Best-effort computations may be exploited to simply reduce the computing workload, shape it to be more suitable for parallel execution, or execute it on unreliable hardware components. Guaranteed computations are realized either through an overlay software layer on top of the best-effort substrate, or through the use of application-specific strategies. We describe a system architecture for a best-effort computing platform, provide examples of parallel software and hardware that embody the best-effort model, and show that large improvements in performance and energy efficiency are possible through the adoption of this approach.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522827","Best effort systems;multi core;parallel computing;performance;scalability","Application software;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Scalability;Shape;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","1","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A framework for optimizing thermoelectric active cooling systems","Jieyi Long; Memik, S.O.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","591","596","Thin-film thermoelectric cooling is a promising technology for mitigating heat dissipation in high performance chips. In this paper, we present an optimization framework for an active cooling system that is comprised of an array of thin-film thermoelectric coolers. We observe a set of constraints of the cooling system design. Firstly, integrating an excessive amount of coolers increases the chip package cost. Moreover, thermoelectric coolers are active devices, which dissipate heat in the chip package when they are in operation. Hence, setting the supply current level to operate the cooler improperly can actually lead to overheating of the chip package. Besides, the supply current needs to be delivered to the integrated cooler devices via dedicated pins. However, extra pins available on high-performance chip packages are limited. Observing these constraints, we propose an optimization framework for configuring the active cooling system, which minimizes the maximum silicon temperature. This includes determining the amount of coolers to deploy and their locations, the mapping of supply pins to the coolers, and determining the current levels of each pin. We propose algorithms to tackle the optimal configuration problem. We found that only a small portion of the silicon die needs to be covered by TEC devices (18% on average). Our experiments show that our algorithms are able to reduce the temperatures of the hot spots by as much as 10.6°C (compared to the cases without integrated thermoelectric coolers). The average temperature reduction is 8.6°C when 4 dedicated pins are available on the package. The total power consumption of the resulting active cooling system is reasonably small (~2 W). Our experiments also reveal that our framework maximizes the efficiency of the cooling devices. In the ideal case where hundreds of pins are available to tune the supply level of each individual cooler, the additional average reduction of the hot spot temperature is o- - nly 0.3°C.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523429","Optimization;Thermal runaway;Thermoelectric cooling","Cooling;Costs;Current supplies;Packaging;Pins;Silicon;Temperature;Thermoelectric devices;Thermoelectricity;Transistors","cooling;integrated circuit design;thermoelectric devices","chip package cost;heat dissipation;high-performance chip packages;hot spot temperature;maximum silicon temperature;optimal configuration problem;optimization framework;power consumption;supply current level;thermoelectric active cooling systems;thin-film thermoelectric cooling","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework has a low cost agent residing in each core that observes the local workload and temperature and communicates with its nearest neighbor for task migration/exchange. By choosing only those migration requests that will result balanced workload without generating thermal emergency, the proposed framework maintains workload balance across the system and avoids unnecessary migration.

In typical implementations, the finite precision information is only known after fixed-point refinement, once the data-flow has been frozen. Instead, in this paper we suggest the propagation of finite precision information to drive data-flow transformations in order to achieve a higher mapping efficiency. Then, provided a flexible architecture with low run-time switching overhead, the data-flow under execution can opportunistically be tuned to provide the instantaneous computational accuracy required by the application. Thereby, the average number of operations and the precision of those is minimized. This principle is demonstrated with the implementation of the 128-point FFT present in a WLAN receiver. Compared to a conventional implementation, a reduction of 49% to 65% of the number of cycles can be achieved depending on conditions external to the receiver.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523343","ASIP;Finite Precision;Mapping Efficiency","Computer architecture;Electronic design automation and methodology;Energy efficiency;Parallel processing;Permission;Runtime;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Very large scale integration;Wireless LAN","data flow analysis;data flow computing","data flow transformations;data-flow mapping;finite precision information;fixed point refinement;run time switching","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, many systems built from these technologies operate imperfectly.

In addition, there is emerging a body of mathematical analysis related to imperfect computation.

Improving the cache hit rate can have significant positive impact on the performance of an application. Modern embedded processors often feature cache locking mechanisms that allow memory blocks to be locked in the cache under software control. Cache locking was primarily designed to offer timing predictability for hard real-time applications. Hence, the compiler optimization techniques focus on employing cache locking to improve worst-case execution time. However, cache locking can be quite effective in improving the average-case execution time of general embedded applications as well. In this paper, we explore static instruction cache locking to improve average-case program performance. We introduce temporal reuse profile to accurately and efficiently model the cost and benefit of locking memory blocks in the cache. We propose an optimal algorithm and a heuristic approach that use the temporal reuse profile to determine the most beneficial memory blocks to be locked in the cache. Experimental results show that locking heuristic achieves close to optimal results and can improve the cache miss rate by up to 24% across a suite of real-world benchmarks. Moreover, our heuristic provides significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art locking algorithm both in terms of performance and efficiency.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522664","Cache;Cache Locking;Temporal Reuse Profile","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer aided instruction;Delay;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Embedded system;Optimizing compilers;Permission;Timing","cache storage;embedded systems;optimisation;program compilers;tree searching","compiler optimization techniques;embedded systems;instruction cache locking mechanism;memory access latency;software control;temporal reuse profile","","4","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first introduce the concept of effective rank to select a small set of representative paths to predict the target paths with high accuracy. To handle the large dimension and degree of independent random parameter variations, we then allow modeling target path delays using segment delays and formulate it as a convex problem. The identification of segments can be incorporated in design of custom test structures to monitor PS circuit timing behavior.

Extensively reusing the SRAM peripheral circuitry minimizes control logic overhead. Sensing overhead is further amortized as the sensors can be both reconfigured and recycled as functional SRAM cells, potentially increasing SRAM yield when other bit cells fail due to initial process variation or long time aging effects. The paper also proposes a variation-aware sensor system design methodology by quantifying and leveraging the tradeoff between the size and number of sensors and the system sensing precision.

The proposed sequential global router, which adopts a heuristic-BLMR, identifies less-wirelength routing results with less runtime than state-of-the-art global routers. This study also proposes a parallel multi-threaded collision-aware global router based on a previous sequential global router. Unlike the conventional partition-based concurrency strategy, the proposed algorithm uses a task-based concurrency strategy. Experimental results reveal that the proposed sequential global router uses less wirelength and runs about 1.9X to 18.67X faster than other state-of-the-art global routers.

We propose a systematic composable approach for the performance modeling of a recently developed hierarchical multi-algorithm parallel circuit simulation (HMAPS) approach. The unique integration of inter- and intra-algorithm parallelisms allows a multiplicity of parallelisms to be exploited in HMAPS and also creates interesting modeling challenges in forms of complex performance tradeoffs and large runtime configuration space. We model the performances of key subtask entities as functions of workload and parallelism. We address significant complications introduced by inter-algorithm interactions in terms of memory contention and collaborative simulation behavior via novel penalty and statistical based modeling.

In this paper, we propose a runtime adaptive application scheduling scheme that efficiently distributes the runtime slack in a task graph, to achieve maximized performance under timing and dynamic/leakage energy constraints. A guided-search heuristics is proposed to select the best-fit frequency levels that maximize the additional program cycles of adaptive tasks.

An ELL-like sparse matrix data structure is adopted and implemented specifically for power grid analysis to assure coalesced GPU device memory access and high arithmetic intensity. By combining the fast geometrical multigrid solver with the robust Krylov-subspace iterative solver, power grid DC and transient analysis can be performed efficiently on GPU without loss of accuracy (largest errors <; 0.5 mV). Unlike previous GPU-based algorithms that rely on good power grid regularities, the proposed algorithm can be applied for more general power grid structures.

CE is an advanced optimization framework which explores the power of rare-event probability theory and importance sampling. To achieve high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross entropy (SCE) algorithm is proposed which integrates CE with a partitioning-based sampling strategy to effectively reduce the dimensionality in solving the large scale decap budgeting problems. Extensive experiments on industrial power grid benchmarks show that the proposed SCE method converges 2X faster than the prior methods and 10X faster than the standard CE method, while gaining up to 25% improvement on power grid supply noise. Importantly, the proposed SCE algorithm is parallel-friendly since the simulation samples of each SCE iteration can be independently obtained in parallel.

Since TSV fill material and silicon have different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), TSV causes silicon deformation due to different temperatures at chip manufacturing and operating. The widely used TSV fill material is copper which causes tensile stress on silicon near TSV. In this paper, we propose systematic TSV stress aware timing analysis and show how to optimize layout for better performance. First, we generate a stress contour map with an analytical radial stress model. Then, the tensile stress is converted to hole and electron mobility variations depending on geometric relation between TSVs and transistors. Mobility variation aware cell library and netlist are generated and incorporated in an industrial timing engine for 3D-IC timing analysis. It is interesting to observe that rise and fall time react differently to stress and relative locations with respect to TSVs. Overall, TSV stress induced timing variations can be as much as ±10% for an individual cell. Thus as an application for layout optimization, we can exploit the stress-induced mobility enhancement to improve timing on critical cells. We show that stress-aware perturbation could reduce cell delay by up to 14.0% and critical path delay by 6.5% in our test case.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523613","3DIC;TSV;mobility variation;stress;timing analysis","Delay;Geometry;Silicon;Stacking;Tensile stress;Thermal expansion;Thermal stresses;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Through-silicon vias;Timing","electron mobility;integrated circuit layout;thermal expansion;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D wafer stacking;3D-IC layout optimization;3D-IC timing analysis;SOC integration;analytical radial stress model;chip manufacturing;coefficients of thermal expansion;copper;electron mobility variation;geometry shrinking;industrial timing engine;mobility variation aware cell library;netlist;silicon deformation;stress contour map;stress-aware perturbation;stress-induced mobility enhancement;tensile stress;through silicon via stress aware timing analysis;transistors","","16","2","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the direct mapping from pixels to ISPs, the overall yield relies heavily on the correctness of the ubumps, ADCs and TSVs - a single defect leads to the information loss of a tile of pixels. This paper presents an error tolerance scheme for the 3D CMOS imager that can still deliver high quality images in the presence of μbump, ADC, and/or TSV failures. The error tolerance is achieved by properly interleaving the connections from pixels to ADCs so that the corrupted data, if any, can be recovered in the ISPs. A key design parameter, the interleaving stride, is decided by analyzing the employed error correction algorithm.

Such cost-sensitive domains require tight estimation of timing properties of the generated code. Towards this goal, we propose a scheme for generating C code from Esterel specifications for a multiprocessor platform, followed by timing analysis of the generated code. Due to dependencies across program fragments mapped onto different processors, traditional Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis techniques for sequential programs cannot applied be to this setting. Our proposed timing analysis technique is tailored to capture such inter-processor code dependencies.

Thermal hot spots increase leakage, deteriorate timing, and reduce the mean time to failure. To manage runtime thermal variations, circuit designers embed within-die thermal sensors that acquire temperatures at few selected locations. The acquired temperatures are then used to guide runtime thermal management techniques. The capabilities of these techniques are essentially bounded by the spatial thermal resolution of the sensor measurements. In this paper we characterize temperature signals of real processors and demonstrate that on-chip thermal gradients lead to sparse signals in the frequency domain. We exploit this observation to (1) devise thermal sensor allocation techniques, and (2) devise signal reconstruction techniques that fully characterize the thermal status of the processor using the limited number of measurements from the thermal sensors. To verify the accuracy of our methods, we compare our temperature characterization results against thermal measurements acquired from a state-of-the-art infrared camera that captures the mid-band infrared emissions from the back of the die of a 45 nm dual-core processor.

A fast behavior-level Monte Carlo simulation is also proposed to shorten the iterative yield enhancement flow. Finally, using the obtained behavioral parameters as the sizing targets of each sub-block, the device sizing time is significantly reduced instead of sizing from the system-level specifications directly.

However, routing is greatly affected by placement results. If modules with input or output ports are placed arbitrarily in a symmetry island, the routing wires, which connect these modules with other modules outside the island, may induce unwanted parasitics coupling to signals, and thus circuit performance is deteriorated. This phenomenon can not be identified by a cost function, which only considers placement area and total wire length. Therefore, we would like to introduce the necessity of considering boundary constraint for the modules with input or output ports in symmetry islands. Based on ASF-B* tree [3], we explore the feasible conditions for 1D and 2D symmetry islands to meet this constraint. Further, a procedure is presented to maintain the feasibility for each ASF-B* tree after perturbation.

The problem to select those gates while integrity of circuit behavior remains intact has not been solved yet. We identify three constraints to solve this problem, namely functional, timing, and current constraints. The problem of synthesizing AMPG circuits is then laid out, and synthesis algorithm is proposed; a group of gates that can be power-gated by each clock-gating signal and the size of footer that is attached to the group constitute a synthesis output. The layout methodology for standard cell designs is proposed to assess AMPG circuits in area and wirelength.

In this paper, we propose a voltage scaling technique, named PreDVS, which assigns voltage levels based on the task set's preemptive scheduling for hard real-time systems. Our approach is based on an approximation scheme hence can guarantee to generate solutions within a specified quality bound (e.g., within 1% of the optimal) and is different from any existing inter- or intra-task DVS techniques. PreDVS exploits static time slack at a finer granularity and achieves more energy saving than inter-task scaling without introducing any extra voltage switching overhead. Moreover, it can be efficiently employed together with existing intra-task scaling techniques.

Decisions made at various levels of the design hierarchy affect the global figures of merit (FoMs) of an SRAM, such as, performance, power, area, and yield. However, the lack of a quick mechanism to understand the impact of changes at various levels of the hierarchy on global FoMs makes an accurate assessment of SRAM design innovations difficult. Thus, we introduce Virtual Prototyper (ViPro), a tool that helps SRAM designers explore the large design space by rapidly generating optimized virtual prototypes of complete SRAM macros. It does so by allowing designers to describe the SRAM components with varying levels of detail and by incorporating them into a hierarchical model that captures circuit and architectural features of the SRAM to optimize a complete prototype. It generates base-case prototypes that provide starting points for design space exploration, and assesses the impact of process, circuit, and architectural changes on the overall SRAM macro design.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522349","SRAM;Virtual prototype;design space exploration;iterative design;optimization","Circuit topology;Design optimization;Process design;Productivity;Prototypes;Random access memory;Space exploration;Space technology;Technological innovation;Virtual prototyping","","","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They manifest themselves as variations in performance, power consumption, and reduction in reliability in the manufactured chips as well as low yield levels. Their implications on performance and yield are particularly profound on 3D architectures: a defect on even a single layer can render the entire stack useless. In this paper, we show that instead of causing increased yield losses, we can actually exploit 3D technology to reduce yield losses by intelligently devising the architectures. We take advantage of the layer-to-layer variations to reduce yield losses by splitting critical components among multiple layers. Our results indicate that our proposed method achieves a 30.6% lower yield loss rate compared to the same pipeline implemented on a 2D architecture.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522719","3D Integration;Cache Architectures;Process Variations;Processor Pipeline","Bonding;Delay;Energy consumption;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit reliability;Integrated circuit technology;Manufacturing;Microarchitecture;Pipelines;Stacking","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce the pulsed-latch aware placement problem for timing integrity and present a unified placement framework to tackle this problem. Our new placer has the following distinguished features: (1) a multilevel pulsed-latch aware analytical placement framework to effectively prevent the potential pulse-width distortion problem, (2) a physical-information aware latch grouping algorithm to identify each desired group of a pulse generator and pulsed latches, and (3) a new optimization gradient for global placement to consider the impact of load capacitance of generators.

For resource access based on a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol, we analyze the worst-case completion time for a superblock, derive worst-case response times for tasks and obtain the relation of schedulability between different models.

Meanwhile, network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a promising and scalable solution for interconnecting the cores in CMPs, however it consumes significant portion of the total die area. In this paper, we propose to decouple the interconnect fabric from computing and storage layers, forming a separate layer called Interconnect Service Layer (ISL), in the context of three-dimensional (3D) chip integration. Such decoupling helps reduce the die area for each layer in 3D stacking. ISL itself can integrate multiple superimposed interconnect topologies. More importantly, ISL can be designed, manufactured, and tested as a separate Intellectual Property (IP) component, which supports multiple designs in the computing and storage layers. The resulting methodology also helps support different manufacturing volume in each die of 3D to reduce the overall manufacturing cost. We demonstrate the proposed methodology with an ISL design example and compare to its 2D and 3D counterparts without ISL support. The results show that 3D design with ISL not only provides significant cost reduction, but also achieves power-performance improvement thanks to the efficient usage of ISL.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522695","Interconnect Service Layer;Network-on-Chip;Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit","Cache memory;Cache storage;Computer aided manufacturing;Costs;Fabrics;Laboratories;Network-on-a-chip;Stacking;Sun;Through-silicon vias","","","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To expose more parallelism, we implemented a conservative parallel simulation approach, the CMB algorithm, on NVidia GPUs. The simulation processing is mapped to GPU hardware at the finest granularity. With carefully designed data structures and data flow organizations, our GPU based simulator could overcome many problems that hindered efficient implementations of the CMB algorithm on traditional parallel computers. In order to efficiently use the relatively limited capacity of GPU memory, a novel memory management mechanism was proposed to dynamically allocate and recycle GPU memory during simulation. We also introduced a CPU/GPU co-processing strategy for the best usage of computing resources.

Emulation supports in-system testing using real input and output. We previously showed emulation speed to be competitive with SystemC simulations on a PC when the emulator uses acceleration engines. A limit on the number of acceleration engines that can fit on an emulation platform creates new online problems involving runtime decisions as to when to load a SystemC process into an acceleration engine. We define the online SystemC emulation acceleration problem. In contrast to previous works that focus on statically improving SystemC (and the more general event-driven) simulations, we utilize online heuristics to manage the use of a limited number of SystemC acceleration engines in an emulation framework, where the kernel must adapt and react to dynamically changing process and event queues. We test several online heuristics and show 9x improvement over microprocessor-only emulation and 5x over statically preloaded acceleration engines. We further improve emulation performance by 10-20% by adding kernel bypass connections between acceleration engines and by adapting the online heuristics to make use of those connections.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523472","Bytecode;Emulation;Online Algorithms;Simulation;SystemC;Virtual Machines","Acceleration;Circuit synthesis;Emulation;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Image processing;Kernel;Personal communication networks;Runtime;Testing","field programmable gate arrays;simulation languages","acceleration engines;field-programmable gate arrays;in-system testing;kernel bypass connection;microprocessor-only emulation;online SystemC emulation acceleration problem;online heuristics","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although aggressive V<sub>DD</sub> scaling causes severe throughput degradation, this can be compensated by the nature of massive parallelism in the Xetal family. The predecessor of Xetal-Pro, Xetal-II, includes a large on-chip frame memory (FM), which cannot operate reliably at ultra low voltage. Therefore we investigate both different FM realizations and memory organization alternatives.

These electrical characteristics of memristors are mainly determined by the material characteristic and the fabrication process. For example, process variations may cause the deviation of the actual electrical behavior of memristors from the original design and result in the malfunction of the device. Therefore, it is very important to understand and characterize the impact of process variations on the electrical behaviors of the memristor and its implication to the circuit design. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the geometry variations on the electrical characteristics of the memristor. Two parameters - NARD (Normalized Accumulative Resistance Deviation) and NAARD (Normalized Accumulative Absolute Resistance Deviation), are introduced to measure the fluctuation of the overall internal state (or the resistance) of a memristor under the impact of process variations.

"New model-driven design and generation of multi-facet arbiters part I: From the design model to the architecture model","Jer Min Jou; Sih-Sian Wu; Yun-Lung Lee; Cheng Chou; Yuan-Long Jeang","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Cheng Kung Univ., Tainan, Taiwan","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","258","261","Designing of arbiters has become increasingly important because of their wide use in such as multi-processor system-on-a-chips (MPSoCs) and on- or off- chip high-speed cross-bar switches and networks. In this and an accompanying paper [6], we proposed a new systematic model-driven flow for design of the proposed new scalable multi-facet arbiters through a 3-phase process combined with the template-based modular design approach: the design model derivation phase, the architecture model (or template) design phase as well as arbiter hardware implementation and generation phase. Here, we described the phase 1 of the design flow of how to induce an arbiter design model in detail by careful analysis of arbiter design issues and systematic design space exploring the construction of the model. Then, we continue to discuss the phase 2 of how to derive an architecture model or template using the reusability, modularity and expansibility techniques. With both the design and architecture models, designers can easily design or at least understand and thus choose many kinds of different but better arbiters efficiently. The phase 3 is described in the accompanying paper [6]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a systematic model-driven design approach is proposed for the practical hardware design.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523355","Model-driven design flow;architecture model/template;design model;design space;granularity;multi-facet arbiter","Algorithm design and analysis;Arithmetic;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Computer science;Design engineering;Hardware;Space exploration;Switches;System-on-a-chip","asynchronous circuits;logic design","arbiter hardware generation phase;arbiter hardware implementation phase;architecture model;architecture model design phase;design model;design model derivation phase;expansibility technique;model-driven design;modularity technique;multifacet arbiter generation;multiprocessor system-on-a-chips;reusability technique;template-based modular design approach","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A multilayer nanophotonic interconnection network for on-chip many-core communications","Xiang Zhang; Louri, A.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","156","161","Multi-core chips or chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are becoming the de facto architecture for scaling up performance and taking advantage of the increasing transistor count on the chip within reasonable power consumption levels. The projected increase in the number of cores in future CMPs is putting stringent demands on the design of the on-chip network (or network-on-chip, NOC). Nanophotonic interconnects have recently emerged as a viable alternate technology solution for the design of NOC because of their higher communication bandwidth, much reduced power consumption and wiring simplification. Several photonic NOC approaches have recently been proposed. A common feature of almost all of these approaches is the integration of the entire optical network onto a single silicon waveguide layer. However, keeping the entire network on a single layer has a serious implication for power losses and design complexity due to the large amount of waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose MPNOC: a multilayer photonic networks-on-chip. MP-NOC combines the recent advances in silicon photonics and three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology with architectural innovations in an integrated architecture that provides ample bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficient on-chip communications for future CMPs. Simulation results show MPNOC can achieve 81.92 TFLOP/s peak bandwidth and an energy savings up to 23% compared to other proposed planar photonic NOC architectures.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522707","3D;CMP;Interconnection networks;Silicon photonics","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network-on-a-chip;Nonhomogeneous media;Optical fiber networks;Optical losses;Optical waveguides;Silicon;Wiring","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
