"Checking architectural outputs instruction-by-instruction on acceleration platforms","Chatterjee, D.; Koyfman, A.; Morad, R.; Ziv, A.; Bertacco, V.","Univ. of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2012 49th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20120719","2012","","","955","961","Simulation-based verification is an integral part of a modern microprocessor's design effort. Commonly, several checking techniques are deployed alongside the simulator to detect and localize each functional bug manifestation. Among these, a widespread technique entails comparing a microprocessor design's outputs with a golden model at the architectural granularity, instruction-by-instruction. However, due to exponential growth in design complexity, the performance of software-based simulation falls far short of achieving an acceptable level of coverage, which typically requires billions of simulation cycles. Hence, verification engineers rely on simulation acceleration platforms. Unfortunately, the intrinsic characteristics of these platforms make the adoption of the checking solutions mentioned above a challenging goal: for instance, the lockstep execution of a software checker together with the design's simulation is no longer feasible. To address this challenge we propose an innovative solution for instruction-by-instruction (IBI) checking tailored to acceleration platforms. We provide novel design techniques to decouple event tracing from checking by including specialized tracing logic and by adding a post-simulation checking phase. Note that simulation performance in acceleration platforms degrades when increasing the number of signals that are traced; hence, it is imperative to generate a compact summary of the information required for checking, collecting and tracing only a few bits of information per cycle.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241619","Checking;Checking on Acceleration;Simulation Acceleration","Acceleration;Hardware;Microprocessors;Registers;Software;Vectors","formal verification;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;program debugging;program diagnostics","IBI checking;acceleration platforms;architectural granularity;architectural outputs checking;design complexity;event tracing decoupling;exponential growth;functional bug manifestation;instruction-by-instruction;lockstep execution;microprocessor design;post-simulation checking phase;simulation acceleration platforms;simulation cycles;simulation-based verification;software checker;software-based simulation;specialized tracing logic;verification engineers","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method is based on an observation that a single Turing-complete instruction can mirror the semantics of any other instruction. One such instruction is the subleq instruction, which has been used for instructional purposes in the past. We find that the scope for using such a Turing-complete instruction is far greater, and in this paper, we present its applicability to fault tolerance. In particular, we extend a MIPS processor with a co-processor (called ultra-reduced instruction set co-processor - URISC) that implements the subleq instruction. We use the URISC to execute sequences of subleq that are semanti-cally equivalent to the faulty instructions. We formally prove this, and implement the translations in the back-end of the LLVM compiler. We generate binaries for our hardware prototype called MIPS-URISC, which we synthesize and execute on an Altera FPGA.

The speed and power consumption trade-off clearly appears as a prominent challenge to optimize the overall energy efficiency.

This requires monitoring accurately, on-chip and at runtime, the supply voltage and temperature across the die. Within this context, this paper introduces a method to estimate, from on-chip measurements, using embedded statistical tests, the supply voltage and temperature of small die area using low-cost digital sensors featuring a set of ring oscillators solely.

The intuition is that components in a layout-friendly netlist (e.g., a mesh) can spread over the layout region without introducing long interconnects. We propose a semidefinite programming relaxation to allow efficient estimation of spreading score, and use it in a high-level synthesis tool. On a number of test cases, a normalized spreading score shows a stronger bias in favor of interconnect structures that have better timing after layout, compared to the widely used metric of total multiplexer inputs.

Symmetry constraints are specified to route matched nets symmetrically with respect to some common axes. Topology-matching constraints are commonly imposed on critical yet asymmetry nets with the same number of bends, vias, and wirelength. Length-matching constraints are specified to route the nets which have limited resources with the same wirelength. These three constraints can reduce current mismatches and unwanted electrical effects between two critical nets. In this paper, we propose the first work to simultaneously consider the three constraints for analog routing while minimizing total wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise at the same time. We first present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to simultaneously consider the three constraints for analog routing, and employ effective reduction techniques to further reduce the numbers of ILP variables and constraints.

The cloud solves the masked instance and the client unmasks the generated solution. No approximations are involved in this process. The masked instance is shown to be substantially more immune to various introduced attacks. Otherwise layout statistics and even detailed connectivity information can easily be deciphered.

For applications related to human senses, approximate arithmetic can be used to generate sufficient results rather than absolutely accurate results. Approximate design exploits a tradeoff of accuracy in computation versus performance and power. However, required accuracy varies according to applications, and 100% accurate results are still required in some situations. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-configurable approximate (ACA) adder for which the accuracy of results is configurable during runtime. Because of its configurability, the ACA adder can adaptively operate in both approximate (inaccurate) mode and accurate mode. The proposed adder can achieve significant throughput improvement and total power reduction over conventional adder designs. It can be used in accuracy-configurable applications, and improves the achievable tradeoff between performance/power and quality. The ACA adder achieves approximately 30% power reduction versus the conventional pipelined adder at the relaxed accuracy requirement.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241600","Accuracy-Configurable Adder;Approximate Arithmetic;Error-Tolerance;Power Minimization","Accuracy;Adders;Approximation methods;Clocks;Delay;Power demand","adders;logic design","accuracy-configurable approximate adder;approximate arithmetic designs;pipelined adder;power reduction","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to fulfill the requirements of the specific scenario, a WSN must provide the right tradeoff between performance and lifetime, which is heavily determined by the network design. However, although the complexity of WSNs is increasing, the design space exploration is often carried out manually without the support of a general analytical methodology. In this paper, we advocate a model-based approach as an efficient and scalable way to explore the energy-performance tradeoffs during the design. In particular, we show that it is possible to define systemlevel models to describe wide classes of WSNs, providing a quick and accurate network evaluation. As a proof of concept, we propose a general model that describes the main characteristics of a class of WSNs for human health monitoring, and we apply it to a real case study. The results show that the energy-performance estimation error of the model never exceeds 1.74% compared to real data, while the evaluation time is reduced by up to 6 orders of magnitude with respect to an accurate network simulation.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241633","Cross-layer design;Model-based design;System-level modeling;Wireless body sensor networks;Wireless sensor networks","Delay;Discrete wavelet transforms;Energy consumption;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical communication;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks","WSN;design exploration;design space exploration;energy-performance estimation error;energy-performance trade-offs;energy-performance tradeoffs;general analytical methodology;human health monitoring;model-based approach;network design;network evaluation;wireless sensor networks","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We take a modeling and language approach that provides an appropriate set of abstractions for the resiliency logic. This cleanly separates the main design behavior from the resiliency behavior, leading to ease of design. Further, as the language abstractions can be automatically synthesized into resiliency logic, our methodology can merge with existing design flows. The concerns of verifying this additional resiliency logic can be addressed by synthesizing behavioral assertions capturing correct behavior.

Due to increasing performance penalties associated with worst-case design, recovery based design has emerged as a promising approach for dealing with the impact of variations. Previous work has applied recovery based design at the circuit and micro-architecture levels of abstraction. In this work, we address the problem of designing variation-tolerant SoCs using the recovery based design paradigm. We demonstrate that a monolithic implementation of recovery based design fails to scale for large SoCs. We propose the concept of recovery islands, wherein each island consists of one or more SoC components that can recover independent of the rest of the SoC, and demonstrate how our proposal can be easily realized via minor changes to a traditional SoC design flow. We study the tradeoffs involved in applying recovery based design at the system level. We demonstrate that it is critical to account for (i) the inherent diversity of the error-voltage profiles among various components in an SoC, and (ii) the impact of error recovery in a component on overall system performance. We then propose a systematic recovery-based SoC design methodology that partitions a given SoC into recovery islands and also computes the optimal operating points for each island, taking into account the various system level trade-offs involved. We evaluate our framework on three different SoC designs, an 802.11b MAC processor, an MPEG encoder and a Wireless Video Capture system and demonstrate an average of 32% energy savings over conventional designs.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241601","Low Power Design;System-on-chip;Variation Aware Design;Variation Tolerance","Clocks;Delay;Error analysis;System performance;System-on-a-chip;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;recovery;system-on-chip","802.11b MAC processor;CMOS scaling;MPEG encoder;SoC components;error recovery impact;error-voltage profiles;parameter variations;recovery islands;systematic recovery-based SoC design methodology;variation-tolerant SoC design;wireless video capture system;worst-case design","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, state-of-the-art multicore simulators either lack good extensibility due to their tightly-coupled design between functional model (FM) and timing model (TM), or cannot guarantee cycle-accuracy. This paper conducts a comprehensive study on factors affecting cycle-accuracy and uncovers several contributing factors ignored before. Based on the study, we propose a loosely-coupled functional-driven full-system simulator for multicore, namely Transformer. To ensure extensibility and cycle-accuracy, Transformer leverages an architecture-independent interface between FM and TM and uses a lightweight scheme to detect and recover from execution divergence between FM and TM. Based on Transformer, a graduate student only needs to write about 180 lines of code and takes about two months to extend an X86 functional model (QEMU) in Transformer. Moreover, the loosely-coupled design also removes the complex interaction between FM and TM and opens the opportunity to parallelize FM and TM to improve performance. Experimental results show that Transformer achieves an average of 8.4% speedup over GEMS while guaranteeing the cycle-accuracy. A further parallelization between FM and TM leads to 35.3% speedup.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241497","Extension;Full-system;Functional-driven;Multicore simulation","Analytical models;Frequency modulation;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Pipelines;Registers;Timing","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;performance evaluation","FM;GEMS;QEMU;TM;Transformer;X86 functional model;architecture-independent interface;execution divergence;functional driven cycle accurate multicore simulator;lightweight scheme;loosely coupled functional driven full system simulator;parallelization;timing model","","2","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GPMOOG uses MOEA/D-DE as the multi-objective optimizer, and a Gaussian Process surrogate model is constructed ON-LINE to predict the results of expensive EM simulations. To avoid false optima for the on-line surrogate model assisted evolutionary computation, a generation control method is used. GPMOOG is demonstrated by a 60GHz integrated transformer, a 1.6GHz antenna and mathematical benchmark problems. Experiments show that compared to directly using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in combination with an EM simulator, which is the best known method in terms of solution quality, comparable results can be obtained by GPMOOG, but at about 1/3-1/4 of the computational effort.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241559","Antenna synthesis;Differential evolution;Efficient global optimization;Gaussian Process;MOEA/D;Multi-objective microwave components synthesis;Transformer synthesis","Computational modeling;Microwave antennas;Microwave filters;Optimization;Predictive models;Vectors","Gaussian processes;evolutionary computation;microwave devices;optimisation","GPMOOG;Gaussian process surrogate model;antenna;computational intelligence technique;embedded electromagnetic simulation;generation control;integrated transformer;microwave component;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;multiobjective optimizer;multiobjective synthesis;online surrogate model assisted evolutionary computation","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve computation efficiency and reduce resources requirement, we propose a hardware realization by utilizing memristor crossbar arrays. In this work, we explore the potential of a memristor crossbar array as an auto-associative memory. More specificly, the recall function of a multi-answer character recognition based on BSB model was realized. The robustness of the proposed BSB circuit was analyzed and evaluated based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The physical constrains when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise. Comparably, the correlations between memristor arrays introduces directional noise and hence dominates the quality of circuits.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241552","BSB model;crossbar array;memristor;neural network;process variation","Biological neural networks;Brain modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Memristors;Neurons;Noise;Robustness","Monte Carlo methods;content-addressable storage;memristors;neural chips;random noise","BSB circuit;BSB model;BSB recall function;Monte-Carlo simulation;auto-associative memory;auto-associative neural network;brain-state-in-a-box;circuit quality;computation efficiency;directional noise;electrical fluctuation;hardware realization;high-performance computing cluster;image processing;memristor array;memristor crossbar array;multianswer character recognition;optical character recognition;process variation;random noise;resources requirement;software level","","2","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although decoupling capacitance is a traditional solution, the reduction of gate capacitance at subthreshold voltage can cause area overhead. In this paper, we propose a decoupling capacitor design strategy to reduce area overhead. The strategy consists of two parts: 1) enhancing gate capacitance through circuit optimizations and 2) using remote decoupling capacitors. Remote decoupling capacitors, which can be placed far from the block to compensate, can minimize the area overhead of the capacitance-enhancing optimizations. They also exploit less utilizable silicon area. The proposed strategy improves the capacitance density by 6.1× without extra process steps, compared to the conventional approach. The gained robustness may be traded off for higher energy efficiency.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241621","decoupling capacitor;subthreshold operation;supply noise;ultra low voltage operation;ultra-low power","Capacitance;Capacitors;Delay;Layout;Logic gates;Noise;Resistance","capacitance;capacitors;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics","capacitance-enhancing optimizations;circuit optimizations;decoupling capacitance;decoupling capacitor design;gate capacitance reduction;remote decoupling capacitors;subthreshold voltage;supply noise minimization;ultra low voltage circuits","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since this leads to time-abstract system models the main challenge is to deal with the concurrency between the individual RTL components. We propose a compositional scheme describing the communication between SoC modules independently of their individual processing speed.

SDF/CSDF explicitly specifies how much data is produced and consumed per firing during computation. This results in strong compile-time analyzability of many useful execution properties such as deadlock absence, channel boundedness, and throughput. However, SDF/CSDF is limited in its ability to capture how data is accessed in time. Hence, using these models often leads to implementations that are suboptimal (i.e., use more resources than necessary) or even incorrect (i.e., use insufficient resources). In this work, we advance a new model called Static Dataflow with Access Patterns (SDF-AP) that captures the timing of data accesses (for both production and consumption). This paper formalizes the semantics of SDF-AP, defines key properties governing model execution, and discusses algorithms to check these properties under correctness and resource constraints. Results are presented to evaluate these analysis algorithms on practical applications modeled by SDF-AP.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241576","Dataflow;access patterns;semantics","Analytical models;Clocks;Computational modeling;Semantics;System recovery;Throughput;Timing","data flow graphs;signal processing","SDF-AP;access patterns;channel boundedness;compile-time analyzability;correctness constraint;data access;deadlock absence;execution properties;multimedia application;resource constraint;signal processing;static/cyclo-static dataflow models;throughput","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present EigenMaps: a new set of algorithms to recover precisely the overall thermal map from a minimal number of sensors and a near-optimal sensor allocation algorithm. The proposed methods are stable with respect to possible temperature sensor calibration inaccuracies, and achieve significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art.

This utilization wall forces designers to ensure that, at any point in time, large fractions of their chips are effectively dark or dim silicon, i.e., either idle or significantly underclocked. As exponentially larger fractions of a chip's transistors become dark, silicon area becomes an exponentially cheaper resource relative to power and energy consumption. This shift is driving a new class of architectural techniques that “spend” area to “buy” energy efficiency. All of these techniques seek to introduce new forms of heterogeneity into the computational stack. We envision that ultimately we will see widespread use of specialized architectures that leverage these techniques in order to attain orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency. However, many of these approaches also suffer from massive increases in complexity. As a result, we will need to look towards developing pervasively specialized architectures that insulate the hardware designer and the programmer from the underlying complexity of such systems. In this paper, I discuss four key approaches - the four horsemen - that have emerged as top contenders for thriving in the dark silicon age.

It is becoming more acceptable to view these diseases as an engineering problem, and systems engineering approaches are becoming more accepted as a means to tackle genetic diseases. In this light, we believe that logic synthesis techniques can play a very important role. Several techniques from the field of logic synthesis can be adapted to assist in the arguably huge effort of modeling and controlling such diseases. The set of genes that control a particular genetic disease can be modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM) called the Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). Important problems include (i) inferring the GRN from observed gene expression data from patients and (ii) assuming that such a GRN exists, determining the ”best” set of drugs so that the disease is ”maximally” cured. In this paper, we report initial results on the application of logic synthesis techniques that we have developed to address both these problems. In the first technique, we present Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) based approaches to infer the logical support of each gene that regulates melanoma, using gene expression data from patients of the disease. From the output of such a tool, biologists can construct targeted experiments to understand the logic functions that regulate a particular gene. The second technique assumes that the GRN is known, and uses a weighted partial Max-SAT formulation to find the set of drugs with the least side-effects, that steer the GRN state towards one that is closest to that of a healthy individual, in the context of colon cancer. Our group is currently exploring the application of several other logic techniques to a variety of related problems in this domain.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241587","Gene Regulation;Genomics;Logic","Bioinformatics;Cancer;Circuit faults;Diseases;Drugs;Genomics","Boolean functions;cancer;computability;finite state machines;genetics;logic design;medical computing","Boolean SAT based approach;Boolean satisfiability;FSM;GRN;colon cancer;disease control;disease modeling;engineering problem;finite state machine;gene expression data;gene regulatory network;genetic disease cure;genetic disease understanding;logic functions;logic synthesis application;melanoma regulation;systems engineering;weighted partial Max-SAT formulation","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous evaluations of the energy efficiency benefits of timing speculation have either been based on code compiled for a traditional target [2] - a processor that produces no errors, or code that relies on additional hardware support [6]. In this paper, we advocate that binaries for timing speculative processors should be optimized differently than those for conventional processors to maximize the energy benefits of timing speculation. Since the program binary determines the utilization pattern of the processor, which in turn influences the error rate of the processor and the energy efficiency of timing speculation, binary optimizations for timing speculative processors should attempt to manipulate the utilization of different microarchitectural units based on their likelihood of causing errors. An exploration of targeted and standard compiler optimizations demonstrates that significant energy benefits are possible from TS-aware binary optimization.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241676","binary optimization;computer architecture;energy efficiency;error resilience;timing speculation","Delay;Error analysis;Hardware;Optimization;Parallel processing;Program processors","computer architecture;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;program compilers","TS-aware binary optimisation;binary optimizations;compiler optimization;field reliability;microarchitectural units;processor error rate;processor pattern utilization;timing speculation energy efficiency compilation;timing speculative processors","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is reported that one third of this overhead is due to the resource-intensive task of manual debugging. To relieve this burden, this work introduces the novel concept of path directed debugging within a window-based abstraction/refinement framework. The algorithm divides the error trace into non-overlapping time-windows where each window is analyzed separately. Subsequent windows are replaced with abstracted over-approximations derived from failing paths in the time domain. Using this abstracted model, each solution found is processed through an additional verification step that removes spurious solutions and simultaneously refines the problem. This paper also develops the theory that shows that the proposed approach is complete, a fact that mitigates the incompleteness inherent in past time-window based debugging methods. Experimental results on industrial designs with long error traces show a 55% decrease in peak memory usage resulting in 78% more instances being solved when compared to previous work.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241618","debug;diagnosis","Abstracts;Algorithm design and analysis;Concrete;Debugging;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model","computability;electronic design automation;formal verification;program debugging","SAT-based design debugging;abstracted over-approximations;industrial designs;manual debugging;nonoverlapping time-windows;path directed abstraction;path directed debugging;path directed refinement;peak memory usage;resource-intensive task;time-window based debugging methods;window-based abstraction framework;window-based refinement framework","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is necessary to consider routing obstacles for modern flip-chip designs, where the obstacles could be regions blocked for signal integrity protection (especially for analog/mixed-signal modules), pre-routed or power/ground nets, and even for through-silicon vias for 3D IC designs. However, no existing published works consider obstacles. To remedy this insufficiency, this paper presents the first work to solve the free-assignment flip-chip routing problem considering obstacles. For the free-assignment routing problem, most existing works apply the network-flow formulation. Nevertheless, we observe that no existing network-flow model can exactly capture the routability of a local routing region (tile) in presence of obstacles. This paper presents the first work that can precisely model the routability of a tile, even with obstacles. Based on this new model, a two-stage approach of global routing followed by detailed routing is proposed.

If employed speculatively with real-time memory controllers, power-down mechanisms could impact both the guaranteed bandwidth and the memory latency bounds. This calls for power-down strategies that can hide or bound the performance loss, making run-time memory power-down feasible for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose two such strategies that reduce memory energy consumption and yet guarantee realtime memory performance. One provides significant energy savings without impacting the guaranteed bandwidth and latency bounds. The other provides higher energy savings with marginally increased latency bounds, while still preserving the guaranteed bandwidth provided by real-time memory controllers. We also present an algorithm to select the most energy-efficient power-down mode at run-time. We experimentally evaluate the two strategies at run-time by executing four media applications concurrently on a real-time MPSoC platform and show memory energy savings of 42.1% and 51.3% for the two strategies, respectively.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241624","Memory Controller;Power-Down;Real-Time;SDRAM","Bandwidth;Equations;Memory management;Real time systems;SDRAM;Switches;Timing","DRAM chips;energy consumption;real-time systems;system-on-chip","energy-efficient power-down mode;guaranteed bandwidth;higher energy savings;marginally increased latency bounds;memory energy consumption;memory energy savings;memory latency bounds;performance loss;power-down mechanisms;powering down SDRAM;real-time MPSoC platform;real-time SDRAM memory controllers;real-time memory controllers;realtime memory performance;run-time memory power-down;run-time power-down strategy","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current practice involves analyzing the architecture to estimate worst-case end-to-end message delays and using these delays to design the control applications. This involves a significant amount of pessimism since the worst-case delays often occur very rarely. We show how to combine functional analysis techniques with model checking in order to derive a delay-frequency interface that quantifies the interleavings between messages with worst-case delays and those with smaller delays. In other words, we bound the frequency with which control messages might suffer the worst-case delay.

However, much smaller distances between the CMPcores enhance the reachability of buses, revitalizing the applicability of snooping protocols for cache-to-cache transfers. In this work, we propose a hybrid NoC design to provide optimized support for cache coherency.

The paper starts by presenting a router architecture for the networked CTI and an effective on-line routing algorithm for multiple charge transfers. In the proposed algorithm, negotiated congestion (NC) routing for multiple charge transfers is performed and any lack of routing resources is addressed by merging two or more charge transfers while maximizing the overall energy efficiency by setting the optimal voltage level for the shared CTI.

Through this fabrication, we derive insights that help guide our research, and we believe, will also be useful to the NoC and multicore research community.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241538","Chip Prototype;Low-Swing Signaling;Multicast Optimization;Network-on-Chip;Theoretical Mesh Limits;Virtual Bypassing","Clocks;Multicore processing;Pipelines;Prototypes;Throughput;Unicast;Wires","CMOS integrated circuits;network-on-chip;power aware computing","16-node chip prototype;45nm SOI;NoC fabrication;SOI CMOS;circuit techniques;energy latency;mesh NoC;microarchitecture techniques;multicore research community;theoretical limits","","1","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For OS designers, this new trend in architectures provides a new opportunity to explore different research directions in scaling operating systems. The primary question facing OS designers over the next ten years will be: What is the correct design of OS services that will scale up to hundreds or thousands of cores, and adapt to the unprecedented variability in demand of the system resources? A fundamental research challenge addressed in this paper is to identify some characteristics of such a scalable OS service for next multicore and cloud computing chips. We argue that the OS services have to deploy elastic techniques to adapt to this variability at runtime. In this paper, we advocate for elastic OS service, illustrate their feasibility and effectiveness in meeting the variable demands through providing elastic technologies for OS services in the fos operating system.

A slew of manual design techniques for approximate computing have been proposed in recent years, but very little effort has been devoted to design automation. We propose SALSA, a Systematic methodology for Automatic Logic Synthesis of Approximate circuits. Given a golden RTL specification of a circuit and a quality constraint that defines the amount of error that may be introduced in the implementation, SALSA synthesizes an approximate version of the circuit that adheres to the pre-specified quality bounds. We make two key contributions: (i) the rigorous formulation of the problem of approximate logic synthesis, enabling the generation of circuits that are correct by construction, and (ii) mapping the problem of approximate synthesis into an equivalent traditional logic synthesis problem, thereby allowing the capabilities of existing synthesis tools to be fully utilized for approximate logic synthesis. In order to achieve these benefits, SALSA encodes the quality constraints using logic functions called Q-functions, and captures the flexibility that they engender as Approximation Don't Cares (ADCs), which are used for circuit simplification using traditional don't care based optimization techniques. We have implemented SALSA using two off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools - SIS and Synopsys Design Compiler. We automatically synthesize approximate circuits ranging from arithmetic building blocks (adders, multipliers, MAC) to entire datapaths (DCT, FIR, IIR, SAD, FFT Butterfly, Euclidean distance), demonstrating scalability and significant improvements in area (1.1X to 1.85X for tight error constraints, and 1.2X to 4.75X for relaxed error constraints) and power (1.15X to 1.75X for tight error constraints, and 1.3X to 5.25X- for relaxed error constraints).","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241596","Approximate Computing;Error Resilience;Logic Synthesis;Low Power Design","Adders;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Optimization;Resilience","logic CAD;logic circuits","Boolean equivalence;DCT;Euclidean distance;FFT butterfly;FIR;IIR;MAC;Q-functions;RTL specification;SAD;SALSA;SIS;adders;algorithmic specifications;approximate circuits;approximate computing;approximate logic synthesis;approximate synthesis;approximation don't cares;arithmetic building blocks;automatic logic synthesis;circuit simplification;datapaths;design automation;design paradigm;error resilience;logic functions;logic synthesis problem;multipliers;off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools;quality bounds;quality constraint;synopsys design compiler;systematic logic synthesis;systematic methodology;tight error constraints","","9","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome the inflexibility and power overhead, a new type of spare cells, metal-configurable gate-array spare cells, are considered.

In two case studies the technique is shown to be at least as exact as reading the documentation with two important advantages: the automated approach is fast and more precise than the existing documentation for the inspected designs.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241617","Design Understanding;Feature Localization;Simulation","Color;Documentation;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Measurement;Prototypes;Software","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","automated feature localization;coverage metrics;documentation quality;functional feature;hardware designs;inspected designs;simulation-based automation technique;source code identification;system-on-chip designs","","1","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Main memory subsystem is expected to consist of hybrid DRAM and phase-change RAM (PRAM) due to the difficulties in DRAM scaling. In this work, we address the performance optimization of the hybrid DRAM/PRAM main memory for single chip CPU/GPU. Based on the tight requirements of low latency from CPU and the relative tolerance to long latency from GPU, DRAM is first allocated to CPU while PRAM with longer write latency is allocated to GPU. Then, in order to improve the write performance of GPU traffic, we propose (1) an in-DRAM write buffer to accommodate GPU write traffics, (2) dynamic hot data management to improve the efficiency of write buffer, (3) runtime-adaptive adjustment of write buffer size to meet the given CPU performance bound, and (4) CPU-aware DRAM access scheduling to give low latency to CPU traffics.

One of the primary challenges in using CGRAs is to develop efficient compilers that can automatically and efficiently map applications to the CGRA. To this end, this paper makes several contributions: i) Using Re-computation for Resource Limitations: For the first time in CGRA compilers, we propose the use of re-computation as a solution for resource limitation problem. This extends the solutions space, and enables better mappings, ii) General Problem Formulation: A precise and general formulation of the application mapping problem on a CGRA is presented, and its computational complexity is established. iii) Extracting an Efficient Heuristic: Using the insights from the problem formulation, we design an effective global heuristic called EPIMap. EPIMap transforms the input specification (a directed graph) to an Epimorphic equivalent graph that satisfies the necessary conditions for mapping on to a CGRA, reducing the search space. Experimental results on 14 important kernels extracted from well known benchmark programs show that using EPIMap can improve the performance of the kernels on CGRA by more than 2.8X on average, as compared to one of the best existing mapping algorithm, EMS. EPIMap was able to achieve the theoretical best performance for 9 out of 14 benchmarks, while EMS could not achieve the theoretical best performance for any of the benchmarks. EPIMap achieves better mappings at acceptable increase in the compilation time.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241674","Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures;Compilation;Modulo Scheduling","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Kernel;Pipeline processing;Registers;Routing;Schedules","benchmark testing;computational complexity;performance evaluation;reconfigurable architectures;resource allocation;search problems","CGRA compilers;EPIMap;Epimorphic equivalent graph;application mapping problem;benchmark programs;coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture;compilation time;computational complexity;efficient heuristic extraction;general problem formulation;global heuristic;kernel extraction;kernel performance improvement;map applications;necessary conditions;power efficiency;resource limitation problem;search space reduction","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A novel layout decomposition algorithm for triple patterning lithography","Shao-Yun Fang; Yao-Wen Chang; Wei-Yu Chen","Grad. Inst. of Electron. Eng., Nat.

Nevertheless, there is very little research focusing on the layout decomposition for TPL. The recent work [16] proposed the first systematic study on the layout decomposition for TPL. However, the proposed algorithm extending a stitch-finding method used in DPL may miss legal stitch locations and generate conflicts that can be resolved by inserting stitches for TPL. In this paper, we point out two main differences between DPL and TPL layout decompositions. Based on the two differences, we propose a novel TPL layout decomposition algorithm. We first present two new graph reduction techniques to reduce the problem size without degrading overall solution quality. We then propose a stitch-aware mask assignment algorithm, based on a heuristic that finds a mask assignment such that the conflicts among the features in the same mask are more likely to be resolved by inserting stitches. Finally, stitches are inserted to resolve as many conflicts as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed layout decomposition algorithm can achieve around 56% reduction of conflicts and more than 40X speed-up compared to the previous work.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241656","Layout Decomposition;Manufacturability;Triple Patterning Lithography","Bridges;Color;Heuristic algorithms;Law;Layout;Lithography","integrated circuit layout;lithography;masks","layout decomposition algorithm;pattern printability;stitch aware mask assignment algorithm;stitch finding method;triple patterning lithography","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed AMOR method is based on the observation that those adjacent nodes of interconnect circuits with almost the same voltage can be aggregated together as a “super node”. Motivated by such an idea, we propose an efficient spectral partition algorithm in AMOR method to partition the nodes into groups with almost the same voltages. The reduced-order models are then obtained by aggregating the adjacent nodes within the same groups together as “super nodes” in AMOR method. The efficiency of AMOR method is not limited by the numbers of the terminals of the networks. Moreover, noticing that the aggregating procedure can be regarded as mapping the original problem into a coarse-grid problem in multigrid method, we propose a computation-efficient smoothing procedure to further improve the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models. With such a strategy, the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models can always be guaranteed. Numerical results have demonstrated that, without the smoothing procedure, the reduced-order models obtained by AMOR can still achieve higher simulation efficiency in terms of accuracy and CPU time than the reduced-order models obtained by the existing elimination based methods. With the smoothing procedure, the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models can further be improved with several iterations.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241525","Interconnect;Many-Terminal;Model Order Reduction","Accuracy;Capacitors;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Partitioning algorithms;Reduced order systems;Resistors","integrated circuit interconnections;reduced order systems","AMOR method;CPU time;aggregating based model order reduction method;coarse-grid problem;computation-efficient smoothing procedure;elimination based method;many-terminal interconnect circuit;multigrid method;network terminal;reduced-order model;spectral partition algorithm;super node","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Simultaneous flare level and flare variation minimization with dummification in EUVL","Shao-Yun Fang; Yao-Wen Chang","Grad. Inst. of Electron. Eng., Nat.

Due to the surface roughness of the optical system used in EUVL, the rather high level of flare (i.e., scattered light) becomes one of the most critical issues in EUVL. In addition, the layout density non-uniformity and the flare periphery effect (the flare distribution at the periphery is much different from that in the center of a chip) also induce a large flare variation within a layout. Both of the high flare level and the large flare variation could worsen the control of critical dimension (CD) uniformity. Dummification (i.e., tiling or dummy fill) is one of the flare compensation strategies to reduce the flare level and the flare variation for the process with a clear-field mask in EUVL. However, existing dummy fill algorithms for Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) are not adequate for the flare mitigation problem in EUVL due to the flare periphery effect. This paper presents the first work that solves the flare mitigation problem in EUVL with a specific dummification algorithm flow considering global flare distribution. The dummification process is guided by dummy demand maps, which are generated by using a quasi-inverse lithography technique. In addition, an error-controlled fast flare map computation technique is proposed and integrated into our algorithm to further improve the efficiency without loss of computation accuracy. Experimental results show that our flow can effectively and efficiently reduce the flare level and the flare variation, which may contribute to the better control of CD uniformity.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241655","Dummification;Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography;Flare;Manufacturability","Accuracy;Layout;Lithography;Merging;Minimization;Rough surfaces;Ultraviolet sources","chemical mechanical polishing;masks;minimisation;surface roughness;ultraviolet lithography","chemical-mechanical polishing;clear-field mask;critical dimension uniformity;dummification;dummy demand maps;extreme ultraviolet lithography;flare compensation;flare level;flare periphery effect;flare variation minimization;global flare distribution;layout density nonuniformity;next generation lithography;quasiinverse lithography;surface roughness","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, caches introduce imprecision in Worst-case Execution Time (WCET) estimation due to unpredictable access latencies. Modern embedded processors often include cache locking mechanism for better timing predictability. As the cache contents are statically known, memory access latencies are predictable, leading to precise WCET estimate. Moreover, by carefully selecting the memory blocks to be locked, WCET estimate can be reduced compared to cache modeling without locking. Existing static instruction cache locking techniques strive to lock the entire cache to minimize the WCET. We observe that such aggressive locking mechanisms may have negative impact on the overall WCET as some memory blocks with predictable access behavior get excluded from the cache. We introduce a partial cache locking mechanism that has the flexibility to lock only a fraction of the cache. We judiciously select the memory blocks for locking through accurate cache modeling that determines the impact of the decision on the program WCET. Our synergistic cache modeling and locking mechanism achieves substantial reduction in WCET for a large number of embedded benchmark applications.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241540","Partial Cache Locking;WCET","Abstracts;Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Concrete;Estimation;Program processors;Timing","benchmark testing;cache storage;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;timing circuits","WCET estimation;WCET minimization;WCET-centric partial instruction cache locking;cache contents;embedded benchmark applications;embedded processor;embedded systems;high speed processors;memory access latency;memory block selection;timing predictability;unpredictable access latency;worst-case execution time","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are considered as the potential SRAM/eDRAM alternatives for last-level caches in terms of energy and area savings. Unfortunately, these non-volatile memory technologies usually have limited write endurance. Even worse, process variation causes some cells to wear out much earlier than others. While state-of-the-art error-tolerant techniques such as ECC can handle transient soft errors, we need a new architecture for non-volatile last-level caches whose reliability is mainly challenged by hard errors. This paper presents Point-and-Discard (PAD), a hard-failure-tolerant architecture for non-volatile caches. PAD has no initial performance penalty and ensures gradual performance overhead with small storage overhead. By adopting PAD, the lifetime of non-volatile caches can be improved by 4.6X over the conventional architecture under a typical process variation condition.<sup>1</sup>","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241518","Cache;error tolerance;non-volatile memories","Arrays;Error correction codes;Multiplexing;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change random access memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;fault tolerant computing;integrated circuit reliability","ECC;PAD;SRAM;area savings;eDRAM;embedded DRAM;energy savings;hard-error-tolerant architecture;leakage power;nonvolatile last level caches;nonvolatile memory technologies;point-and-discard;process variation condition;storage overhead;technology scaling;transient soft errors;write endurance","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose GDRouter, an interleaved global routing and detailed routing algorithm for the ultimate routability i.e., detailed routing routability. The newly proposed router makes the global routing aware of detailed routing routability by correctly setting global capacity to reduce the inconsistency between the two stages. The final result contains both the detailed routing guided global routing and deailed routing solutions. Fast and efficient academic global routing and detailed routing tools FastRoute [1] and RegularRoute [2] are interleaved in GDRouter. In the Initial Capacity and Routing Weight Esitmation (ICRWE) phase, the weight for each global and detailed routing grid is calculated to make GDRouter aware of pin distribution based on a Gridded Voronoi Diagram method. Then the algorithm generates initial global capacity based on both local usage and global segment usage. In particular, Spine routing is utilized to estimate local usage. And a virtual routing i.e. fast implementations of FastRoute and RegularRoute, is performed to estimate global segment usage. The initial global capacity is applied in Full Routing phase to obtain detailed routing routability i.e., number of unassigned global segment. To further improve routability, in the following Iterative Test Routing (ITR) phase, GDRouter incrementally applies the interleaved global routing and detailed routing to adjust the global capcity based on detailed routing solution. To save runtime, GDRouter quits the loop if detailed routing routability stops improving or it reaches maximum iteration. Experimental results reveal that the newly proposed algorithm is capable of enhancing detailed routing routability. In particular, GDRouter reduces number of unassigned global segments by 90% for ISPD98 [3] derived testcases and around 60% for ISPD05/06 [4, 5] derived testcases with 2.9× runtime overhead.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241568","Physical Design;Routing;VLSI CAD","Benchmark testing;Estimation;History;Metals;Pins;Routing;Runtime","computational geometry;network routing","FastRoute;GDRouter;RegularRoute;detailed routing routability;global router;gridded Voronoi diagram;initial capacity;interleaved global routing;iterative test routing;pin distribution;routing grid;routing weight esitmation;ultimate routability;virtual routing","","0","3","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a pre-specified yield requirement, the proposed method conducts uncertainty budgeting by associating performance yield with the size of uncertainty set for process variations. Hence the uncertainty budgeting problem can be further translated into a tractable robust optimization problem. Compared with the existing robust design flow based on ellipsoid model, this method is able to produce more reliable design solutions by allowing varying size of conic uncertainty set at different design points. In addition, the proposed method addresses the limitation that the size of ellipsoid model is calculated solely relying on the distribution of process parameters, while neglecting the dependence of circuit performance upon these design parameters. The proposed robust design framework has been verified on various analog/mixed-signal circuits to demonstrate its efficiency against ellipsoid model. An up to 24% reduction of design cost has been achieved by using the uncertainty budgeting based method.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241557","Budget of Uncertainty;Performance Yield;Process Variations;Robust Design;Uncertainty Set","Circuit optimization;Ellipsoids;Integrated circuit modeling;Robustness;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","conic uncertainty model;conic uncertainty set;design cost reduction;design solution reliability;ellipsoid model;performance yield;process parameter distribution;process variability;robust analog-mixed-signal IC design;robust design framework;set-based robust optimization problem;uncertainty budgeting;variability-affected circuit design","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most commercial processors, however, only have one chip-wide voltage domain because splitting the voltage domain into per-core voltage domains and powering them with multiple off-chip voltage regulators (VRs) incurs a high cost for the platform and package designs. Although using on-chip switching VRs can be an alternative solution, integrating high-quality inductors and cores on the same chip has been a technical challenge. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective power delivery technique to support per-core voltage domains. Our technique is based on the observations that (i) core-to-core voltage variations are relatively small for most execution intervals when the voltages/frequencies are optimized to maximize performance under a power constraint and (ii) per-core power-gating devices augmented with small circuits can serve as low-cost VRs that can provide high efficiency in situations like (i).

This enables efficient simulation of large designs implemented with less-than-perfect devices and components, and also opens the door to formal verification of transistor-level designs against higher-level specifications. In particular, our automatically generated FSMs faithfully capture the behaviour of latches, flip-flops, and circuits constructed from them. Among other technical advances, we generalize an existing (binary-only) FSM-learning approach to arbitrary I/O alphabets, which empowers it to learn high-fidelity abstractions of multi-level-discretized, multi-input/multi-output systems. Our approach, when applied to correctly functioning latches and flip-flops, is able to learn compact, multi-input FSM abstractions whose predictions closely match SPICE simulations. In addition, we have also applied our technique to produce multi-level-discretized FSM representations of digital systems that nevertheless exhibit ""analogish"" traits, such as an over-clocked, error-prone D-flip-flop. For such circuits, the automatically learned FSM abstraction includes additional states that characterise ""failure modes"" of the circuit for specific input sequences (these failure modes are also confirmed by SPICE simulations). Finally, we demonstrate that our technique is also applicable to larger and more complex multi-input, multi-output systems; for example, we are able to automatically derive an accurate FSM abstraction of a 280-transistor (BSIM4), 0-to-5 increment/decrement counter.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241527","Circuit Simulation;Finite State Machine Learning","Clocks;Delay;Integrated circuit modeling;Latches;Machine learning;SPICE;Switches","SPICE;circuit simulation;combinational circuits;finite state machines;flip-flops;formal verification;integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;sequential circuits;transistor circuits","DAE2FSM;I/O alphabets;I/O functionality;SPICE netlist;SPICE simulation;automatic generation;binary-only FSM-learning approach;combinational logic;continuous-time circuit dynamics;continuous-time dynamical system;digital system;discrete-time logical abstraction;failure mode;finite state machine;flip-flop;formal verification;high-fidelity abstraction;latches;multiinput FSM abstraction;multiinput-multioutput system;multilevel-discretized FSM;multilevel-discretized system;sequential logic;transistor-level design","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A silicon PUF is a special circuit embedded in an IC that relies on random fabrication process variations to produce a unique signature for its native IC. While current research directions have focused on improving PUF quality at the architectural level, little work has explicitly targeted their fundamental source of randomness, the fabrication process. During IC fabrication, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is typically used to suppress manufacturing variations. In this paper, we recognize that this is actually counterintuitive for PUFs. We provide a novel framework which enables OPC to increase the effects of manufacturing variations within PUF circuitry and produce more randomness in PUFs for greater uniqueness and reliability. The proposed OPC techniques are validated using a population of 100 ring oscillator PUFs. Results show that our schemes provide over five times larger variation in ring oscillator delay, improve PUF uniqueness by 5%, and improve PUF reliability by as much as 70% when compared to conventional OPC.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241496","Lithography;Optical Proximity Correction;Physically Unclonable Functions;Process Variation","Integrated circuits;Integrated optics;Lithography;Optical device fabrication;Reliability;Resists","cryptography;elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit reliability;proximity effect (lithography);silicon","IC fabrication;OPC;PUF circuitry;PUF reliability improvement;PUF uniqueness improvement;integrated circuits;manufacturing variation suppression;optical proximity correction;physical tampering;random fabrication process variations;ring oscillator PUF;ring oscillator delay variation;security applications;silicon PUF quality improvement;silicon-based physically unclonable function improvement;unique signature generation","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, advanced design rules, more IP and hierarchical design styles for super-large billion-gate designs, serious buffering problems from interconnect scaling and metal layer stacks make routing a much more challenging problem [2]. This paper discusses a series of techniques that may relieve this problem, and guide the physical design closure system to produce not only easier to route designs, but also better timing quality. Open challenges are also overviewed at the end.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241547","Physical Synthesis;Timing Driven Routing","Logic gates;Metals;Optimization;Routing;Timing;Wires","interconnections;logic design;network routing;network synthesis;trees (mathematics)","Steiner wire model;easier-to-route designs;interconnect scaling;logic synthesis;optimal Steiner tree;physical design closure system;synthesis-based optimization","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%.

They are tolerant of manufacturing defects, and learn and adapt for better performance. In many cases they can self-repair damage. These advantages suggest that biological systems might be useful in a wide variety of tasks involving information processing. So far, all attempts to use the nervous system of a living organism for information processing have involved selective breeding of existing organisms. This approach, largely independent of the details of internal operation, is used since we do not yet understand how neural systems work, nor exactly how they are constructed. However, as our knowledge increases, the day will come when we can envision useful nervous systems and design them based upon what we want them to do, as opposed to variations on what has been already built.

Most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration.

This poses a tremendous challenge on how to print and manufacture these ever-shrinking physical components that make up the transistors and the interconnect - generation after process generation. One aspect of this challenge is that the process rules are exploding in complexity - directly translating into physical design EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool complexity. Traditional design rules governed the spacing, overlap or alignment of any two layout objects from this set: diffusion, poly, via cut, wire, etc. In this work we propose a solution that relies on grids (aka. Fabrics), models the design rules on those grids and presents them to the EDA tools in such a way that it minimizes the complexity cost on the tools' side.

Lately, it has become common to use a “light mode” version of the global router, similar to today's academic routers, to quickly evaluate the routability of a given placement. This use model suffers from two primary weaknesses: (i) it does not adequately model the local routing resources, while the model is important to remove opens and shorts and eliminate DRC violations, (ii) the metrics used to represent congestion are non-intuitive and often fail to pinpoint the key issues that need to be addressed.

For the very large grids in modern designs, incremental verification is highly desirable, because it allows one to skip the verification of a certain section of the grid (internal nodes)and instead, verify only the rest of the grid (external nodes). We propose an efficient approach for incremental verification in the context of vectorless constraints-based grid verification, under dynamic conditions. The traditional difficulty is that the dynamic case requires iterative analysis of both the internal and external sections. This has been previously overcome for simulation purposes, but we provide the first solution for verification, through two key contributions: 1)a bound on the internal nodes' voltages is developed that eliminates the need for iterative analysis, and 2)a multi-port Norton approach is used to construct a reduced macromodel for the internal section. As a result, we demonstrate significant reductions in runtime, with speed-ups in the range of 3-8×, with negligible impact on accuracy.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241504","Power Grid;voltage drop","Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Power grids;Symmetric matrices;Upper bound;Vectors","formal verification;integrated circuit design;power grids","complex high-performance integrated circuit design;dynamic conditions;external nodes;incremental on-die power grid verification;internal node voltage bound;iterative analysis;multiport Norton approach;vectorless constraints-based grid verification","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we describe a novel technique of adaptive post-silicon tuning to reliably design MEMS filters that are robust to process variations. Our key idea is to implement a number of redundant MEMS resonators to form an array and then optimally select a subset of these resonators to achieve the desired frequency response. Several new CAD algorithms and methodologies are proposed to optimize and configure the design variables of the proposed MEMS resonator array. A MEMS design example demonstrates that the proposed post-silicon tuning is able to reduce the ripple of the channel filter gain by 7× over other traditional approaches.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241508","MEMS Filter;Process Variation","Arrays;Band pass filters;Frequency modulation;Micromechanical devices;Optimization;Resonant frequency;Resonator filters","elemental semiconductors;micromechanical resonators;optimisation;radiofrequency filters;silicon;statistical analysis","Si","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is in large part due to the non-availability of public designs depicting industrial wiring stacks and other complexities affecting design routability. The aim of the DAC 2012 routability-driven placement contest is to address these issues, by way of the following: (a) release challenging benchmark designs that are derived from modern industrial ASICs, and contain information to perform both placement and routing, (b) present a new congestion metric, as well as an accurate congestion analysis framework to evaluate and compare the routability of various placement algorithms. We hope that a set of challenging benchmarks, along with a standard, publicly available evaluation framework will further advance research in routability-driven placement.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241593","Benchmarks;Congestion Analysis;Physical Design;Placement;Routing","Benchmark testing;Measurement;Nickel;Pins;Routing;Wiring","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;network routing","benchmark design;congestion metrics;crude congestion model;design congestion;design routability;industrial wiring stacks;modern industrial ASIC;routability driven placement","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, we propose a light-weight interrupt system to reduce the OS overhead of handling interrupts which occur frequently in an accelerator-rich platform. Third, we propose architectural support that allows us to compose a larger virtual accelerator out of multiple smaller accelerators.

To minimize the routing demand, POLAR 2.0 attaches very high importance to maintaining a good wirelength-driven placement in the global placement stage. To distribute the routing demand, cells in congested regions are spread out by a novel routability-driven rough legalization in a global manner and by a history based cell inflation technique in a local manner.

By combing topological classification and critical feature extraction, our hotspot detection framework achieves very high accuracy. Furthermore, to speed up the evaluation, we verify only possible layout clips instead of full-layout scanning. After detection, we filter hotspots to reduce the false alarm.
