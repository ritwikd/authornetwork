The new methodology is based on the creation of a silicon virtual prototype early in the back-end design process. The prototype is generated in a fraction of the time required to complete the traditional back-end flow but still maintains very high correlation with the final design. The physical prototype becomes the 'cockpit' where many design implementation decisions can be optimized by leveraging the short iteration times. Hierarchical design methodologies benefit from the prototyping stage by enabling a more optimal partitioning. The silicon virtual prototype also alters the nature of the hand-off model between front-end and back-end designers. The netlist can now be quickly validated using the prototype: the physical reality is being injected early in the design process resulting in fewer iterations between front-end and back-end.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195101","","Chip scale packaging;Design methodology;Logic design;Process design;Prototypes;Routing;Silicon;System-on-a-chip;Timing;Virtual prototyping","circuit optimisation;convergence;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit layout;iterative methods;logic design;system-on-chip","SVP;Si;SoC design methodology;back-end physical design process;convergence methodology;design optimization;front-end logic design;hand-off model;hierarchical design methodologies;iteration times;netlist validation;optimal partitioning;silicon virtual prototyping;system-on-chip;virtual prototype","","1","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the segmentation design, we consider the similarity of input routing instances and formulate a net-matching problem to construct the optimal segmentation architecture. For the router design, we present a matching-based timing-driven routing algorithm which can consider a versatile set of routing segments. Experimental results show that our designed segmentations significantly outperform those used in commercially available FPGAs. For example, our designed segmentations achieve, on average, 14.6% and 19.7% improvements in routability, compared with those used in the Lucent Technologies ORCA 2C-series and the Xilinx XC4000E-series FPGAs, respectively.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195136","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer aided manufacturing;Design automation;Design optimization;Electronics industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic arrays;Manufacturing industries;Routing;Switches","circuit layout CAD;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD;logic partitioning;network routing;reconfigurable architectures;timing","CAD;FPGA architecture design;Lucent ORCA 2C-series FPGA;Xilinx XC40OOE-series FPGA;array-based FPGA routing;array-based FPGA segmentation design;graph matching-based algorithms;input routing instance similarity;matching-based timing-driven routing algorithm;net-matching problem;optimal segmentation architecture;routability;router design;router development;router performance;routing architecture design;routing segments;unified matching-based algorithms","","1","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This way, we are able to reduce the exploration time dramatically.

The scan chain technique proposed is easy to use and has very low overhead. The scan-chain based implementation capitalizes on the capability of newer FPGAs to connect several LUTs serially and configure them as shift registers. The hardware debugging procedure proposed using the shift register LUTs does not require any recompilation of the design to change the watch-point conditions and thus is very fast. In this paper, the area overhead resulting from addition of a scan-chain based watch-point logic is discussed and is compared with other proposed debugging techniques.

For example, an application processor for cellular phone was designed using many low-power technologies. Both device / circuits level and architecture / logic level low power technologies are discussed.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195046","","Application software;Cellular phones;Circuits;Clocks;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Energy consumption;Logic devices;Microprocessors;Power supplies","embedded systems;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","application processor;cellular phone;embedded microprocessor;low-power design","","1","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve a higher performance for the AE64000, we design a branch predictor for the processor, and find the optimum parameters for the design through cycle-accurate simulations on SpecINT benchmarks and embedded applications (Dhrystone and Whetstone). In the AE64000, branch prediction is complicated by the instruction folding unit (IFU) of the processor front-end. By predicting on a pre-PC in the IFU, rather than using a PC in the pipeline core, we can effectively eliminate the branch misprediction penalty on a correct prediction. We have developed the AE64000 simulator to evaluate the performance of the designed branch predictor, and selected the optimum branch predictor configuration by considering cost-effectiveness as well as by analyzing the results generated from the AE64000 simulator.

Most multimedia applications access stream type of data structures with regular access patterns. It is observed that conventional caches behave poorly for stream-type data structure. Therefore, prediction-based prefetching techniques have been extensively researched to exploit the regular access patterns. Prefetching, however, may pollute the cache if the prediction is not accurate and needs extra hardware prediction logic. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel hardware prefetching technique that is assisted by static analysis of data access pattern with stream caches.

Circuits such as ring-oscillators have a TIP, lying between the values for nand pMOSFET. The circuit TIP Is close to the n-MOSFET TIP for long L<sub>g</sub> and gets closer to the p-MOSFET TIP for short L<sub>g</sub>. The reason is the different temperature dependence of electron and hole mobility as a function of L<sub>g</sub>. Due to the high field effect, oscillation periods of ring-oscillators with short L<sub>g</sub> hardly improve, when the supply voltage is raised beyond the TIP. Therefore, an advantageous supply-voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) choice for pocket-implant technologies is near the TIP of circuits, allowing a favorable combination of short switching delay and minimized temperature dependence.

The rapidly increasing design complexity, combined with the demand for the capability of handling nearly flattened designs for physical hierarchy generation, poses significant challenges to existing placement algorithms. There are very few studies on understanding the optimality and scalability of placement algorithms, due to the limited sizes of existing benchmarks and limited knowledge of optimal solutions. The contribution of this paper includes two parts: (1) we implemented an algorithm for generating synthetic benchmarks that have known optimal wirelengths and can match any given net distribution vector; (2) using benchmarks of 10K to 2M placeable modules with known optimal solutions, we studied the optimality and scalability of three state-of-the-art placers, Dragon (M. Wang et al, Proc. Int. Conf. on CAD, pp. 260-264, 2000), Capo (A.E. Caldwell et al, Proc. Design Automation Conf., pp. 477-482, 2000), mPL (K. Sze, 2002) from academia, and one leading edge industrial placer, QPlace from Cadence. For the first time our study reveals the gap between the results produced by these tools versus true optimal solutions. The wirelengths produced by these tools are 1.66 to 2.53 times the optimal in the worst cases, and are 1.46 to 2.38 times the optimal on the average. As for scalability, the average solution quality of each tool deteriorates by an additional 4% to 25% when the problem size increases by a factor of 10. These results indicate significant room for improvement in existing placement algorithms.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195099","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Computer science;Integrated circuit interconnections;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Logic design;Partitioning algorithms;Process design;Scalability","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit metallisation;network routing","Cadence QPlace;Capo;DSM technologies;Dragon;IC design process;circuit performance bottleneck;design complexity;flattened designs;mPL;net distribution vector;on-chip interconnects;optimal wirelengths;optimality;physical hierarchy generation;placeable module benchmarks;placement algorithms;scalability;synthetic benchmarks","","18","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently there has been renewed interest in this problem due to the need for highly scalable algorithms able to handle nets with tens of thousands of terminals. In this paper we give a practical O(n log<sup>2</sup> n) heuristic for computing near-optimal rectilinear Steiner trees based on a hatched version of the greedy triple contraction algorithm of Zelikovsky (Algorithmica vol. 9, pp. 463-470, 1993). Experiments conducted on both random and industry test cases show that our heuristic matches or exceeds the quality of best known RSMT heuristics, e.g. on random instances with more than 100 terminals our heuristic improves over the rectilinear minimum spanning tree by an average of 11%. Moreover, our heuristic has very good runtime scaling, e.g. it can route a 34k-terminals net extracted from a real design in less than 25 seconds compared to over 86 minutes needed by the O(n<sup>2</sup>) edge-based heuristic of Borah, Owens, and Irwin (Discrete Appl. Math. vol. 90, pp. 51-67, 1999). Since our heuristic is graph-based, it can be easily modified to handle practical considerations such as routing obstacles, preferred directions, via costs, and octilinear routing - indeed, experimental results show only a small factor increase in runtime when switching from rectilinear to octilinear routing.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195132","","Computer science;Costs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Research and development;Routing;Runtime;Silicon;Steiner trees;Testing;Tree graphs","VLSI;algorithm theory;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","25 s;86 min;RSMT;RSMT heuristics;edge-based heuristic;electronic design automation;graph-based heuristic;greedy triple contraction algorithm;minimum-length interconnection;net routing time;octilinear Steiner trees;octilinear routing;preferred directions;rectilinear Steiner minimum tree problem;rectilinear Steiner trees;rectilinear minimum spanning tree;rectilinear plane terminals;rectilinear routing;routing obstacles;runtime scaling;scalable algorithms;via costs","","16","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Relaxing the requirement of 100% correctness in operation drastically reduces the costs of design but, at the same time, requires SoCs be designed with some degree of system-level fault-tolerance. In this paper, we introduce a high-level model of DSM failure patterns and propose a new communication paradigm for SoCs, namely stochastic communication. Specifically, for a generic tile-based architecture, we propose a randomized algorithm which not only separates computation from communication, but also provides the required fault-tolerance to on-chip failures. This new technique is easy and cheap to implement in SoCs that integrate a large number of communicating IP cores.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195021","","CMOS technology;Costs;Design automation;Design methodology;Fault tolerance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Network-on-a-chip;Protocols;Tiles;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;failure analysis;fault tolerant computing;integrated circuit reliability;stochastic processes;system-on-chip","CMOS technology;DSM failure patterns;NoC architecture;SoC design;VLSI chips;communicating IP cores;deep submicron domain;failure model;generic tile-based architecture;high-level model;network-on-chip architecture;on-chip failures;on-chip fault-tolerant communication;performance metrics;randomized algorithm;stochastic communication;system-level fault tolerance;system-on-chip design","","35","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By linking the two design domains of DSP and FPGA hardware design, the MATCH compiler provides DSP design teams a significant reduction in design labor and time, elimination of misinterpretations and costly design rework, automatic verification of the hardware implementation, and the ability of systems engineers an algorithm developers to perform architectural exploration in the early phases of their development cycle. The paper describes how powerful directives are used to provide high-level architectural tradeoffs for the DSP designer. The MATCH compiler has been transferred to a startup company called AccelChip which has developed a commercial version of the compiler called AccelFPGA. Experimental results are reported using AccelFPGA on a set of nine MATLAB benchmarks that are mapped onto the recent Xilinx Virtex II and Altera Stratix FPGAs.

Since exhaustive functional simulation is impossible for even a small C program, it is important to quantitatively measure the extent of design verification during simulation by a set of test vectors. Various coverage metrics have been proposed for measuring the degree of design verification. Most of them compute the extent of design excitation (controllability) but are unable to say whether the excitation responses have propagated to observable points in the program (observability). In this paper we propose a metric for code coverage analysis of C programs that addresses not only controllability but tackles observability as well. Thus, this metric is able to tell what percentage of the simulation responses have been propagated to observable points in the program like primary outputs or printed variables. We improve upon a recently proposed observability enhanced software coverage metric by increasing the accuracy of the analysis as well as decreasing the simulation runtime overhead by using an event-driven coverage analysis method.

Under this real-world design scenario, we found, unlike related previous research, that power can hardly be estimated closer than around 15% using an instruction level model. However, we can estimate the energy as close as 5%. Our research has resulted in the SEA framework that estimates energy/power consumed by a software program, taking specific micro-architectural features of the underlying programmable hardware core into consideration. With this high accuracy in energy estimation, we achieve around 5 orders of magnitude faster estimations compared to state-of-the art high-level (RTL) commercial energy/power estimation tool suites.

For this reason the order of analysis can be significantly higher than that for a Volterra series implementation while fully accounting for all nonlinearity effects. The proposed methodology is not restricted to weakly nonlinear circuits, but can also analyze per-nonlinearity distortion for active switching mixers and switch capacitor circuits when they are modeled as periodically time-varying weakly nonlinear systems. While Volterra series have also been attempted for this same class of circuits, the requirement of device models for all of the high order model derivatives makes such analysis somewhat impractical. The proposed methodology provides important design insights regarding the relationships between design parameters and circuit linearity, hence the overall system performance.

Such skew can be remedied by selecting a balancing node (BN) and adjust its edges so that the skew gets smaller. The required edge adjustments are determined using the Elmore delay model. The performance of the algorithm is investigated using different random sets of clock pins. Also, the algorithm is tested by altering some clock pins in a zero skew CDN. For small modifications in a large number of nodes in the CDN, our algorithm can achieve zero skew with less iterations than linear order algorithms.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195023","","Capacitance;Clocks;Delay;Educational institutions;Pins;Process design;System-on-a-chip;Testing;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit CAD;clocks;delays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;iterative methods;system-on-chip","Elmore delay model;SoC;VLSI system design modification;adaptive wire adjustment;balancing node edge adjustment;bounded skew clock distribution network;clock pins;clock skew;iterations;iteratively adjusted CDN wires;linear order algorithms;system on chip complexity;zero skew CDN","","4","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional post-layout based fixing methodologies quickly break down when hundreds of thousands of nets need to be tailored for signal integrity concerns. In order to achieve signal integrity closure, cross talk, electro-migration, IR drop and other effects must be addressed earlier in the design cycle. In this paper, a new placement algorithm considering cross talk minimization is presented. First, a probabilistic technique is presented to estimate the coupling capacitance during coarse placement. Based on this technique, an effective placement flow is introduced to remove the highly coupled spots via placement density control. By addressing cross talk at placement level with this algorithm, the value and count of the highest post route peak noise were successfully reduced in a set of industrial benchmarks. Furthermore, due to reduced coupling capacitance, the design speed is 8% faster on average in comparison with traditional timing-driven, congestion-aware placement flow.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195117","","Capacitance;Coupling circuits;Geometry;Minimization;Routing;Signal design;Signal processing;Topology;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;capacitance;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise;interference (signal);logic design;minimisation","IR drop;VLSI;coarse placement;congestion-aware placement flow;coupling capacitance optimization;cross talk driven placement;cross talk minimization;electro-migration;highly coupled spots;placement density control;post route peak noise reduction;post-layout based fixing;probabilistic technique;reliability;signal integrity;timing-driven placement flow","","3","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Little has been investigated on the interdependencies between code placement techniques and interconnect traffic (e.g. bus traffic) and optimization techniques combining both. In this paper we show as the first approach of its kind that a carefully designed known code placement strategy combined and adapted to a known interconnect encoding scheme does not only lead to a performance increase but it does also lead to a significant reduction of interconnect-related energy consumption. This becomes especially interesting since future SoC bus systems (or more general: ""networks on a chip"") are predicted to be a dominant energy consumer of an SoC. We show that a high-level optimization strategy like code placement and a lower-level optimization strategy like interconnect encoding are NOT orthogonal. Specifically, we report cache miss reduction ratios of 32% in average combined with bus related energy savings of 50.4% in average (with a maximum of up to 95.7%) by means of our combined optimization strategy. The results have been verified by means of diverse real-world SoC applications.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1194987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194987","","Batteries;Design methodology;Embedded system;Encoding;Energy consumption;Energy dissipation;National electric code;Power system interconnection;Silicon;System-on-a-chip","VLSI;cache storage;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;embedded systems;encoding;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics;storage allocation;system buses;system-on-chip","SoC bus systems;address bus coding;cache miss reduction ratios;code placement;combined optimization strategy;deep-submicron designs;embedded systems;high-level optimization strategy;interconnect encoding scheme;interconnect traffic;interconnect-related energy consumption;lower-level optimization strategy;multi-parametric improvements;optimization techniques","","0","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study the problem of power supply noise avoidance as early as in the floorplanning stage. We show that the noise avoidance in the power supply planning problem can be formulated as a constrained maximum flow problem and present an efficient yet effective heuristic to handle the problem. Experimental results are encouraging. With a slight increase of total wirelength, we achieve almost no IR-drop requirement violation and a 46.6% improvement in ΔI noise constraint violation compared with a previous approach.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195053","","Integrated circuit layout;Integrated circuit manufacture;Integrated circuit noise;Integrated circuit reliability;Integrated circuit technology;Power supplies;Power system planning;Power system reliability;Signal design;Working environment noise","heuristic programming;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit reliability","ΔI noise;IC reliability;IR-drop requirement;SoC;constrained maximum flow problem;floorplanning;heuristic;noise constraint violation;post-route methodologies;power supply noise avoidance;power supply planning;signal integrity problems;time-to-market delays;total wirelength","","10","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method can eliminate up to 97% of the transitions on the instruction address bus and 75% of the transitions on the data address bus with a small hardware overhead.

This problem is caused by high current density flowing in the metal interconnect. Therefore, current evaluation is a crucial concern in IC design. SPICE level circuit simulators are excellent for doing current calculation; however, their running times are too expensive to be used repeatedly in design synthesis loops. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the interconnect current calculation. This method is based on moment matching but does not need high order moments. It only needs to traverse the RC tree once to get the mean current value of every segment, while traversing the tree once more is enough for the RMS current calculation, and two more traversals is sufficient for the peak current calculation. We apply our method to a larger number of interconnects getting close-to-SPICE accuracy at significantly faster runtimes. In particular, applying the method to 17,387 wire segments in the clock tree of a commercial IC, we obtained that the average deviation error of mean current is 0.0569%, average RMS current error is 0.703% and average peak current error is 6.552%. It took 28 hours for HSPICE to get the current value of all the wire segments and it only took our method 156 seconds.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1194990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194990","","Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Current density;Electromigration;Integrated circuit interconnections;Reliability;Runtime;SPICE;Very large scale integration;Wire","SPICE;VLSI;circuit CAD;current density;electromigration;error analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation;integrated circuit reliability","156 s;28 hour;HSPICE;IC design;RC tree;RMS current calculation;SPICE level circuit simulators;VLSI technology scaling;average RMS current error;average deviation error;average peak current error;clock tree;current density;design synthesis loops;electromigration;interconnect current calculation;mean current;metal interconnect;moment matching;moment order;peak current;running time;runtimes;segment mean current value;system reliability;wire segments","","1","1","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two algorithms, CET1 and CET2, are presented to perform the task of compacting the error trace. Both algorithms first use an efficient approach to eliminate the redundant states, to generate the unique states of the error trace. Then, CET1 builds the connected graph of these unique states by computing the reachable states by one cycle for each unique state, and then applies Dykstra's shortest path algorithm to find out the shortest error trace in the connected graph. Compared with CET1, CET2 computes the reachable states by one cycle for those unique states, when they are needed in Dykstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest error trace. After finding the shorter trace, the corresponding input/output test vectors are generated. The experimental results show that both algorithms can reduce the length of error traces dramatically for most cases using reasonable memory. For cases requiring longer CPU time to find the shortest trace, CET2 is up to 37 times faster than CET1.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195000","","Circuit simulation;Computer bugs;Contracts;Councils;Debugging;Digital circuits;Power capacitors;Silicon;Testing;Very large scale integration","circuit simulation;error detection;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;logic design;logic simulation;logic testing","Dykstra shortest path algorithm;bug fix verification;debugging process time reduction;error trace compacting algorithms;error trace compaction;error trace length reduction;input/output test vectors;one cycle reachable states;pseudo-random simulation;random simulation;redundant state elimination;shortest error trace computation;unique error trace states;unique state connected graph","","8","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the reported works on PTL synthesis are based on the Reduced Ordered BDDs (ROBDDs). We have developed a novel heuristic-based technique for obtaining Reduced Unordered BDDs (RUBDDs), which leads to circuits of smaller size having lesser delay and smaller power consumption compared to the existing results.

Leakage power dissipation is rapidly becoming a substantial contributor to the total power dissipation as threshold voltage becomes small. Similarly, the hot-carrier effect is one of the most significant failure mechanisms in high-density VLSI circuits. In this paper, a technology mapping technique is presented for use in reducing the leakage power dissipation of the circuit by utilizing a dual-threshold voltage cell library and for minimizing the aged delay of the circuit by considering the effect of hot carriers on the cell speeds as the circuit ages. In addition, this paper presents two methods to reduce delay during technology mapping: primary output ordering and pin permutation. Experimental results show that the total power dissipation and leakage power dissipation can be reduced by up to 27% and 52% as a result of the leakage-aware technology mapping and that the circuit aging phenomenon can be reduced by up to 10.6% as a result of hot-carrier-aware technology mapping.

Expression of the equations in polynomial form provides a balance between accuracy and computational complexity. These equations are mapped according to the geometric structures for which they are most suitable in minimizing runtime in the calculation of inductance while remaining accurate to within 3%. Within the geometrical constraints, the wires are of arbitrary specification. From a comprehensive evaluation on the ITRS-specified global wiring structure for 2003, the values for inductance extracted through the proposed approach are within 3% of the values obtained by commercial three-dimensional (3-D) field solvers. The efficiency of the proposed approach is also demonstrated by extraction from a real layout design that has 300-k interconnecting segments.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195007","","Bars;Computational complexity;Current density;Equations;Inductance;Polynomials;Proximity effect;Skin;Taylor series;Wires","CMOS integrated circuits;VLSI;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;polynomials","TRS-specified global wiring structure;Taylor's expansion;approximate formulae;computational complexity;geometric structures;interconnections;layout design;mutual inductance;on-chip inductance extraction;polynomial form;uniform current density","","0","1","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, until now, no synthesis techniques have been proposed for the design and efficient use of such systems. We have two main objectives: synthesis and conceptual. The synthesis goal is to introduce the first design technique for quality-of-service (QoS) low power synthesis. The conceptual objective is to develop a generic technique for the automatic development of on-line algorithms from efficient off-line algorithms using statistical techniques. We first summarize a system of provably-optimal techniques that minimize energy consumption of stream-oriented applications under two main QoS metrics: latency and synchronization. Specifically, we study how multiple voltages can be used to simultaneously satisfy hardware requirements and minimize power consumption, while preserving the requested level of QoS in terms of latency and synchronization. The off-line algorithm is used as input to statistical software used to identify important relevant parameters of the processes, buffer occupancy rate indicators, and a way how combine them to form a fast and efficient on-line algorithm which decides which task to run at which voltage. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated on a number of standard multimedia benchmarks.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1194994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194994","","Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Delay;Energy consumption;Hardware;Power engineering computing;Quality of service;Software algorithms;Streaming media;Voltage","low-power electronics;minimisation;mobile communication;multimedia communication;processor scheduling;quality of service;statistical analysis;synchronisation","QoS design technique;QoS sensitive systems;buffer occupancy rate indicators;energy constraints;energy consumption minimization;latency;low power synthesis;mobile systems;multimedia;multiple voltage circuits;on-line power minimization;quality-of-service requirements;statistical analysis;stream-oriented applications;synchronization;task voltage scheduling","","2","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Buffer insertion/sizing is one of the most effective and popular techniques to reduce interconnect delay and decouple coupling effects. It is traditionally applied to post-layout optimization. However, it is obviously infeasible to insert/size hundreds of thousands of buffers during the post-layout stage when most routing regions are occupied. Therefore, it is desirable to incorporate buffer planning into floorplanning to ensure timing closure and design convergence. In this paper, we first derive formulae of buffer insertion for timing and noise optimization, and then apply the formulae to compute the feasible regions for inserting buffers to meet both timing and noise constraints. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an average success rate of 80.9% (78.2%) of nets meeting timing constraints alone (both timing and noise constraints) and consumes an average extra area of only 0.49% (0.66%) over the given floorplan, compared with the average success rate of 75.6% of nets meeting timing constraints alone and an extra area of 1.33% by the BBP method (J.

Its features are: (1) The smallest packing based on a given SSP can be obtained in O(n) time, where n is the number of rectangles. (2) An arbitrary packing can be represented by SSP. (3) The total representation number of SSP of size n is not more than that of rectangular dissection of the same size with n-<span style=""font-family:Arial"" class=MsoNormal>└</span>√(4n-1)<span style=""font-family:Arial"" class=MsoNormal>┘</span> empty rooms (the necessary number of empty rooms to represent an arbitrary packing). To realize these features of SSP, we propose an algorithm to enumerate all adjacent crosses on a seq-pair in linear time of n + k (k is the number of adjacent crosses). Also we apply a conventional method to convert a seq-pair without adjacent crosses to an equivalent Q-sequence, representation of rectangular dissection, in O(n + k) time. A move operation to obtain an adjacent solution efficiently is proposed to perturb SSP for Simulated Annealing (SA). From experimental results, we confirmed the proposed method was carried out in linear time and was more efficient than the conventional method when SSP size got bigger.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195037","","Agricultural engineering;Agriculture;Decoding;Simulated annealing;Upper bound;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","VLSI layout design;adjacent crosses;decodable packing representation;linear time;rectangles;rectangular dissection;selected sequence-pair;simulated annealing","","7","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed scheme implicitly partitions a given design into control domain and datapath domain, and symbolic simulation is carried out on both domains. With this scheme, the run-time OBDD sizes during the symbolic simulation for each domain can be limited. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by verifying the memory management unit (MMU) in Motorola high-performance microprocessors.

In this paper, we propose a method to reduce interconnect cost of a floorplan by searching alternative packings. We found that if a floorplan F contains some rectangular supermodules, we can rearrange the blocks in the supermodule to obtain a new floorplan with the same area as F but possibly with a smaller interconnect cost.

Clustered architecture offers a promising alternative to alleviate the problem. In the clustered architecture, the cache, register file and function units are all partitioned into clusters such that short CPU cycle time can be achieved. A key challenge is the arrangement of inter-cluster communication. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for scheduling inter-cluster communication operations. Our algorithm achieves better register resource utilization than the previous methods. By judiciously putting the selected spilled variables into their corresponding consumer's local cache, the costly cross-cache transfer is minimized. Therefore, the distributed caches are used more efficiently and the register constraint can be satisfied without compromising the schedule performance. The experiments shows that our technique outperforms the existing cluster-oriented schedulers.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1194996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194996","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Delay;Digital signal processing;Pipeline processing;Processor scheduling;Registers;Scheduling algorithm;Signal processing algorithms","VLSI;cache storage;logic partitioning;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","CPU cycle time;VLSI;cluster partitioning;clustered VLIW processors;consumer local cache;cross-cache transfer;distributed cache clustered architecture;distributed caches;function units;inter-cluster communication;latency minimization;register aware scheduling;register constraints;register file;register resource utilization;spill codes;spilled variables;wire delays","","1","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By setting the computed seed as an initial value, target fault coverage, for example 100%, can be accomplished with minimum test length. We can also maximize fault coverage for a given test length. Our method can be used for both test-per-dock and test-per-scan BISTs. The procedure is based on vector representations over GF(2<sup>m</sup>), where m is the number of LFSR stages. The results indicate that test lengths derived through selected seeds are about sixty percent shorter than those derived by conventionally selected seeds for a given fault coverage. We also show that seeds obtained through this technique accomplish higher fault coverage than the conventional selection procedure. In terms of the c7552 benchmark, taking a test-per-scan architecture with a 20-bit LFSR as an example, the number of undetected faults can be decreased from 304 to 227 for 10,000 LFSR patterns using our proposed technique.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195139","","Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Programmable logic arrays;Test pattern generators;Very large scale integration","VLSI;automatic test pattern generation;built-in self test;fault location;integrated circuit testing;shift registers","20 bit;LFSR stages;LFSR-based random pattern generators;VLSI BIST;c7552 benchmark;computed seed initial value;fault coverage;minimum test length;seed selection procedure;selection procedure;target fault coverage;test length;test lengths;test-per-dock BIST;test-per-scan BIST;test-per-scan architecture;undetected faults;vector representations","","1","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also propose a simple and effective model of spatial correlation of intra-die device length variation. The analysis is then extended to include spatial correlation. We test the proposed methods on paths from an industrial high-performance microprocessor and present comparisons with traditional path analysis which does not distinguish between inter- and intra-die variations. The characteristics of the device length distributions were obtained from measured data of 8 test chips with a total of 17688 device length measurements.

In this paper, we investigate criteria of path selection for path delay testing. We first define two typical criteria to be investigated here, and then experimentally show the features of paths selected with each criterion, with respect to fault coverage of other delay fault models.

Two distinct features make the algorithm feasible for large functions. First, for an n-variable function, it checks only O(n<sup>2</sup>) candidates for decomposition out of O(2<sup>n</sup>) possible ones. A special strategy for selecting candidates makes it likely that all other decompositions are encoded in the selected ones. Second, the decompositions for the approved candidates are computed using a novel IntervalCut algorithm. This algorithm does not require re-ordering of ROBDD. The combination of both techniques allows us to decompose the functions of size beyond that possible with the exact algorithms. The experimental results on 582 benchmark functions show that the presented heuristic finds 95% of all decompositions on average. For 526 of those functions, it finds 100% of the decompositions.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195015","","Application software;Boolean functions;Computer network reliability;Computer science;Data structures;Embedded system;Game theory;Heuristic algorithms;Network synthesis;Reliability theory","Boolean functions;binary decision diagrams;logic CAD;set theory;trees (mathematics)","BDD-based heuristic algorithm;Boolean function;IntervalCut algorithm;ROBDD representation;disjoint decomposition;fast heuristic algorithm;logic synthesis;reduced-order BDD","","0","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To support this mechanism, a special data structure is established, in which no intermediate data has to be saved. Moreover, optimizations such as object reordering and merging are facilitated. Data starvation is avoided by overlapping data transfer with intensive computation so that applications with different complexity can be managed efficiently.

In this paper, we proposed a buffer planning algorithm based on dead space redistribution to make good use of dead-spaces for buffer insertion. Associated with circuit blocks under topological representations, the dead space can be redistributed by freely moving some circuit blocks within their rooms in the placement. The total area and the topology of the placement keep unchanged while doing the dead space redistribution. The number of nets satisfying the delay constraint can be increased by redistributing the dead space all over the placement, which has been demonstrated by experimental results. The increment of the number of nets that satisfy delay constraints is 9% on an average.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195055","","Circuit topology;Computer science;Delay;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Space technology;Technology planning;Timing;Very large scale integration;Wire","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;network topology","buffer insertion;buffer optimization;buffer planning;circuit block placement rooms;circuit topology;dead space redistribution;delay constraints;interconnect-centric floorplanning;placed circuit blocks;total topology area","","2","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This simplicity is realized by applying some basic assumptions on the form of the input excitations, and via separation of the nonlinearities from the dynamic behavior. In addition, by further separating the ideal model functionality, this macromodel is applicable to strongly nonlinear components such as mixers. While time-varying Volterra series models have been proposed for mixers with a fixed local oscillation (LO) signal, the proposed frequency separation model is completely general and can capture the variations of the LO input during a system-level simulation. The proposed macromodels are demonstrated in a system-level simulation tool based on Simulink for efficient evaluation of the entire RF system and associated components. A GSM receiver system in 0.25 μm CMOS process is used to demonstrate the efficacy of these macromodels in our system-level simulation environment.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195143","","Circuit simulation;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit noise;Kernel;Mathematical model;Predictive models;RF signals;Radio frequency;Semiconductor device modeling;Time varying systems","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Volterra series;analogue circuits;cellular radio;circuit simulation;integrated circuit modelling;mixers (circuits);nonlinear network analysis;radiofrequency integrated circuits","0.25 micron;CMOS;GSM receiver;LO input variations;RF circuit modeling;Volterra kernel calculations;analog circuits;device models;dynamic behavior;frequency separation macromodel;input excitations;local oscillation signal;mixers;nonlinear behavior;strongly nonlinear components;system-level macromodels;system-level simulation;time-varying Volterra series models","","0","","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our gate-delay model characterizes the statistical gate delay variation using a response surface method (RSM) according to the intra-chip and inter-chip variability of each transistor in a gate.

Traditionally, this step relies on the construction of a set of worse-case paths, based upon discrete timing models. However, the assumption of discrete timing models can be invalidated by timing defects and process variation in the deep sub-micron domain, which are often continuous in nature. As a result, critical paths defined in a traditional timing analysis approach may not be truly critical in reality. In this paper, we propose using a statistical delay evaluation framework for estimating the quality of a path set. Based upon the new framework, we demonstrate how the traditional definition of a critical path set may deviate from the true critical path set in the deep sub-micron domain. To remedy the problem, we discuss improvements to the existing path selection strategies by including new objectives. We then compare statistical approaches with traditional approaches based upon experimental analysis of both defect-free and defect-injected cases.","","0-7803-7659-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2003.1195120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195120","","Added delay;Circuit noise;Circuit testing;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Manufacturing processes;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Timing","correlation methods;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;statistical analysis;timing","AC delay test;critical path selection;defect-injection;discrete timing models;path correlation;path selection objectives;path selection strategies;path set quality estimation;process variation;statistical delay evaluation framework;statistical timing analysis;timing analysis;timing defects;timing validation;worse-case paths","","8","2","","","","21-24 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate the efficiency of different interconnect architectures, we assume mesh structures with uniform communication demand and develop a multi-commodity flow (MCF) approach to model the on-chip communication traffic. We also extend the combinatorial MCF algorithm of N. Garg and J. Konemann (Proc. 39th Annual Symp. on Foundations of Comp. Sci., pp. 300-309, 1998) to compute the optimal routing resource allocations for different interconnect architectures. The experiments show that: (1) compared with the Manhattan architecture, the Y-architecture demonstrates a throughput improvement of 30.7% for a square chip. The throughput of the Y-architecture is only 2.5% smaller than that of the X-architecture.

"FastRoute 2.0: A High-quality and Efficient Global Router","Min Pan; Chu, C.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA","Design Automation Conference, 2007. ASP-DAC '07.

Hence, high-quality and fast global routers are in great demand. In this paper, we propose two major techniques to improve the extremely fast global router, FastRoute (Pan and Chu, 2006) in terms of solution quality : (1) monotonic routing, (2) multi-source multi-sink maze routing. The new router is called FastRoute 2.0. Experimental results show that FastRoute 2.0 can generate high-quality routing solutions with fast runtime compared with three state-of-the-art academic global routers FastRoute, Labyrinth (Kastner et al., 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (Hadsell and Madden, 2003). On the set of benchmarks used in Pan and Chu, 2006 and Hadsell and Madden (2003), the total overflow of FastRoute 2.0 is 98, compared to 1012 (FastRoute), 2846 (Labyrinth) and 1271 (Chi Dispersion Router). The runtime of FastRoute 2.0 is 73% slower than FastRoute, but 78times and 37times faster than Labyrinth and Chi Dispersion router. The promising results make it possible to integrate global routing into early design stages. This could dramatically improve the design solution quality.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196040","","Clocks;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Runtime;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces;Wire","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","FastRoute 2.0;advanced IC technology;design solution quality;extremely fast global router;high-quality routing solutions;monotonic routing;multisource multisink maze routing","","38","1","19","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet the problem of selecting voltage levels for multiple voltage DVS systems remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we present a novel technique for dealing with the problem of finding k operating voltages to minimize the energy consumption (voltage set-up problem). A new formulation of the voltage set-up problem is given to make our solution less dependent on the specific DVS scheme. Then it is solved optimally using dynamic programming in polynomial time. With almost the same time complexity we extend the proposed technique to explore the design space to determine the best number of voltage levels. It is confirmed from the experiments that the proposed voltage set-up solution reduces energy consumption by 19.2% on average over that of previous technique (Buss et al., 2003).","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466472","","Circuits;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency;Minimization;Space exploration;Voltage control","circuit complexity;dynamic programming;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips","design space;dynamic programming;dynamic voltage scaled processors;energy consumption minimization;energy minimization technique;energy-efficient operating voltage set-up;polynomial time;time complexity;voltage set-up problem","","0","","9","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","355","360","In order to achieve timing closure on increasingly complex IC designs, buffer insertion needs to be performed on thousands of nets within an integrated physical synthesis system. In most of previous works, buffers may be inserted at any open space. Even when there may appear to be space for buffers in the alleys between large blocks, these regions are often densely packed or may be useful later to fix critical paths. In addition, a buffer solution may inadvertently force wires to go through routing congested regions. Therefore, within physical synthesis, a buffer insertion scheme needs to be aware of both placement congestion and routing congestion of the existing layout and so it has to be able to decide when to insert buffers in dense regions to achieve critical performance improvement and when to utilize the sparser regions of the chip. With the proposed Steiner tree adjustment technique, this work aims at finding congestion-aware buffered Steiner trees. Our tree adjustment technique takes a Steiner tree as input, modifies the tree and simultaneously handles the objectives of timing, placement and routing congestion. To our knowledge, this is the first study, which simultaneously considers these three objectives for the buffered Steiner tree problem. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm while it achieves up to 20x speed-up when comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm (C.J.

In this paper, we propose second-order iterative algorithms that can significantly reduce the runtime. The new algorithms are extremely fast, and we prove that they guarantee converge to the exact solutions. Experimental results show that our algorithms outperform the random-walk algorithm in (Qian et al., 2003) and algorithms in (Zhong and Wong, 2005), For a 25-million node problem, while the random-walk algorithm takes 2 days with maximum error of 6.1 mV, the fastest algorithm in (Zhong and Wong, 2005) takes 50 minutes, and our second-order row-based algorithm takes 32 minutes to get an exact solution. Moreover, we can get a solution with maximum error 2 mV in 10 minutes.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196128","","Circuits;Convergence;Grid computing;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Optical computing;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power grids;Runtime","integrated circuit design;iterative methods;power grids","10 mins;2 mV;32 mins;50 mins;6.1 mV;IR drop analysis;first-order iterative algorithms;node-by-node traversals;power grid;random-walk method;row-by-row traversals;second-order iterative methods","","5","","5","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bus architecture displays several advantages such as, high bandwidth, low latency, and low performance penalty from arbitration delay, all of which make it more scalable than traditional buses. However, its scalability may be limited by the bus access logic delay. As a module is connected to the bus through its interface unit, which is connected in series on the bus, the bus logic delay increases linearly as the bus size increases. In this paper, we propose to increase the scalability of SAMBA buses through two methods: control signal lookahead and module clustering. The control signal lookahead technique can determine the bus access control signal in advance, thereby reducing the effective delay of each interface unit. Module clustering, on the other hand, can reduce the number of interface units attached to a bus. Experimental results show that combining these two methods can effectively reduce the bus logic delay, and thus increase the scalability of SAMBA buses.","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466548","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466548","","Access control;Bandwidth;Circuit testing;Delay effects;Delay lines;Displays;Logic;Multiplexing;Scalability;System-on-a-chip","delays;integrated circuit design;system buses;system-on-chip","SAMBA bus;bus access control signal;bus access logic delay;bus architecture;bus scalability;bus size;control signal lookahead;module clustering;multiple transactions;single-winner bus arbitration","","3","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Practically, we propose a hierarchical multi-point reduction scheme for high-fidelity, wideband modeling of general passive or active linear circuits. A novel explicit waveform matching algorithm is proposed for searching the dominant poles and residues from different expansion points based on the unique hierarchical reduction framework.

However, how to take advantage of the local static slack for further energy optimization remains as an open problem. In this paper, we propose the static power management with proportional distribution and parallelism scheme (PDP-SPM) that not only answers this open problem, but also exploits the parallelism.
