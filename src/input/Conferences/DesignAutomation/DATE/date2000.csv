"Designing closer to the edge [deep submicron processes]","Nassif, S.R.","IBM Austin Res. Lab., TX, USA","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 2000. Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","636","637","Summary form only given. Modern deep submicron CMOS processes cost Θ or more to develop, qualify and deploy. Yet the incremental impact of each technology generation has been steadily decreasing due to a variety of phenomena such as increasing wire delay, power dissipation and reliability limits, and increasing process tolerances. We need to make better use of existing and future manufacturing processes in order to recoup our investment. It is often possible to obtain more performance out of an existing technology by better understanding of the process tolerances and trading off functional yield vs. performance. Given the above, it is clear that we need to understand and model design tolerances arising from processing variations. Until recently, it was sufficient to model such process-induced variations as intra-die shifts in device performance. However, in the deep submicron regime, within-die wire and device variations are comparable to die-to-die variations. This results in the need for new characterization, modeling and analysis techniques to handle these variations. In this work we expand on the ideas above, review the important trends in design uncertainty which directly drives design tolerance and hence performance. We review a number of research and applied approaches to design for manufacturability. The need to track process tolerances as a technology matures is stressed. This tracking is important since it acts as an information conduit between design and fabrication groups and enables designers to adapt the design to lower tolerances where possible","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840852","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Costs;Delay;Investments;Manufacturing processes;Power dissipation;Power generation;Uncertainty;Wire","CMOS integrated circuits;design for manufacture;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit technology;tolerance analysis","DFM;deep submicron CMOS processes;design for manufacturability;design tolerances;functional yield;manufacturing processes;process tolerances;process-induced variations","","0","","2","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Efficient power co-estimation techniques for system-on-chip design","Lajolo, M.; Raghunathan, A.; Dey, S.; Lavagno, L.","Politecnico di Torino, Italy","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 2000. Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","27","34","We present efficient power estimation techniques for HW/SW System-On-Chip (SOC) designs. Our techniques are based on concurrent and synchronized execution of multiple power estimators that analyze different parts of the SOC (we refer to this as co-estimation), driven by a system-level simulation master. We motivate the need for power co-estimation, and demonstrate that performing independent power estimation for the various system components can lead to significant errors in the power estimates, especially for control-intensive and reactive embedded systems. We observe that the computation time for performing power co-estimation is dominated by: (i) the requirement to analyze/simulate some parts of the system at lower levels of abstraction in order to obtain accurate estimates of timing and switching activity information and (ii) the need to communicate between and synchronize the various simulators. Thus, a naive implementation of power co-estimation may be too inefficient to be used in an iterative design exploration framework. To address this issue, we present several acceleration (speedup) techniques for power co-estimation. The acceleration techniques are energy caching, software power macromodeling, and statistical sampling. Our speedup techniques reduce the workload of the power estimators for the individual SOC components, as well as their communication/synchronization overhead. Experimental results indicate that the use of the proposed acceleration techniques results in significant (8× to 87×) speedups in SOC power estimation time, with minimal impact on accuracy. We also show the utility of our co-estimation tool to explore system-level power tradeoffs for a TCP/IP network interface card sub-system and an automotive controller","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840011","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Control systems;Embedded system;Error correction;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Performance analysis;System-on-a-chip","application specific integrated circuits;circuit simulation;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;iterative methods;low-power electronics","TCP/IP network interface card sub-system;automotive controller;communication/synchronization overhead;computation time;concurrent execution;energy caching;hardware-software codesign;iterative design exploration;power co-estimation techniques;reactive embedded systems;software power macromodeling;statistical sampling;switching activity information;synchronized execution;system-level power tradeoffs;system-level simulation master;system-on-chip design","","17","","23","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Arithmetic coprocessors (AC) are quite complex circuits and testing them is an important and not easy problem (not covered in the literature). Analyzing diagnostic software for IBM PCs we found that the testing procedures for ACs are limited to simple basic checks. Hence we decided to develop efficient test procedures in a systematic way. They are executed on the main processor and generate appropriate stimuli to AC functional blocks (e.g. instruction sequencer, data path units) and verify test responses.

The current behaviour can be divided into two parts: (1) a circuit dependent one, which has a major contribution, and affects equally all the devices in a given die, and (2) a smaller die dependent fraction due to variations, defective and non-defective, of each of the devices of a specific die.

SAT has been typically applied to EDA as follows: (1) formulation of the given problem as a SAT instance (2) solution of the SAT instance. In this paper we present a method to simultaneously solve several closely related SAT instances using incremental satisfiability (ISAT). In ISAT, the decision sequence made for a “prefix” function is used to solve another set of functions which have a number of new constraints (extensions) added to the prefix function. Our experiments show that we can achieve significant gains in total runtime when we use this methodology as opposed to resetting the decision sequences and solving each instance from scratch. Application of ISAT to delay fault testing is presented by formulating incremental path sensitization as an ISAT problem.

This is achieved by overlapping execution of one temporal partition with the reconfiguration of another, using the processors partial reconfiguration capability. We have incorporated block-processing in the partitioning framework for reducing reconfiguration overhead of partitioned designs. A highlight of our partitioner is it's ability to handle loops and conditional constructs in the input specification. The proposed methodology was tested on several examples on the Xilinx 6200 FPGA.

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","715","722","Power dissipated during test application is substantially higher than power dissipated during functional operation which can decrease the reliability and lead to yield loss. This paper presents a new technique for power minimization during test application in full scan sequential circuits. The technique is based on classifying scan latches into compatible, incompatible and independent scan latches. Based on their classification, scan latches are partitioned into multiple scan chains. A new test application strategy which applies an extra test vector to primary inputs while shifting out test responses for each scan chain, minimizes power dissipation by eliminating the spurious transitions which occur in the combinational part of the circuit. Unlike previous approaches which are test vector and scan latch order dependent and hence are not able to handle large circuits due to the complexity of the design space, this paper shows that with low test area and test data overhead substantial savings in power dissipation during test application are achieved in a very low computational time. For example, in the case of benchmark circuit s15850 it takes <3600s in computational time and <1% in test area and test data overhead to achieve 80% savings in power dissipation","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840866","","Automatic testing;Circuit testing;Electronic equipment testing;Latches;Logic testing;Minimization;Power dissipation;Sequential analysis;Sequential circuits;System testing","automatic testing;design for testability;flip-flops;integrated circuit testing;integrated logic circuits;logic partitioning;logic testing;low-power electronics;minimisation;sequential circuits","full scan sequential circuits;large circuits;multiple scan chains;power dissipation;power minimization;scan latch partitioning;test application","","6","2","22","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contrary to most placement algorithms that minimize a global cost function based on an abstract representation of the design, we decomposed the placement function into a set of transforms and coupled them directly with incremental timing, noise, and/or power analyzers. This coupling results in a direct and more accurate feedback on optimizations for placement actions. These placement transforms are then integrated with traditional logic synthesis transforms leading to a converging set of optimizations based on the concurrent manipulation of boolean, electrical, as well as physical data. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach creates an efficient converging design flow that eliminates placement and synthesis iteration. It results in timing improvements, and maintains other global placement measures such as wire congestion and wire length. The flexibility of the transformational approach allows us to easily add, extend and support more sophisticated algorithms that involve critical as well as non-critical regions and target a variety of metrics including noise, yield and manufacturability:","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840038","","Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Cost function;Feedback;Length measurement;Logic;Noise measurement;Power measurement;Timing;Wire","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD","converging design flow;logic synthesis;physical placement;placement function decomposition;transformational placement/synthesis;transforms","","19","4","25","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a technique that tightly links the logic and physical domains-we combine logic and placement optimization in a single step. The combined algorithm is based on simulation annealing and hence, very amenable to new optimization goals or constraints. Two types of moves, directed towards global reduction in the cost function (linear congestion), are accepted by the simulated annealing algorithm: (1) logic optimization steps consisting of removing or replacing redundant wires in a circuit using functional flexibilities derived from SPFDs and (2) the placement optimization steps consisting of swapping a pair of blocks in the FPGA. Feedback from placement is very valuable in making an informed choice of a target wire during logic optimization moves.

This abstract modeling of the underlying reconfigurable computer poses complex challenges to the synthesis and partitioning tools. Since the design specification is not constrained by the number of memory segments on the board or the number of pins between FPGAs, it is difficult for the CAD tools to transform the design into one that maps onto the multi-FPGA board. This paper describes an arbitration mechanism that bridges the abstraction between the implicit design and the reconfigurable architecture. Since this mechanism allows such architecture abstraction between the design and the board, it becomes easier to port a design from one target architecture to another.

In particular synchronous dataflow (SDF) has been found to be a particularly good match for expressing multirate signal processing systems. One of the key problems that arises during synthesis from an SDF specification is scheduling. Past work on scheduling from SDF has focused on optimization of program memory and buffer memory. However, no attempt was made for overlaying or sharing buffers. In this paper we formally tackle the problem of generating optimally compact schedules for SDF graphs, that also attempt to minimize buffering memory under the assumption that buffers will be shared.

The problem of estimating lower bounds on the power consumption in scheduled data flow graphs with a fixed number of allocated resources prior to binding is addressed.

This paper presents the design of a turbo decoder with high performances in terms of throughput implemented using TSPC (true single phase clocking) logic family. In order to achieve the best compromise between cost (in terms of area) and throughput, several architectural solutions have been analyzed. The whole system and in particular its core, the SISO module, has been verified through VHDL simulations. HSPICE simulations show that the system can operate with a 1 GHz clock and thus it can reach a throughput of 50 Mbit/s","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840035","","Bit error rate;Clocks;Costs;Delay;Iterative decoding;Logic design;Performance gain;Signal to noise ratio;Throughput;Turbo codes","SPICE;VLSI;circuit simulation;digital integrated circuits;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;iterative decoding;turbo codes","1 GHz;50 Mbit/s;HSPICE simulations;SISO module;VHDL simulations;architectural solutions;bit error rate;coding gains;decoding delay;iterative turbo-decoder;signal to noise ratios;throughput;true single phase clocking","","3","8","11","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","679","684","Simulation is still one of the most important subtasks when designing a VLSI circuit. However more and more elements on a chip increase simulation runtimes. Especially on transistor level with highly accurate element modelling, long simulation runtimes of typically several hours delay the design process. One possibility to reduce these runtimes is to divide the circuit into several partitions and to simulate the partitions in parallel. But the success of such a parallel simulation is heavily dependent on the quality of the partitioning. This paper presents a new approach for partitioning VLSI circuits on transistor level and gives runtimes of parallel simulations of large industrial circuits. The resulting runtimes show considerable improvement compared to a known partitioning method, the node tearing method","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840860","","Circuit simulation;Costs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hip;Newton method;Partitioning algorithms;Runtime;Transistors;Very large scale integration;Workstations","VLSI;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;logic partitioning","VLSI circuits;industrial circuits;parallel simulation;partitioning method;simulation runtimes;subtasks;transistor level","","2","","12","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","372","378","Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) has attracted more and more interest during recent years, since it has proved to be an attractive alternative to static CMOS designs with respect to area, performance and power consumption. Existing automatic PTL synthesis tools use a direct mapping of (decomposed) BDDs to pass transistors. Thereby, structural properties of BDDs like the ordering restriction and the fact that the select signals of the multiplexers (corresponding to BDD nodes) directly depend on input variables, are imposed on PTL circuits although they are not necessary for PTL synthesis. General multiplexer circuits can be used instead and should provide a much higher potential for optimization compared to a pure BDD approach. Nevertheless-to the best of our knowledge-an optimization of general Multiplexer Circuits (MCs) for PTL synthesis has not been tried so far due to a lack of suitable optimization approaches. In this paper we present such an algorithm which is based on efficient BDD optimization techniques. Our experiments prove that there is indeed a high optimization potential by the use of general MCs-both concerning area and depth of the resulting PTL networks","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840298","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;CMOS logic circuits;Circuit synthesis;Data structures;Energy consumption;Logic circuits;Logic design;Multiplexing;Signal synthesis","binary decision diagrams;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated logic circuits;logic CAD;minimisation of switching nets","BDD optimization techniques;automatic PTL synthesis;multiplexer circuits;pass transistor logic synthesis","","9","","23","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A class of faults that are undetectable in an integrated test by traditional means is identified. These faults create faulty but functional circuits.

The algorithm takes benefit from a fast multi-layer critical area computation to extract the rectangles that compose it. Afterwards, the extracted rectangles are involved into the layer minimization process which is the second phase of the compaction procedure to minimize their area.

However, BDD-related SAT techniques suffer from size explosion problems. This paper presents two BDD-based algorithms to solve the SAT problem that attempt to contain the growth of BDD-size while identifying solutions quickly. The first algorithm, called BSAT, is a recursive, backtracking algorithm that uses an exhaustive search to find a SAT solution. The well known unate recursive paradigm is exploited to solve the SAT problem. The second algorithm is exploited to solve the SAT problem. The second algorithm, called INCOMPLETE-SEARCH-USAT (abbreviated IS-USAT), incorporates an incomplete search to find a solution. The search is incomplete inasmuch as it is restricted to only those regions that have a high likelihood of containing the solution, discarding the rest. Using our techniques we were able to find SAT solutions not only for all MCNC&ISCAS benchmarks, but also for a variety of industry standard designs","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840044","","Automatic test pattern generation;Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuits;Data structures;Engines;Iterative algorithms;Read only memory;Testing","VLSI;binary decision diagrams;circuit CAD;computational complexity;integrated circuit design;standards","BDD-based satisfiability infrastructure;INCOMPLETE-SEARCH-USAT;backtracking algorithm;binary decision diagrams;exhaustive search;industry standard designs;size explosion problems;unate recursive paradigm","","2","1","26","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","606","611","The problem of power management for an embedded system is to reduce system level power dissipation by shutting off parts of the system when they are not being used and turning them back on when they are required. Algorithms for this problem are online in nature where the algorithm must operate without access to the complete data set or its characteristics. In this paper, we present online algorithms to manage power for embedded systems and provide experimental analysis to back up the theoretical results. Specifically, this paper makes four contributions. We propose an optimal online algorithm for power management. We present an analysis of algorithmic efficiency using a technique called competitive analysis which is particularly suitable for online algorithms. Using this analysis technique, we develop a lower bound for the non-adaptive version of the power management problem and show that our algorithm achieves this lower bound. Next, we explore adaptive algorithms that try to shut down the system based on historical data. We provide a lower bound for any algorithm that uses adaptive methods to manage power. We also propose an algorithm that is independent of the input data distribution, practical and usable in both hardware and software systems with guaranteed performance. Finally, we compare these algorithms with previously proposed heuristics both theoretically and experimentally. For the experiments, we model the disk drive of a laptop computer as an embedded system. The results show that the proposed algorithms perform well in practice with guaranteed bounds on their performance. Further, this paper conclusively demonstrates that to implement aggressive power management techniques for power critical subsystems, designers will have to commit greater resources such as dedicated registers and ALU units","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840847","","Adaptive algorithm;Algorithm design and analysis;Embedded system;Energy management;Hardware;Power dissipation;Power system management;Software algorithms;Software systems;Turning","VLSI;computer power supplies;embedded systems;low-power electronics","VLSI;adaptive algorithms;algorithmic efficiency;competitive analysis;disk drive;embedded system;input data distribution;power critical subsystems;power dissipation;power management algorithms;system level online power management","","12","","16","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such an expression can be implemented by a three-level Programmable Logic Device (PLD) consisting of PLA 1 and PLA2, implementing the first two levels of logic, and a set of two-input logic expanders, implementing the third level. Each logic expander can be programmed to realize any function of two variables. PLDs of this type seem to give a good trade-off between the speed of a flat PLA and density of a multi-level network of PLAs.

High noise immunity and level-restoring capabilities of static CMOS gates, combined with small area and low power of PTL cells, make a mixed CMOS/PTL design style an ideal alternative to the all-CMOS technology. However, the synthesis of mixed CMOS/PTL circuits imposes a great challenge to the existing synthesis methodology. Neither traditional techniques based on algebraic factorization nor methods based on direct BDD mapping are applicable to this new circuit style. We have recently proposed a new BDD-based logic optimization method for static CMOS. It is based on iterative BDD decomposition using various dominators which correspond to decomposable BDD structures leading to AND, OR, XOR and MUX decompositions. Synthesis results show that the method is very efficient for both AND/OR- and XOR-intensive functions. Since PTL structures can be easily identified on a BDD, our method can be readily extended to perform logic decomposition leading to mixed CMOS/PTL logic implementation. In contrast to other PTL synthesis techniques, based on direct BDD mapping, our method is not limited to decomposition onto PLTs only; its logic decomposition and optimization is driven by the capabilities of both the static CMOS and PTL logic. Our BDD decomposition method can also account for various parameters associated with circuit performance, thus avoiding drawbacks of direct BDD mapping-based synthesis, such as large fanouts and long transistor chains","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840883","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Data structures;Noise level;Optimization methods","CMOS logic circuits;binary decision diagrams;circuit optimisation;logic design","AND decompositions;BDD-based logic optimization method;MUX decompositions;OR decompositions;XOR decompositions;decomposable BDD structures;iterative BDD decomposition;mixed CMOS/PTL circuit synthesis;mixed CMOS/PTL design style;pass transistor logic","","3","","5","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","624","631","Designs which do not fully utilize their arithmetic datapath components typically exhibit a significant overhead in power consumption. Whenever a module performs an operation whose result is not used in the downstream circuit, power is being consumed for an otherwise redundant computation. Operand isolation is a technique to minimize the power overhead incurred by redundant operations by selectively blocking the propagation of switching activity through the circuit. This paper discusses how redundant operations can be identified concurrently to normal circuit operation, and presents a model to estimate the power savings that can be obtained by isolation of selected modules at the register-transfer (RT) level. Based on this model, an algorithm is presented to iteratively isolate modules, while minimizing the cost incurred by RTL operand isolation.

Embedded software is characterized by a relatively long lifetime and by tight cost, performance and safety constraints. Several super-optimization techniques for embedded softwares based on multi-valued decision diagram (MDD) representations have been described in the literature, but they all share the same basic limitation. They are based on standard ordered MDD (OMDD) packages, and hence require a used order of evaluation for the MDD variables on every execution path. Free MDDs (FMDDs) lift this limitation, and hence open up more optimization opportunities. Finding the optimal variable ordering for FMDDs is a very difficult problem. Hence in this paper we describe a heuristic procedure that performs well in practice, and is based on FMDD cost estimation applied to recursive cofactoring.

The most compelling reason for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to be accepted in the state-of-the-art CAD flow is its ability to perform design space exploration. Design space exploration requires efficient scheduling techniques that have a low complexity and yet produce good quality schedules. The Time-Constrained Scheduling (TCS) problem minimizes the number of functional units required to schedule a particular Data Flow Graph (DFG) within a specified number of time steps. Over the past few years a number of techniques have been proposed to solve the TCS problem. Heuristic list scheduling algorithms have been widely used for their low-complexity and good performance. The complexity of a dynamic-list scheduling algorithm, such as the Force Directed Scheduling (FDS), is Θ(T*N<sup>2</sup>), where T is the time constraint and N is the number of operations. Static-list scheduling algorithms are the least complex among the known class of scheduling techniques with a linear time complexity of Θ(T*N). Typically, static-list scheduling algorithms, in order to maintain low-complexity, do not perform any look-ahead like that of FDS. The drawback is that, static-list scheduling algorithms may not generate high-quality schedules. However, the proposed static-list algorithm presented here incorporates a novel topological clustering technique which acts as the look-ahead mechanism without any computational overhead","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840882","","Clustering algorithms;Cost function;High level synthesis;Optimal scheduling;Parallel processing;Processor scheduling;Rubber;Scheduling algorithm;Space exploration;Time factors","computational complexity;data flow graphs;high level synthesis;scheduling","CAD;DFG;HLS;data flow graph;design space exploration;high-level synthesis;high-quality schedules;linear time complexity;look-ahead mechanism;low complexity;schedule quality improvement;static-list time-constrained scheduling;topological clustering technique","","0","","5","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They directly influence the bit-error-rate performance of communication links. It is desirable to predict the rate of occasional detection errors and the loss of synchronization due to the non-ideal operation of such circuits. In high-speed data networks, the bit-error-rate specification on the system can be very stringent, i.e., 10<sup>-14</sup>. It is not feasible to predict such error rates with straightforward, simulation based, approaches. This work introduces a stochastic model and an efficient, analysis-based, non-Monte-Carlo method for performance evaluation of digital data and clock recovery circuits. The analyzed circuit is modeled as finite state machines with inputs described as functions on a Markov chain state-space. System performance measures, such as probability of bit errors and rate of synchronization loss, can be evaluated through the analysis of a larger resulting Markov system.

To achieve better features and performance, some PDES protocols assume that simultaneous events may be processed in arbitrary order. We describe a solution of how to apply these algorithms to have a correct simulation of the distributed VHDL cycle, including the delta cycle. The solution is based on tie-breaking the simultaneous events using Lamport's logical clocks to causally order them according to the VHDL simulation cycle, and defining the VHDL virtual time as a pair of simulation physical time and cycle/phase logical time. The paper also shows how to use this method with a PDES protocol that relaxes the simulation of simultaneous events to arbitrary order; allowing the LPs to self-adapt to optimistic or conservative mode, without the lookahead requirement. The lookahead is application-dependent and for some systems may be zero or unknown.

The sensor element is stimulated using a pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS). The sensor signal is read out and the analog output is digitized using a ΣΔ-modulator. The binary pulse density stream of the ΣΔ-modulator is the output of the sensor system and thus should ideally contain the PRBS. A matched filter has the task of detecting the pseudo random sequence in the pulse density stream and its sampled output is compared to a threshold thus making it possible to judge the functionality of the sensor element. By evaluating the magnitude of the matched filter output it is also possible to measure the sensor sensitivity. We present a discrete solution of this method, but an integrated chip using a standard 1.2 μm CMOS process has been designed and is being fabricated","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840846","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840846","","Error correction;Fault detection;Intelligent sensors;Matched filters;Mathematical model;Redundancy;Safety;Sensor systems;System performance;Temperature sensors","CMOS integrated circuits;error detection;fault location;intelligent sensors;matched filters;sensitivity;sigma-delta modulation;temperature sensors","ΣΔ-modulation;1.2 micron;CMOS integrated chip;PRBS stimulation;binary pulse density stream;defective sensor elements detection;integrable solution;matched filter;pseudo random binary sequence;sampled output comparison;sensor sensitivity;sigma-delta modulation;smart sensor system","","0","","4","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nonlinear nature of the analog front-end blocks is a complication for their modeling at the architectural level, especially when the nonlinear behavior is frequency dependent. This paper describes a method to derive a bottom-up model of nonlinear analog continuous-time circuits used in communication systems. The models take into account frequency dependence of the nonlinear behavior, making them suitable for wideband applications. Such model consists of a block diagram that corresponds to the most important contributions to the second- and third-order Volterra kernels of the output quantity (voltage or current) of a circuit. The examples in this paper, a high-level model of a CMOS low-noise amplifier and an active lowpass filter, demonstrate that the generated models can be efficiently evaluated in high-level dataflow-type simulations of mixed-signal front-ends and that they yield insight in the nonlinear behavior of the analog front-end blocks","","0-7695-0537-6","","10.1109/DATE.2000.840295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840295","","Active filters;Circuit simulation;Frequency dependence;Kernel;Low-noise amplifiers;Nonlinear distortion;Semiconductor device modeling;Transceivers;Voltage;Wideband","active filters;analogue integrated circuits;circuit simulation;continuous time systems;integrated circuit modelling;nonlinear distortion;nonlinear network analysis;radiofrequency amplifiers;transceivers","CMOS LNA;active lowpass filter;analog front-ends;analogue communication circuits;architectural level simulation;bottom-up model;compact modeling;dataflow-type simulations;digital telecommunication transceivers;frequency dependence;high-level model;low-noise amplifier;nonlinear behavior;nonlinear continuous-time circuits;nonlinear distortion;second-order Volterra kernel;third-order Volterra kernel;wideband applications","","11","1","7","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transformations attempt to achieve minimal code execution within loops and reduced operator strengths.

"Wire-sizing for delay minimization and ringing control using transmission line model","Gao, Y.; Wong, D.F.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings","20020806","2000","","","512","516","In this paper, we consider continuous wire-sizing optimization for delay minimization and ringing control. The optimization is based on a fast and accurate delay estimation method under a finite ramp input, where an analytical expression is also derived to estimate overshoot/undershoot voltage. In this paper we specify the wire shape to be of the form f(x)=ae<sup>-bx</sup>, since previous studies under the Elmore delay model suggest that exponential wire shape is effective for delay minimization. The relevant transmission line equations are solved by using the Picard-Carson method. The transient response in the time domain is derived as a function of a and b. The coefficients a and b are then determined such that either the actual delay (50% delay) is minimized, or the wiring area is minimized subject to a delay bound. At the same time, the overshoot/undershoot voltage is bounded to prevent false switching. Our method for delay estimation is very efficient. In all the experiments we performed, it is far more accurate than the Elmore delay model and the estimated delay values are very close to SPICE's results.

This assumption leads to the well known Software Defined Radio concept which enables the implementation and the deployment of different waveforms on the same platform. This concept has been widely investigated since the early 2000's mainly for processors and Sw approach but less for reconfigurable Hw or DSP implementation. This paper deals with a specific architecture and an innovative design methodology which were designed within the framework of a fully flexible high data rate Software Defined Radio wireless modem. This approach is focused on the waveform part of the system and its goal is to reach a fully flexible physical layer. In case of modem evolutions or upgrades, it enables to avoid significant rework and extra cost in term of waveform development. Moreover the association of the right architecture and the right methodology allows to master and to manage the complexity of the modem (which presents several hundred configurations available with different kind of parameters) and permits to provide the needed flexibility. The development methodology is based on a C/C++ approach which allows to manage all the parameters at a system level. The architecture coupled to this development methodology offers a high level of modularity which enables to easily modify the waveform only in replacing blocks by other blocks. The efficiency and the flexibility of the modem is then obtained by designing not a single waveform but a waveforms family.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-3781-8","","10.1109/DATE.2009.5090817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090817","FPGA;Physical layer;Software Defined radio (SDR);architecture;flexibility;high data rate modem;high level synthesis;mobile and wireless communication;modularity","Application software;Communication standards;Computer architecture;Costs;Design methodology;Mobile communication;Modems;Physical layer;Software radio;Wireless communication","C++ language;digital signal processing chips;modems;reconfigurable architectures;software radio;telecommunication computing","C approach;C++ approach;DSP implementation;advanced configurable architecture;high data rate fully flexible SDR modem;mobile communication network;reconfigurable hardware approach;reconfigurable software approach;software defined radio wireless modem;wireless communication network","","1","","3","","","20-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If these global wires are optimally segmented and buffered, their delay is linear in the path length and independent of the position of the modules along these paths. From timing requirements, the total budget left to modules after allocating the appropriate delay to the wires can be determined. This paper describes how this budget can be optimally divided amongst the modules. A novel, static timing-like, mathematical programming formulation is introduced such that the total module area is minimized. Instead of only the worst delay, all pin-to-pin delays are implicitly taken into account. If area-delay tradeoffs are convex, a reasonable approximation in practice, the program can be solved efficiently. Further, efficiency of different formulations is discussed, and a low-cost method of making the budget relatively immune to downstream uncertainties and surprises is presented.

This paper focuses on a major aspect of moving running tasks to free space for new incoming tasks (compaction). We study the effect of compacting running tasks to free more contiguous space on the system performance. First, we introduce a straightforward compaction strategy called blind compaction. We use its performance as a reference to measure the performance of other compaction algorithms. Then we propose a two-dimensional compaction algorithm called one-corner compaction. This algorithm runs with respect to one chip corner. We further extend this algorithm to the four corners of the chip and introduce the 4-corner compaction algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance of these algorithms with some existing compaction strategies (Diessel, 2000). The simulation results show improvement in average task allocation time when using the 4-corner compaction algorithm by 15% and in chip utilization by 16% over the blind compaction.

The original FV-based low-power cache design aimed at only reducing dynamic power, at the cost of a 5% slowdown. We propose a better design that reduces both static and dynamic cache power, and that uses a circuit design that eliminates performance overhead. A designer can utilize our architecture by simulating an application and then synthesizing the FVs into an application-specific cache design when values will not change, or by simulating and then writing to an FV-cache with configuration registers when values could change. Furthermore, we describe hardware that can dynamically determine FVs and write to the configuration registers completely transparently.

This issue constitutes a major drawback with respect to software-centric acceleration platforms and approaches.

However, more accurate evaluations are needed to validate such solutions for hardware faults in real-world processor designs. In this paper, we evaluate SWAT's symptom-based detectors on gate-level faults using an FPGA-based, full-system prototype. With this platform, we performed a gate-level accurate fault injection campaign of 51,630 fault injections in the OpenSPARC T1 core logic across five SPECInt 2000 benchmarks. With an overall SDC rate of 0.79%, our results are comparable to previous microarchitecture-level evaluations of SWAT, demonstrating the effectiveness of symptom-based software detectors for permanent faults in real-world designs.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176660","","Circuit faults;Detectors;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Logic gates;Microarchitecture;Software","circuit reliability;fault diagnosis;field programmable gate arrays;logic gates;microprocessor chips;microsensors;network synthesis","FPGA-based full-system prototype;OpenSPARC Tl core logic;SDC rate;SPECInt 2000 benchmark;SWAT symptom-based software detector evaluation;crash testing;fault coverage;fault injection;fragile component;gate-level accurate fault injection campaign;gate-level fault evaluation;hardware fault detection solution;hardware reliability solution;microarchitecture-level evaluation;microarchitecture-level simulation;microprocessor core;processor design;silent data corruption rate;software anomaly treatment;software-level symptom monitoring;symptom-based resiliency solution","","6","","13","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Closed-loop control for power and thermal management in multi-core processors: Formal methods and industrial practice","Elfadel, Ibrahim M.; Marculescu, Radu; Atienza, David","Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1879","1881","The need to use feedback to come up with context-dependent and workload-aware strategies for runtime power and thermal management (PTM) in high-end and mobile processors has been advocated since the early 2000. Two seminal papers that appeared in 2002 [1], [2] defined a framework for the use of feedback mechanisms for power and temperature control. In [1], the focus was on power management with the goal being to extend battery life on the AMD Mobile Athlon. This was one of the earliest papers to use DVFS settings as actuators to guarantee a given energy level in the battery at the end of a given time interval. The controller was implemented using a combination of OS files and Linux kernel modules. Almost simultaneously, [2] posed the dynamic thermal management task as a formal control-theoretic problem requiring the thermal modeling of the processor and the use of the established control structures of classical feedback theory. Some of the defining features of [2] include the development of layout-based thermal RC models for the processor; the use of an architecturally-driven control mechanism, namely, the instruction fetching rate; and the use of the SPEC2000 benchmarks to illustrate temperature control action under various workloads. The controller used in [2] is a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) structure whose input is the deviation of the sensed temperature from the target temperature and whose output is the toggle rate of the instruction fetching mechanism.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513820","","Adaptation models;Integrated circuit modeling;Multicore processing;Program processors;Temperature control;Thermal management","","","","0","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Functional units with conditional input/output behavior in VLIW processors","Bekooij, M.J.G.; Engels, L.J.M.; van der Werf, A.; Busa, G.","Philips Res. Lab., Eindhoven, Netherlands","Design, Automation and Test in Europe, 2001. Conference and Exhibition 2001. Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","822","","Summary form only given. In this paper we extend the method to deal with coarse-grain operations in static scheduled VLIW processors as is introduced by Busa (2000). We allow functional units with a controller that does not traverse its states in a predefined way. This makes it possible to execute a function that contains a conditional construct like an if-statement as a single operation on a functional unit. In this way the performance penalty otherwise caused by branch instructions is reduced. By adding valid input and output signals, the problem is circumvented that during compilation it is, for this type of functional unit, not known when and how many samples will be consumed or produced. We refer to these units as Conditional Input/output Units (CIUs). The operations that are executed on CIUs are called Conditional Input/output Operations (CIOs). The difference with guarded operations is that the production of a result of a CIO depends on the state of the CIU","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915171","","Processor scheduling;Read-write memory;Registers;VLIW","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel machines","VLIW processors;branch instructions;coarse-grain operation;conditional construct;conditional input/output behavior;conditional input/output units;controller;functional units;if-statement;static scheduled processors","","0","","2","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the system completely powered by an energy harvester for autonomous operation, the power management becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose an ultra low power management circuit implemented in 0.18µm CMOS technology. As part of a stringent power requirements and very limited power offered by the energy harvesters, the proposed circuit provides a nanowatt power management scheme. Using post-layout simulation, we have evaluated the power consumption of the proposed power management unit (PMU) and report results that compares favorably to the state of the art.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513695","","Capacitors;Clocks;Low-power electronics;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Threshold voltage;Transistors","","","","1","","11","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
