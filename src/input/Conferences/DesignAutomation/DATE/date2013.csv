"Substitute-and-simplify: A unified design paradigm for approximate and quality configurable circuits","Venkataramani, Swagath; Roy, Kaushik; Raghunathan, Anand","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1367","1372","Many applications are inherently resilient to inexactness or approximations in their underlying computations. Approximate circuit design is an emerging paradigm that exploits this inherent resilience to realize hardware implementations that are highly efficient in energy or performance. In this work, we propose Substitute-And-SIMplIfy (SASIMI), a new systematic approach to the design and synthesis of approximate circuits. The key insight behind SASIMI is to identify signal pairs in the circuit that assume the same value with high probability, and substitute one for the other. While these substitutions introduce functional approximations, if performed judiciously, they result in some logic to be eliminated from the circuit while also enabling downsizing of gates on critical paths (simplification), resulting in significant power savings. We propose an automatic synthesis framework that performs substitution and simplification iteratively, while ensuring that a user-specified quality constraint is satisfied. We extend the proposed framework to perform automatic synthesis of quality configurable circuits that can dynamically operate at different accuracy levels depending on application requirements. We used SASIMI to automatically synthesize approximate and quality configurable implementations of a wide range of arithmetic units (Adders, Multipliers, MAC), complex data paths (SAD, FFT butterfly, Euclidean distance) and ISCAS85 benchmarks, using various error metrics such as error rate and average error magnitude. The synthesized approximate circuits demonstrate power improvements of 10%–28% for tight error constraints, and 30%–60% for relaxed error constraints. The quality configurable circuits obtain between 14%–40% improvement in energy in the approximate mode, while incurring no energy overheads in the accurate mode.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513726","Approximate Circuits;Approximate Computing;Logic Synthesis;Low Power Design","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Error analysis;Logic gates","","","","4","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, a new approach called σ-Iddq duagnosis is proposed for reinterpreting original data and diagnosing failing chips, intelligently. The overall flow consists of two key components, (1) σ-Iddq transformation and (2) defect-syndrome matching: σ-Iddq transformation first manifests defect leakages by excluding both the process-variation and design-scaling impacts. Later, defect-syndrome matching applies data mining with a pre-built library to identify types and locations of defects on the fly.

"Capital cost-aware design and partial shading-aware architecture optimization of a reconfigurable photovoltaic system","Wang, Yanzhi; Lin, Xue; Pedram, Massoud; Kim, Jaemin; Chang, Naehyuck","University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA 90089","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","909","912","Photovoltaic (PV) systems are often subject to partial shading that significantly degrades the output power of the whole systems. Reconfiguration methods have been proposed to adaptively change the PV panel configuration according to the current partial shading pattern. The reconfigurable PV panel architecture integrates every PV cell with three programmable switches to facilitate the PV panel reconfiguration. The additional switches, however, increase the capital cost of the PV system. In this paper, we group a number of PV cells into a PV macro-cell, and the PV panel reconfiguration only changes the connections between adjacent PV macro-cells. The size and internal structure (i.e., the series-parallel connection of PV cells) of all PV macro-cells are the same and will not be changed after PV system installation in the field. Determining the optimal size of the PV macro-cell is the result of a trade-off between the decreased PV system capital cost and enhanced PV system performance. A larger PV macro-cell reduces the cost overhead whereas a smaller PV macro-cell achieves better performance. In this paper, we set out to calculate the optimal size of the PV macro-cells such that the maximum system performance can be achieved subject to an overall system cost limitation. This “design” problem is solved using an efficient search algorithm. In addition, we provide for in-field reconfigurability of the PV panel by enabling formation of series-connected groups of parallel-connected macro-cells. We ensure maximum output power for the PV system in response to any incurring partial shading pattern. This “architecture optimization” problem is solved using dynamic programming.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;MOSFET;Microprocessors;Optimization;Power generation;System analysis and design","","","","2","","5","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Enhanced metamodeling techniques for high-dimensional IC design estimation problems","Kahng, Andrew B.; Lin, Bill; Nath, Siddhartha","CSE, University of California at San Diego, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1861","1866","Accurate estimators of key design metrics (power, area, delay, etc.) are increasingly required to achieve IC cost reductions in system-level through physical layout optimizations. At the same time, identifying physical or analytical models of design metrics has become very challenging due to interactions among many parameters that span technology, architecture and implementation. Metamodeling techniques can simplify this problem by deriving surrogate models from samples of actual implementation data. However, the use of metamodeling techniques in IC design estimation is still in its infancy, and practitioners need more systematic understanding. In this work, we study the accuracy of metamodeling techniques across several axes: (1) low- and high-dimensional estimation problems, (2) sampling strategies, (3) sample sizes, and (4) accuracy metrics. To help obtain more general conclusions, we study these axes for three very distinct chip design estimation problems: (1) area and power of networks-on-chip routers, (2) delay and output slew of standard cells under power delivery network noise, and (3) wirelength and buffer area of clock trees. Our results show that (1) adaptive sampling can effectively reduce the sample size required to derive surrogate models by up to 64% (or, increase estimation accuracy by up to 77%) compared with Latin hypercube sampling; (2) for low-dimensional problems, Gaussian process-based models can be 1.5x more accurate than tree-based models, whereas for high-dimensional problems, tree-based models can be up to 6x more accurate than Gaussian process-based models; and (3) a variant of weighted surrogate modeling [7], which we call hybrid surrogate modeling, can improve estimation accuracy by up to 3x. Finally, to aid architects, design teams, and CAD developers in selection of the appropriate metamodeling techniques, we propose guidelines based on the insights gained from our studies.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513817","","Accuracy;Estimation error;Integrated circuit modeling;Mars;Metamodeling;Solid modeling","","","","0","","30","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a formal methodology for designing NML circuits that marshals the design parameters to generate a layout that is guaranteed to evolve correctly in time at 0K. The approach is further augmented to identify functional design targets when considering thermal noise associated with higher temperatures.

Before wafer thinning, TSVs are buried in silicon and cannot be mechanically contacted, which severely limits test access. Although TSVs become exposed after wafer thinning, probing on them is difficult because of TSV dimensions and the risk of probe-induced damage. To circumvent these problems, we propose a non-invasive method for pre-bond TSV test that does not require TSV probing. We use open TSVs as capacitive loads of their driving gates and measure the propagation delay by means of ring oscillators. Defects in TSVs cause variations in their RC parameters and therefore lead to variations in the propagation delay. By measuring these variations, we can detect resistive open and leakage faults. We exploit different voltage levels to increase the sensitivity of the test and its robustness against random process variations. Results on fault detection effectiveness are presented through HSPICE simulations using realistic models for 45nm CMOS technology. The estimated DfT area cost of our method is negligible for realistic dies.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513671","","Circuit faults;Propagation delay;Radiation detectors;Ring oscillators;Testing;Through-silicon vias","","","","8","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, faulty-free behavior of the voltage regulator is crucial for ensuring data retention in core-cells when the SRAM is in low-power mode. This paper investigates the root cause of data retention faults due to voltage regulator malfunctions.

A mixed scan architecture is proposed which involves flip-flops with shadow scan design at the end of timing-critical paths and flip-flops with standard scan at non-critical locations. In order to preserve system controllability during test, system flip-flops with shadow scan can be set in scan mode and selectively reset before switching to capture mode.

These phenomena lead to increasing device delays during the operational lifetime, which results in increasing pipeline stage delays. However, the aging rates of different stages are different. Hence, a previously delay-balanced pipeline becomes increasingly imbalanced resulting in a non-optimized design in terms of Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), frequency, area and power consumption. In this paper, we propose an MTTF-balanced pipeline design, in which the pipeline stage delays are balanced after the desired lifetime rather than at design time. This can lead to significant MTTF (lifetime) improvements as well as additional performance, area, and power benefits.

As a consequence for gate delay testing, a single test vector pair is no longer sufficient to provide the required low test escape probabilities for a single delay fault. Recently proposed statistical test generation methods are therefore guided by a metric, which defines the probability of detecting a delay fault with a given test set. However, since runtime and accuracy are dominated by the large number of required metric evaluations, more efficient approximation methods are mandatory for any practical application. In this work, a new statistical dynamic timing analysis algorithm is introduced to tackle this problem. The associated approximation error is very small and predominantly caused by the impact of delay variations on path sensitization and hazards.

The two main requirements of control applications are: (1) robustness and, in particular, stability and (2) high control quality. Although it is essential to guarantee stability and provide a certain degree of robustness even in the worst-case scenario, a design procedure which merely takes the worst-case scenario into consideration can lead to a poor expected (average-case) control quality, since the design is solely tuned to a scenario that occurs very rarely. On the other hand, considering only the expected quality of control does not necessarily provide robustness and stability in the worst-case. Therefore, both the robustness and the expected control quality should be taken into account in the design process.

Effective defect screening for such chips requires advanced test techniques that target defects in the embedded cores and the power management structures. We describe recent advances in test generation and test scheduling techniques for SoCs that support power switches, voltage islands, and dynamic voltage scaling schemes.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513604","Dynamic power;SoC test scheduling;dynamic voltage scaling;power switches;static power","Built-in self-test;Radiation detectors;System-on-chip;Transistors;Voltage control;Voltage-controlled oscillators","","","","1","","36","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

State-of-the-art automotive architectures are highly heterogeneous and complex systems that rely on distributed functions based on electronics and software. As cars are getting more connected with their environment, the vulnerability to attacks is rapidly growing. Examples for such wireless communication are keyless entry systems, WiFi, or Bluetooth. Despite this increasing vulnerability, the design of automotive architectures is still mainly driven by safety and cost issues rather than security. In this paper, we present potential threats and vulnerabilities, and outline upcoming security challenges in automotive architectures. In particular, we discuss the challenges arising in electric vehicles, like the vulnerability to attacks involving tampering with the battery safety. Finally, we discuss future automotive architectures based on Ethernet/IP and how formal verification methods might be used to increase their security.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513548","","Automotive engineering;Batteries;Computer architecture;Plugs;Security;Vehicles;Wireless communication","","","","3","","33","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since automotive systems design is highly cost driven, an important goal is to maximize the number of control applications to be packed onto a single processor or electronic control unit (ECU). Current design methods start with a controller design step, where the sampling period and controller gain values are decided based on given control performance objectives. However, operating systems (OS) on the ECU (e.g., ERCOSek) are usually pre-configured and offer only a limited set of sampling periods. Hence, a controller is implemented using an available sampling period, which is the shorter period closest to the one determined in the controller design step. However, this increases the load on the ECU (i.e., the processor runs the controller more often than what is actually required by design). This reduces the number of applications that can be mapped, and increases costs of the system. To overcome this predicament, we propose a multirate controller, which switches between multiple available sampling periods offered by the OS on the ECU. Apart from meeting all control objectives, this avoids the unnecessary ECU overload resulting from always sampling at a constant, higher rate.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513681","","Automotive engineering;Closed loop systems;Poles and zeros;Process control;Schedules;Switches","","","","0","","7","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way for the semiconductor (SC) industry to fight against counterfeiting of electronic parts is to add technological innovation at the component level itself. The target is to enable the product authentication in a fast and reliable way. Because semiconductor manufacturing is a complex and delicate operation producing highly complex products which are sensitive to many environmental factors, any introduction of changes in its production - which the implementation of anti-counterfeiting (A/C) technologies must also comply to - must undergo thorough testing and qualification steps. This is mandatory to control the compliancy to the strict delivery requirements, quality and reliability level the industry has established, in line with the product performance specifications. This paper aims to explain the comprehensive requirements specification developed by members of semiconductor and related industries in Europe, to add authentication technologies solutions into IC packages. It also describes the qualification processes and testing plans to implement the most adequate and effective anti-counterfeiting technology (A/T). One of the main challenges in this A/C task is to make sure that the added A/C feature in electronic components does not create any additional reliability or failure issue, nor introduce additional risks that will benefit counterfeiters.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513683","Anti-counterfeiting technologies;authentication;component counterfeiting;failure analysis;failure prevention;re-packaging;reliability testing;remarking","Authentication;Counterfeiting;Industries;Packaging;Production;Reliability;Testing","","","","2","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key technique of the proposed method is a novel layout-aware heuristic path selection algorithm which takes the spatial correlation and linear dependence between paths into consideration.

Detailed analysis on the performance/reliability degradation caused by dual-port accesses and the corresponding design optimization are performed.

For a case study architecture, hot-swapping support could be added with only 29% area overhead. In this paper we focus on experimental evaluation of the hot-swapping system from a fabricated chip in 65nm CMOS process. Autonomous testing of the hot-swapping system is enhanced with back-bias circuitry to attain an early fault detection and restoration system. Experimental measurements prove that the proposed concept works well, predicting fault occurrence with a configurable prediction interval, while power measurements reveal that with only 20% power overhead the proposed system can attain reliability levels similar to triple modular redundancy. Additionally, measurements reveal that manufacturing randomness across the die can significantly influence identical sub-circuit reliability located in different parts in the die, although identical layout has been employed.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513566","","Arrays;Circuit faults;Random access memory;Reliability;Switches;Testing;Tunneling magnetoresistance","","","","1","","9","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a novel approach which enables spatial correlation modeling of wafer-level analog/RF tests to handle such effects and, thereby, to drastically reduce prediction error for measurements exhibiting discontinuous spatial patterns. The core of the proposed approach is a k-means algorithm which partitions a wafer into k clusters, as caused by discontinuous effects. Individual correlation models are then constructed within each cluster, revoking the assumption that spatial patterns should be smooth and continuous across the entire wafer. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on industrial probe test data from more than 3,400 wafers, revealing significant error reduction over existing approaches.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513569","","Correlation;Data models;Measurement uncertainty;Predictive models;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device modeling;Training","","","","3","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A great deal of research has been devoted to deriving the analytic model for the bounds on the design parameter of a single resource as well as its optimization. The optimization for multiple periodic resources, however, requires a holistic approach due to the conflicting requirements of the limited computational capacity of a system among resources. Thus, this paper addresses a holistic optimization of multiple periodic resources with regard to minimum system utilization. We extend the existing analysis of a single resource in order for the variable interferences among resources to be captured in the resource bound, and then solve the problem with Geometric Programming (GP).

A sophisticated TSV stress-aware floorplan policy is proposed to minimize the possibility of wafer cracking and interfacial delamination. In addition, the run-time thermal management scheme effectively eliminates large thermal gradients between layers.

However, the applicability of PTA has been limited because of its dependence on relatively exotic hardware: fully-associative caches using random replacement.

Most existing research works on fault-tolerance have focused on transient and permanent faults of cores. Intermittent faults are a separate class of defects resulting from on-chip temperature, pressure and voltage variations and lasting for a few cycles to several seconds or more. Operations of cores impacted by intermittent faults are suspended during these cycles but come back alive when conditions become favorable. This paper proposes a technique to model the availability of multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) with intermittent and reparable device defects. This model is based on Markov chain with stochastic fault distribution and can be applied even for permanent faults. Based on this model, a design space pruning technique is proposed to select a set of task mappings (with variable resource usage), which minimizes the task communication energy while satisfying the MPSoC availability constraint. Moreover, task migration overhead is also minimized, which is an important consideration for frequently occurring intermittent and temperature related faults, where prolonged system downtime during task re-mapping is not desired. Experiments conducted with real-life and synthetic application task graphs demonstrate that the proposed technique minimizes communication energy by 30% and reduces migration overhead by 50% as compared to the existing approaches.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513777","","Availability;Fault tolerance;Maintenance engineering;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Optimization;Steady-state","","","","2","","18","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such process, often called Trojan detection, is challenging since the specifics of hardware Trojans inserted by intelligent adversaries are difficult to predict and most Trojans do not affect the logic behavior of the circuit unless they are activated. Also, Trojan detection via parametric measurements becomes increasingly difficult with increasing levels of process variations. In this paper we propose a method that maximizes the resolution of each path delay measurement, in terms of its ability to detect the targeted Trojan. In particular, for each Trojan, our approach accentuates the Trojan's impact by generating a vector that sensitizes the shortest path passing via the Trojan's site. We estimate the minimum number of chips to which each vector must be applied to detect the Trojan with sufficient confidence for a given level of process variations. Finally, we demonstrate the significant improvements in effectiveness and cost provided by our approach under high levels of process variations. Experimental results on several benchmark circuits show that we can achieve dramatic reduction in test cost using our approach compared to classical path delay testing.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513708","Hardware Trojan;parametric test;security","Clocks;Delays;Integrated circuit modeling;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing;Trojan horses;Vectors","","","","5","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, systematic approaches to post-silicon validation are essential. Our research indicates that many of the bottlenecks of existing post-silicon validation approaches are direct consequences of very long error detection latencies. Error detection latency is the time elapsed between the activation of a bug during post-silicon validation and its detection or manifestation as a system failure. In our earlier papers, we created the Quick Error Detection (QED) technique to overcome this significant challenge. QED systematically creates a wide variety of post-silicon validation tests to detect bugs in processor cores and uncore components of multi-core System-on-Chips (SoCs) very quickly, i.e., with very short error detection latencies. In this paper, we present an overview of QED and summarize key results: 1. Error detection latencies of “typical” post-silicon validation tests can range up to billions of clock cycles. 2.

The fundamental idea is to simulate a design with multiple cores by creating an emulation kernel in software on top of a single physical instance of the core. The emulation kernel switches between tasks mapped to different cores and manages the logical simulation times of the individual cores. As a result, we can achieve fast and cycle-accurate simulation of symmetric multicore designs, thereby overcoming the accuracy concerns of virtual prototyping and the scalability issues of physical prototyping. Our experiments with industrial multicore designs show that the simulation time with hybrid prototyping grows only linearly with the number of cores and the inter-core communication traffic, while providing 100% cycle accuracy.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513776","Embedded systems;FPGA prototyping;Multicore design;Validation;Virtual prototyping","Context;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Multicore processing;Prototypes;Transform coding","","","","1","","11","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By doing so, RCDR avoids multiple search window retransmissions leading to reduced number of external memory accesses, thus memory energy reduction. To deal with out-of-order processing and further reduce external memory traffic, a statistics-based partial results compressor is developed. The on-chip video memory energy is reduced by employing a statistical power gating scheme and candidate blocks reordering. Experimental results show that our reference-centered memory hierarchy outperforms the state-of-the-art [7][13] by providing reduction of up to 71% for external memory energy, 88% on-chip memory static energy, and 65% on-chip memory dynamic energy.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513590","3D-Video;Application-Aware DPM;Disparity Estimation;Energy Efficiency;Low-Power Design;MVC;Memory Hierarchy;Motion Estimation;Multiview Video Coding;On-Chip Video Memory","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Memory management;Streaming media;System-on-chip;Vectors","","","","5","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve these goals we overturn the traditional concepts of redundancy, and present a novel design flow for yield enhancement called “Reduced Redundancy Insertion”, where spares can potentially have less area and performance than their fathers. We develop a model for the revenue associated with the new design methodology that integrates system configuration and leverages yield, area and performance. The primary metric used in this model is termed “Expected Performance per Area”, which is a measure that can be reliably estimated for different system architectures, and can be maximized by using algorithms proposed in this paper.

The heavy use of compiled memories poses multiple challenges on the characterization, validation, and reliability fronts. This motivates solutions that can reduce overall cost, time, and risk to certify memories through the identification of a reduced set of ‘fundamental’ memory macros that can be used one or more times to realize all memory instances in the design. This paper describes MemPack, a fast, general method based upon the classical change-making algorithm for the identification of such fundamental memory macros. By relaxing the need for exact realization of memories and tolerating wastage within the context of change-making, MemPack enables tradeoffs between memory capacity and reduction in the number of fundamental macros. It also controls multiplexing and instantiation costs, minimizing the impact on critical path delay and address line loading. Results on industrial and synthetic benchmarks for three different optimization objectives (performance, balance, and minimization) show that MemPack is effective in identifying fundamental sets that are as much as 16× smaller than the original set for 0.8–4.7% wasted bits.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513749","","Algorithm design and analysis;Industries;Memory management;Minimization;Multiplexing;Reliability;System-on-chip","","","","0","","6","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Customized coprocessor synthesis exploits design space exploration to derive Pareto optimal design configurations for a set of targeted metrics. Existing exploration strategies for coprocessor synthesis have been focused on either time consuming iterative scheduling approaches or ad-hoc sampling of the solution space guided by the designer's experience. In this paper, we introduce a meta-model assisted exploration framework that eliminates the aforementioned drawbacks by using response surface models (RSMs) for generating customized coprocessor architectures. The methodology is based on the construction of analytical delay and area models for predicting the quality of the design points without resorting to costly architectural synthesis procedures. Various RSM techniques are evaluated with respect to their accuracy and convergence. We show that the targeted solution space can be accurately modeled through RSMs, thus enabling a speedup of the overall exploration runtime without compromising the quality of results. Comparative experimental results, over a set of real-life benchmarks, prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quality improvements of the design solutions and exploration runtime reductions.

These trends necessitate efficient methods to handle late-stage engineering change orders (ECOs) to the functional specification, often in response to errors discovered after much of the implementation is finished. Past ECO synthesis algorithms have typically treated ECOs as functional errors and applied error diagnosis techniques to solve them. However, error diagnosis methods are primarily geared towards finding a single change, and moreover, tend to be computationally complex. In this paper, we propose a unique methodology that can systematically incorporate human intuition into the ECO process. Our methodology involves finding a set of directly substitutable points known as functional correspondences between the original implementation and the new specification by using name-preserving synthesis and user hints, to diminish the size of the ECO problem. On average, our approach can reduce the size of logic changes by 94% from those reported in current literature. We then incorporate our logic ECO changes into an incremental physical synthesis flow to demonstrate its usability in an industrial setting. Our ECO synthesis methodology is evaluated on high-performance industrial designs. Results indicate that post-ECO worst negative slack (WNS) improved 14% and total negative slack (TNS) improved 46% over pre-ECO.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513655","Engineering Change Order;Logic Synthesis;Physical Synthesis","Algorithm design and analysis;Error correction;Logic gates;Optimization;Runtime;Solid modeling;Timing","","","","0","","29","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has focused on automated trace signal selection problem in order to maximize restoration of the untraced state elements using the few traced signals.

In this paper, we present new accurate methods for Trojan detection that are based upon post-silicon multimodal thermal and power characterization techniques. Our approach first estimates the detailed post-silicon spatial power consumption using thermal maps of the IC, then applies 2DPCA to extract features of the spatial power consumption, and finally uses statistical tests against the features of authentic ICs to detect the Trojan. To characterize real-world ICs accurately, we perform our experiments in presence of 20% – 40% CMOS process variation. Our results reveal that our new methodology can detect Trojans with 3–4 orders of magnitude smaller power consumptions than the total power usage of the chip, while it scales very well because of the spatial view to the ICs internals by the thermal mapping.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513709","","Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Power demand;Trojan horses;Vectors","","","","8","","14","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accelerate architectural simulation, prior researchers have proposed representative sampling simulation to trade small loss of accuracy for notable speed improvement. Generally, they use fine-grained phase analysis to select only a small representative portion of program execution intervals for detailed cycle-accurate simulation, while functionally simulating the remaining portion. However, though phase granularity is one of the most important factors to simulation speed, it has not been well investigated and most prior researches explore a fine-grained scheme. This limits their effectiveness in further improving simulation speed with the requirement of increasingly complex architectural designs and new lengthy benchmarks. In this paper, by analyzing the impact of phase granularity on simulation speed, we observe that coarse-grained phases can better capture the overall program characteristics with a less number of phases and the last representative phase could be classified in a very early program position, leading to fewer execution internals being functionally simulated. By contrast, fine-grained phases usually have much shorter execution intervals and thus the overall detailed simulation time could be reduced. Based on the above observation, we design a multi-level sampling simulation technique that combines both fine-grained and coarse-grained phase analysis for sampling simulation. Such a scheme uses fine-grained simulation points to represent only the selected coarse-grained simulation points instead of the entire program execution, thus it could further reduce both the functional and detailed simulation time. Experimental results using SPEC2000 show such a framework is effective: using the SimPoint method as baseline, it can reduce about 90% functional simulation time and about 50% detailed simulation time. It finally achieves a geometric a- erage speedup of 14.04X over SimPoint with comparable accuracy.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513587","","Accuracy;Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Measurement;Principal component analysis;Sampling methods;Vectors","","","","0","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reliability can be regained through redundancy, error checking with recovery, voltage scaling and other means, but these techniques impose area/energy costs. Since some applications (e.g. media) can tolerate limited computation errors and still provide useful results, error-tolerant computation models have been explored, with both the application and computation fabric having stochastic characteristics. Stochastic computation has, however, largely focused on application-specific hardware solutions, and is not general enough to handle arbitrary bit errors that impact memory addressing or control in processors. In response, this paper addresses requirements for error-tolerant execution by proposing and evaluating techniques for running error-tolerant software on a general-purpose processor built from an unreliable fabric. We study the minimum error-protection required, from a microarchitecture perspective, to still produce useful results at the application output. Even with random errors as frequent as every 250µs, our proposed design allows JPEG and MP3 benchmarks to sustain good output quality—14dB and 7dB respectively.

The minimum service requirement of a low-criticality task is ensured by its largest period. However, at runtime low-criticality tasks can be released early by exploiting the slack time generated from the over-provisioned execution time for high-criticality tasks to reduce their service intervals and thus improve their service levels. We propose an Early-Release EDF (ER-EDF) scheduling algorithm, which can judiciously manage the early release of low-criticality tasks without affecting the timeliness of high-criticality tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art EDF-VD scheduling algorithm, our simulation results show that the ER-EDF can successfully schedule much more task sets. Moreover, the achieved execution frequencies of low-criticality tasks can also be significantly improved under ER-EDF.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513489","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Ear;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Schedules;Scheduling","","","","6","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is conventionally assumed that the dark silicon will be provisioned with heterogeneous resources, for example dedicated hardware accelerators. In this paper we challenge the conventional assumption and build a case for homogeneous dark silicon CMPs that exploit the inherent variations in process parameters that exist in scaled technologies to offer increased performance. Since process variations result in core-to-core variations in power and frequency, the idea is to cherry pick the best subset of cores for an application so as to maximize performance within the power budget. To this end, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for optimal core selection, thread mapping and frequency assignment for a large class of multi-threaded applications.

The process variations cause large fluctuations in the access times of SRAM cells. Caches made of those SRAM cells cannot be accessed within the target clock cycle time, which reduces yield of processors. To combat these access time failures in caches, many schemes have been proposed, which are, however, limited in their coverage and do not scale well at high failure rates. We propose a new L1 cache architecture (AVICA) employing asymmetric pipelining and pseudo multi-banking. Asymmetric pipelining eliminates all access time failures in L1 caches. Pseudo multi-banking minimizes the performance impact of asymmetric pipelining. For further performance improvement, architectural techniques are proposed. Our experimental results show that our proposed L1 cache architecture incurs less than 1% performance hit compared to the conventional cache architecture with no access time failure.

The presented approach checks for error in a value stored in an array before it is overwritten rather than, as currently done, when it is read (check-on-read). This aims at reducing the number and energy of error code checks. This lazy protection approach can be used for caches in systems that support failure-atomicity to recover from corrupted state due to a fault. The paper proposes and evaluates an adaptive memory protection scheme that is capable of both check-on-read and check-on-write and switches between the two protection modes depending on the energy to be saved and fault coverage requirements. Experimental analysis shows that our technique reduces the average dynamic energy of the L1 instruction cache tag and data arrays by 18.6% and 17.7% respectively. For the L1 data cache, this is 17.2% and 2.9%, and the savings are 13.4% for the L2 tag array.

In spite of utilizing more than one predictor, none or only one additional cycle is enough for producing the correct result in the majority of the cases. In this paper we present multispeculation as a way of increasing the performance of tree structures with a negligible area penalty. By judiciously introducing these structures into computation trees, it will only be necessary to predict in certain selected nodes, thus minimizing the number of operations that can potentially mispredict. Hence, the average latency will be diminished and thus performance will be increased.

With resource sharing, only operations scheduled in separate cycles can be assigned to shared hardware, which can result in longer schedules. In this paper, we propose a new approach to resource sharing that allows multiple operations to be performed by a single functional unit in one clock cycle. Our approach is based on multi-pumping, which operates functional units at a higher frequency than the surrounding system logic, typically 2×, allowing multiple computations to complete in a single system cycle. Our approach is particularly effective for DSP blocks on an FPGA, which are used to perform multiply and/or accumulate operations. Our results show that resource sharing using multi-pumping is comparable to traditional resource sharing in terms of area saved, but provides significant performance advantages. Specifically, when targeting a 50% reduction in DSP blocks, traditional resource sharing decreases circuit speed performance by 80%, on average, whereas multi-pumping decreases circuit speed by just 5%. Multi-pumping is a viable approach to achieve the area reductions of resource sharing, with considerably less negative impact to circuit performance.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513499","","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Pipelines;Registers;Resource management","","","","3","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A virtual prototyping platform for real-time systems with a case study for a two-wheeled robot","Mueller-Gritschneder, Daniel; Lu, Kun; Wallander, Erik; Greim, Marc; Schlichtmann, Ulf","Institute for Electronic Design Automation, TU Muenchen, Germany","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1331","1334","In today's real-time system design, a virtual prototype can help to increase both the design speed and quality. Developing a virtual prototyping platform requires realistic modeling of the HW system, accurate simulation of the real-time SW, and integration with a reactive real-time environment. Such a VP simulation platform is often difficult to develop. In this paper, we propose a case-study of autonomous two-wheeled robot to show how to develop a virtual prototyping platform rapidly in SystemC/TLM to adequately aid in the design of this instable system with hard real-time constraints. Our approach is an integration of four major model components. Firstly, an accurate physical model of the robot is provided. Secondly, a virtual world is modeled in Java that offers a 3D environment for the robot to move in. Thirdly, the embedded control SW is developed. Finally, the overall HW system is modeled in SystemC at transaction level. This HW model wraps the physical model, interacts with the virtual world, and simulates the real-time SW by integrating an Instruction Set Simulator of the embedded CPU. By integrating these components into a platform, designers can efficiently optimize the embedded SW architecture, explore the design space and check real-time conditions for different system parameters such as buffer sizes, CPU frequency or cache configurations.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513720","Embedded Systems;Real-time Constraints;Transaction Level Modeling;Virtual Prototyping","Cameras;Embedded systems;Java;Mathematical model;Real-time systems;Robot vision systems","","","","1","","10","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the high energy and latency of write operations in these memories is a major challenge. In this work, we explore a new approach - shift based write - that offers a fast and energy-efficient alternative to performing writes in spin-based memories. We propose DWM-TAPESTRI, a new all-spin cache design that utilizes Domain Wall Memory (DWM) with shift based writes at all levels of the cache hierarchy. The proposed write scheme enables DWM to be used, for the first time, in L1 caches and in tag arrays, where the inefficiency of writes in spin memories has traditionally precluded their use. At the circuit level, we propose bit-cell designs utilizing shift-based writes, which are tailored to the differing requirements of different levels in the cache hierarchy. We also propose pre-shifting as an architectural technique to hide the latency of shift operations that is inherent to DWM. We performed a systematic device-circuit-architecture evaluation of the proposed design. Over a wide range of SPEC 2006 benchmarks, DWM-TAPESTRI achieves 8.2X improvement in energy and 4X improvement in area, with virtually identical performance, compared to an iso-capacity SRAM cache. Compared to an iso-capacity STT-MRAM cache, the proposed design achieves around 1.6X improvement in both area and energy under iso-performance conditions.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513811","","Arrays;Magnetic domains;Magnetic tunneling;Random access memory;Transistors;Wires","","","","4","","22","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In split manufacturing, a design house (with a low-end, in-house, trusted foundry) fabricates the Front End Of Line (FEOL) layers (transistors and lower metal layers) in advanced technology nodes at an untrusted high-end foundry. The Back End Of Line (BEOL) layers (higher metal layers) are then fabricated at the design house's trusted low-end foundry. Split manufacturing is considered secure (prevents reverse engineering and IC piracy) as it hides the BEOL connections from an attacker in the FEOL foundry. We show that an attacker in the FEOL foundry can exploit the heuristics used in typical floorplanning, placement, and routing tools to bypass the security afforded by straightforward split manufacturing. We developed an attack where an attacker in the FEOL foundry can connect 96% of the missing BEOL connections correctly. To overcome this security vulnerability in split manufacturing, we developed a fault analysis-based defense. This defense improves the security of split manufacturing by deceiving the FEOL attacker into making wrong connections.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513707","","Circuit faults;Foundries;Hamming distance;Integrated circuits;Manufacturing;Metals;Pins","","","","9","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, we present inductive approaches to quantify the exact overhead for 8C, 6C and 4C crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs) for a 3×n mesh arrangement of TSVs. These overheads for different CACs for a 3×n mesh arrangement of TSVs are used to calculate the lower bounds on the corresponding overheads for an n×n mesh arrangements of TSVs. We also discuss an efficient way to implement the coding and decoding (CODEC) circuitry for limiting the maximum crosstalk to 6C.

However, these techniques have limitations due to one of the following reasons: first, they are not suitable for high-performance processor designs due to the power and design overhead they impose; second, they are not accurate enough to effectively exploit the timing margins, requiring substantial safety margin to guarantee correct operation of the processor. In this paper, we introduce an alternative, more effective technique that is suitable for high-performance processor designs, in which a processor predicts timing errors in the critical paths and undertakes preventive steps in order to avoid the errors in the event that the timing margins fall below a critical level. This technique allows a processor to exploit timing margins, while only requiring the minimum safety margin.

In this paper we present a novel parameterized architecture for multi-standard Turbo decoding which illustrates how flexibility, architecture efficiency, and rapid design time can be combined. The proposed architecture supports both single-binary Turbo codes (SBTC) of 3GPP-LTE and double-binary Turbo codes (DBTC) of WiMAX and DVB-RCS standards. It achieves, in both modes, a high architecture efficiency of 4.37 bits/cycle/iteration/mm<sup>2</sup>.

This variation in electrical power availability is represented in its dynamically changing price that can be used to drive workload deferral against performance requirements. But such deferral may cause user dissatisfaction. In this paper, we quantify the impact of deferral on user satisfaction and utilize flexibility from the service level agreements (SLAs) for deferral to adapt with dynamic price variation. We differentiate among the jobs based on their requirements for responsiveness and schedule them for energy saving while meeting deadlines and user satisfaction. Representing utility as decaying functions along with workload deferral, we make a balance between loss of user satisfaction and energy efficiency. We model delay as decaying functions and guarantee that no job violates the maximum deadline, and we minimize the overall energy cost. Our simulation on MapReduce traces show that energy consumption can be reduced by ∼15%, with such utility-aware deferred load balancing. We also found that considering utility as a decaying function gives better cost reduction than load balancing with a fixed deadline.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513512","","Delays;Electricity;Heuristic algorithms;Load management;Load modeling;Prediction algorithms;Servers","","","","0","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering SoCs with hundred of cores in a near future, features as scalability, reachability, and fault assumptions should be considered in the fault-tolerant routing methods. However, the current proposals some have some limitations: (1) increasing cost related to the NoC size, compromising scalability; (2) some healthy routers may not be reached even if there is a source-target path; (3) some algorithms restricts the number of faults and their location to operate correctly. The present work presents a method, inspired in VLSI routing algorithms, to search the path between source-target pairs where the network topology is abstracted. Results present the routing path for different topologies (mesh, torus, Spidergon and Hierarchical-Spidergon) in the presence of faulty routers. The silicon area overhead and total execution time of the path computation is small, demonstrating that the proposed method may be adopted in NoC designs.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513770","","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Network topology;Ports (Computers);Routing;System recovery;Topology","","","","5","","15","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time.

A source-level model is generated by annotating timing information into application source code and allows for very fast software simulation. Accurate cache simulation is a key issue in multicore systems design because the memory subsystem accounts for a large portion of system performance. However, cache simulation at source level faces two major problems: (1) as target data addresses cannot be statically resolved during source code instrumentation, accurate data cache simulation is very difficult at source level, and (2) cache simulation brings large overhead in simulation performance and therefore cancels the gain of source level simulation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for accurate data cache simulation at source level. In addition, we also propose a cache modeling method to accelerate both instruction and data cache simulation. Our experiments show that simulation with the fast cache model achieves 450.7 MIPS (million simulated instructions per second) on a standard x86 laptop, 2.3x speedup compared with a standard cache model. The source-level models with cache simulation achieve accuracy comparable to an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS).

Firm real-time applications in such platforms impose strict requirements on shared memory bandwidth and latency, which must be guaranteed at design-time to reduce verification effort. However, there is currently no real-time memory controller for multichannel memories, and there is no methodology to optimally configure multi-channel memories in real-time systems. This paper has four key contributions: (1) A real-time multi-channel memory controller architecture with a new programmable Multi-Channel Interleaver unit. (2) A novel method for logical-to-physical address translation that enables inter-leaving memory requests across multiple memory channels at different granularities.

Due to Joule heating effect and the temperature dependence of resistivity, temperature is one of the most important factors that affect IR drop and must be taken into account in power grid analysis. However, the sheer size of modern power delivery networks (comprising several thousands or millions of nodes) usually forces designers to neglect thermal effects during IR drop analysis in order to simplify and accelerate simulation. As a result, the absence of accurate estimates of Joule heating effect on IR drop analysis introduces significant uncertainty in the evaluation of circuit functionality. This work presents a new approach for fast electrical-thermal co-simulation of large-scale power grids found in contemporary nanometer-scale ICs. A state-of-the-art iterative method is combined with an efficient and extremely parallel preconditioning mechanism, which enables harnessing the computational resources of massively parallel architectures, such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

One of the major disadvantages for STT-RAM is the latency and energy overhead associated with the write operations. In particular, a long-latency write operation to STT-RAM cache may obstruct other cache accesses and result in severe performance degradation. Consequently, mitigation techniques to minimize the write overhead are required in order to successfully adopt this new technology for cache design. In this paper, we propose an obstruction-aware cache management policy called OAP. OAP monitors the cache to periodically detect LLC-obstruction processes, and manage the cache accesses from different processes.

For next generation in-vehicle networking, the automotive industry identified Ethernet as a promising candidate besides CAN and FlexRay. Ethernet is an IEEE standard and is broadly used in consumer and industry domains. It will bring a number of changes for the design and management of in-vehicle networks and provides significant re-use of components, software, and tools. Ethernet is intended to connect inside the vehicle high-speed communication requiring sub-systems like Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS), navigation and positioning, multimedia, and connectivity systems. For hybrid (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs), Ethernet will be a powerful part of the communication architecture layer that enables the link between the vehicle electronics and the Internet where the vehicle is a part of a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application. Using Ethernet for vehicle connectivity will effectively manage the huge amount of data to be transferred between the outside world and the vehicle through vehicle-to-x (V2V and V2I or V2I+I) communication systems and cloud-based services for advanced energy management solutions. Ethernet is an enabling technology for introducing advanced features into the automotive domain and needs further optimizations in terms of scalability, cost, power, and electrical robustness in order to be adopted and widely used by the industry.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513795","EV communication architecture;Ethernet;automotive;domain based commuication;electric vehicle;in-vehicle networking;smart grid;vehicle network topology","Automotive engineering;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Internet;Protocols;Standards;Vehicles","","","","2","","7","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Impact of adaptive voltage scaling on aging-aware signoff","Chan, Tuck-Boon; Chan, Wei-Ting Jonas; Kahng, Andrew B.","ECE Departments, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1683","1688","Transistor aging due to bias temperature instability (BTI) is a major reliability concern in sub-32nm technology. Aging decreases performance of digital circuits over the entire IC lifetime. To compensate for aging, designs now typically apply adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) to mitigate performance degradation by elevating supply voltage. Varying the supply voltage of a circuit using AVS also causes the BTI degradation to vary over lifetime. This presents a new challenge for margin reduction in conventional signoff methodology, which characterizes timing libraries based on transistor models with pre-calculated BTI degradations for a given IC lifetime. Many works have separately addressed predictive models of BTI and the analysis of AVS, but there is no published work that considers BTI-aware signoff that accounts for the use of AVS during IC lifetime. This motivates us to study how the presence of AVS should affect aging-aware signoff. In this paper, we first simulate and analyze circuit performance degradation due to BTI in the presence of AVS. Based on our observations, we propose a rule-of-thumb for chip designers to characterize an aging-derated standard-cell timing library that accounts for the impact of AVS. According to our experimental results, this aging-aware signoff approach avoids both overestimation and underestimation of aging - either of which results in power or area penalty - in AVS enabled systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513786","","Aging;Degradation;Integrated circuit modeling;Libraries;Logic gates;Timing;Transistors","","","","4","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, given that their latency is only 50% lower than that of main memory, DRAM caches considerably increase latency for misses. They also incur a significant energy overhead for remote lookups in snoop-based multi-socket systems. Ideally, it would be possible to detect in advance that a request will miss in the DRAM cache and thus selectively bypass it. This work proposes a “dual grain filter” which successfully predicts whether an access is a hit or a miss in most cases. Experimental results with commercial and scientific workloads show that a 158KB dual-grain filter can correctly predict data block residency for 85% of all accesses to a 256MB DRAM cache. As a result, average off-die latency with our filter is within 8% of that possible with a perfectly accurate filter, which is impractical to implement.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513478","","Accuracy;Arrays;Oceans;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Servers","","","","1","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To make sure that system invariants are not broken because of bugs in the new controller, an architecture is used in which both controllers are implemented on the platform, and a supervisor process checks that the actions of the new controller keep the system within its safe states. If an invariant may be violated, the supervisor switches over to the old controller that ensures correct behavior, but possibly degraded performance. A key question in the design of such supervisors is the switching strategy: when should the supervisor reinstate the new controller after it has switched to the old one? In general, one would prefer to use the new controller as much as possible, provided it does not violate safety. However, arbitrarily switching back to the new controller can cause the system to become unstable, even when each controller in isolation ensures stability. We provide a supervisor synthesis procedure that uses a simple counting strategy for the supervisor. Our synthesized supervisor ensures that switching between the controllers ensures stability of the system, while maintaining its safety properties and providing a lower bound on the use of the new controller. We prove the correctness of the strategy and show on an example that it can provide close to optimal use of the new controller against many disturbance scenarios.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513678","","Asymptotic stability;Games;Safety;Stability analysis;Switched systems;Switches","","","","1","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show the first published experimental measurement-based characterization of the threshold voltage distribution of flash memory. To accomplish this, we develop a testing infrastructure that uses the read retry feature present in some 2Y-nm (i.e., 20–24nm) flash chips. We devise a model of the threshold voltage distributions taking into account program/erase (P/E) cycle effects, analyze the noise in the distributions, and evaluate the accuracy of our model. A key result is that the threshold voltage distribution can be modeled, with more than 95% accuracy, as a Gaussian distribution with additive white noise, which shifts to the right and widens as P/E cycles increase. The novel characterization and models provided in this paper can enable the design of more effective error tolerance mechanisms for future flash memories.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513712","Memory Reliability;Memory Signal Processing;NAND Flash;Read Retry;Threshold Voltage Distribution","Correlation;Flash memory cells;Kernel;Noise;Threshold voltage;Vectors","","","","12","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a largely unexplored design point for asynchronous NoCs, relying on transition-signaling bundled data, which contributes to break the above barriers. Compared to an existing lightweight synchronous switch architecture, xpipesLite, the post-layout asynchronous switch achieved a 71% reduction in area, up to 85% reduction in overall power consumption, and a 44% average reduction in energy-per-flit, while mastering the more stringent timing assumptions of this solution with a semi-automated synthesis flow.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513525","","Clocks;Mice;Robustness;Switches","","","","6","","24","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Depending on the field of application, standard topologies like meshes, fat-trees, and tori might be suboptimal in terms of power consumption, latency and area. This calls for a custom topology design methodology, which is based on the requirements imposed by the application, function and the use-cases of the SoC in question. This work proposes a fast approach, which uses spectral clustering and cluster ensembles to partition the system using normalized cuts and insert the necessary routers.

Most existing mesh-based NoC designs operate the mesh at the same or lower clock speed as the processing elements (PEs). Recently, a new source synchronous ring-based NoC architecture has been proposed, which runs significantly faster than the PEs and offers a significantly higher bandwidth and lower communication latency. The authors implement the NoC topology as a mesh of rings, which occupies the same area as that of a mesh. In this work, we evaluate two alternate source synchronous ring-based NoC topologies called the ring of stars (ROS) and the spine with rings (SWR), which occupy a much lower area, and are able to provide better performance in terms of communication latency compared to a state of the art mesh. In our proposed topologies, the clock and the data NoC are routed in parallel, yielding a fast, synchronous, robust design. Our design allows the PEs to extract a low jitter clock from the high speed ring clock by division. The area and performance of these ring-based NoC topologies is quantified. Experimental results on synthetic traffic show that the new ring-based NoC designs can provide significantly lower latency (upto 4.6×) compared to a state of the art mesh. The proposed floorplan-friendly topologies use fewer buffers (upto 50% less) and lower wire length (upto 64.3% lower) compared to the mesh. Depending on the performance and the area desired, a NoC designer can select among the topologies presented.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513660","","Art;Clocks;Joining processes;Ports (Computers);Synchronization;Topology;Tornadoes","","","","0","","30","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous analysis techniques for FIFO caches are based on the same framework as for LRU caches using qualitative always-hit/always-miss classifications. This approach, though works well for LRU caches, is not suitable to analyze FIFO and usually leads to poor WCET estimation quality. In this paper, we propose a quantitative approach for FIFO cache analysis. Roughly speaking, the proposed quantitative analysis derives an upper bound on the “miss ratio” of an instruction (set), which can better capture the FIFO cache behavior and support more accurate WCET estimations.

They are, however, becoming increasingly power-constrained with the higher on-chip bandwidth requirements of high-performance SoCs. In particular, the physical datapath of a mesh NoC consumes significant energy. Low-swing signaling circuit techniques can substantially reduce the NoC datapath energy, but existing low-swing circuits involve huge area footprints, unreliable signaling or considerable system overheads such as an additional supply voltage, so embedding them into a mesh datapath is not attractive. In this paper, we propose a novel low-swing signaling circuit, a self-resetting logic repeater, to meet these design challenges. The SRLR enables single-ended low-swing pulses to be asynchronously repeated, and hence, consumes less energy than differential, clocked low-swing signaling. To mitigate global process variations while delivering high energy efficiency, three circuit techniques are incorporated. Fabricated in 45nm SOI CMOS, our 10mm SRLR-based low-swing datapath achieves 6.83Gb/s/µm bandwidth density with 40.4fJ/bit/mm energy at 4.1Gb/s data rate at 0.8V.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513778","","Bandwidth;Delays;MOS devices;Robustness;System-on-chip;Threshold voltage;Wires","","","","0","","30","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These mechanisms are controlled by a power-management policy often implemented in the embedded software, with hardware support. Today's circuits have an important static power consumption, whose low-power design require techniques like DVFS or power-gating. A correct and efficient management of these mechanisms is therefore becoming non-trivial. Validating the effect of the power management policy needs to be done very early in the design cycle, as part of the architecture exploration activity. High-level models of the hardware must be annotated with consumption information. Temperature must also be taken into account since leakage current increases exponentially with it. Existing annotation techniques applied to loosely-timed or temporally-decoupled models would create bad simulation artifacts on the temperature profile (e.g. unrealistic peaks). This paper addresses the instrumentation of a timed transaction-level model of the hardware with information on the power consumption of the individual components. It can cope not only with power-state models, but also with Joule-per-bit traffic models, and avoids simulation artifacts when used in a functional/power/temperature co-simulation.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513773","","Computational modeling;Hardware;Instruments;Power demand;Software;Temperature sensors;Time-varying systems","","","","3","","14","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interface is optimized towards low power, fast start-up time and fast conversion time, making it primarily useful in autonomous wireless sensor networks. The interface is time/frequency-based, making it less sensitive to lower supply voltages and other analog non-idealities, whereas conventional amplitude-based interfaces do suffer largely from these non-idealities, especially in smaller CMOS technologies. The sensor-to-digital conversion is based on the locking behavior of a digital PLL, which also includes transient behavior after start-up. Several techniques such as V<inf>DD</inf> scaling, coarse and fine tuning and pulse-width modulated feedback are implemented to decrease the transient and acquisition time and the power to optimize the total energy consumption. In this way the sensor interface consumes only 61µW from a 0.8V DC power supply with a one-sample conversion time of less than 20µs worst-case. The sensor interface is designed and implemented in UMC130 CMOS technology and outputs 8 bit parallel with 7.72 ENOB. Due to its fast start-up time, fast conversion time and low power consumption, it only consumes 5.79 pJ/bit-conversion, which is a state-of-the-art energy efficiency compared to recent resistive sensor interfaces.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513738","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Detectors;Phase noise;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, verifying the hardware compliance with a consistency model is a relevant problem, whose complexity depends on the observability of memory events. Post-silicon checkers analyze a single sequence of events per core and so do most pre-silicon checkers, although one reported method samples two sequences per core. Besides, most are post-mortem checkers requiring the whole sequence of events to be available prior to verification. On the contrary, this paper describes a novel on-the-fly technique for verifying memory consistency from an executable representation of a multicore system. To increase efficiency without hampering verification guarantees, three points are monitored per core. The sampling points are selected to be largely independent from the core's microarchitecture. The technique relies on concurrent relaxed scoreboards to check for consistency violations in each core. To check for global violations, it employs a linear order of events induced by a given test case. We prove that the technique neither indicates false negatives nor false positives when the test case exposes an error that affects the sampled sequences, making it the first on-the-fly checker with full guarantees. We compare our technique with two post-mortem checkers under 2400 scenarios for platforms with 2 to 8 cores. The results show that our technique is at least 100 times faster than a checker sampling a single sequence per processor and it needs approximately 1/4 to 3/4 of the overall verification effort required by a post-mortem checker sampling two sequences per processor.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513584","","Bipartite graph;Complexity theory;Hardware;Memory management;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Observability","","","","1","","12","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the last level cache (considered L2 in this paper) holds most of the state, the volume of data dumped and the transfer time are dominated by the L2 cache. The limited bandwidth to transfer data off-chip coupled with the large size of L2 cache results in stalling the processor for long durations when dumping the cache contents off-chip. To alleviate this, we propose to transfer only those cache lines that were updated since the previous dump. Since maintaining a bit-vector with a separate bit to track the status of individual cache lines is expensive, we propose 2 methods: (i) where a bit tracks multiple cache lines and (ii) an Interval Table which stores only the starting and ending addresses of continuous runs of updated cache lines. Both methods require significantly lesser space compared to a bit-vector, and allow the designer to choose the amount of space to allocate for this design-for-debug (DFD) feature. The impact of reducing storage space is that some non-updated cache lines are dumped too. We attempt to minimize such overheads. Further, the Interval Table is independent of the cache size which makes it ideal for large caches. Through experimentation, we also determine the break-even point below which a t-lines/bit bit-vector is beneficial compared to an Interval Table.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513559","","Aerospace electronics;Debugging;Hardware;Program processors;Proposals;Registers;Vectors","","","","0","","31","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method first creates geometric template according to the original power grid topology and then performs novel iterative grid corrections to improve the accuracy by matching the electrical behaviors of the reduced template grid with the original grid. Our experimental results show that the proposed reduction method can reduce industrial power grid designs by up to 95% with very satisfactory solution quality.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513785","","Damping;Measurement;Power dissipation;Power grids;Resistors;Voltage control;Wires","","","","1","","13","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For aggressive clocking, we select CIs based on statistical static timing analysis (SSTA), which achieves efficient speedup during target lifetime while mitigating degradation of timing yield (i.e., probability of satisfying the timing). Furthermore, we consider process variation and aging on not only CIs but also basic instructions (BIs). Even if basic functional units (BFUs), e.g., ALU, get slower due to aging, only a few BIs with critical propagation delay may violate the timing, whereas the other BIs running on the same BFU can still satisfy the timing. We then introduce “customized BFUs”, which execute only such aging-critical BIs. The customized BFUs, used as spare BFUs of the aging-critical BIs, can extend lifetime of the system. Combining the two approaches enables speedup as well as lifetime extension with no or negligibly small area/power overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our work outperforms conventional worst-case work (by an average speedup of about 49%) and existing SSTA-based work (16x or more lifetime extension with comparable speedup).","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513497","","Aging;Assembly;Clocks;Delays;Logic gates;Transistors","","","","1","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study reference approaches to measure fixed-point errors of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems without feedback. Unsurprisingly, we find the existing analytical approach significantly faster than a straightforward simulation-based estimation.

To enable this scheme, statistical models for quantifying software resilience and error masking properties at function and instruction level are proposed. These models leverage a whole new range of reliability optimization. Given a tolerable performance overhead, our scheme selectively protects the reliability-wise most important instructions based on their masking probability, vulnerability, and redundancy overhead.

How to place physical sensors such that both the number of thermal sensors and the temperature estimation errors are minimized becomes important for on-chip dynamic thermal management of today's high-performance microprocessors. In this paper, we present a new systematic thermal sensor placement algorithm. Different from the traditional thermal sensor placement algorithms where only the temperature information is explored, the new placement method takes advantage of functional unit power information by exploiting the correlation of power estimation errors among functional blocks. The new power-driven placement algorithm applies the correlation clustering algorithm to determine both the locations of sensors and the number of sensors automatically such that the temperature estimation errors can be minimized. Experimental results on a dual-core architecture show that the new thermal sensor placements yield more accurate full-chip temperature estimation compared to the uniform and the k-means based placement approaches.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513698","","Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Estimation error;Runtime;Temperature sensors","","","","0","","20","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the simulation speed may be significantly lowered due to the cache simulation overhead. In this paper, we propose an approach that can reduce much of the cache simulation overhead, while still calculating cache misses precisely. For instruction cache, we statically analyze possible cache conflicts and perform cache conflicts aware annotation for host-compiled simulation. Within loops, the conflicts are dynamically captured by tagging the basic blocks instead of performing the expensive cache simulation. In this way, a vast majority of the cache accesses can be saved from simulation. For data cache, aggregated cache simulation is used for a large data block. Further, the data locality can be bound by considering the data allocation principle of a program. Experiments show that our approach improves the speed of host-compiled simulation by one order of magnitude, while providing the cache miss numbers with high accuracy.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513585","","Analytical models;Data models;Estimation;Mathematical model;Resource management;Software performance;Timing","","","","1","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the biconditional expansion is based on the XOR/XNOR operations, XOR-rich logic circuits are efficiently represented and manipulated with canonical Reduced and Ordered BBDDs (ROBBDDs). Experimental results show that ROBBDDs have 37% fewer nodes on average compared to traditional ROBDDs. To exploit this opportunity in logic synthesis for XOR-rich circuits, we developed a BBDD-based One-Pass Synthesis (OPS) methodology. The BBDD-based OPS is capable to harness the potential of novel XOR-efficient devices, such as ambipolar transistors. Experimental results show that our logic synthesis methodology reduces the number of ambipolar transistors by 49.7% on average with respect to state-of-art commercial logic synthesis tool.

To address this challenge, we developed an optimized partition scheduling algorithm which considers exclusive regions to achieve the synchronization between partitions across cores. We show that the problem of finding the optimal partition schedule is NP-complete and present a Constraint Programming formulation.

This paper discusses these concepts applied to practical, real, baseband subsystems for wireless communications. Configurability allows both scalability of a reference IP subsystem - e.g. to handle varieties of standards and use cases; and differentiation, so that customers get the optimal IP subsystem for their unique needs.

Two seminal papers that appeared in 2002 [1], [2] defined a framework for the use of feedback mechanisms for power and temperature control. In [1], the focus was on power management with the goal being to extend battery life on the AMD Mobile Athlon. This was one of the earliest papers to use DVFS settings as actuators to guarantee a given energy level in the battery at the end of a given time interval. The controller was implemented using a combination of OS files and Linux kernel modules. Almost simultaneously, [2] posed the dynamic thermal management task as a formal control-theoretic problem requiring the thermal modeling of the processor and the use of the established control structures of classical feedback theory. Some of the defining features of [2] include the development of layout-based thermal RC models for the processor; the use of an architecturally-driven control mechanism, namely, the instruction fetching rate; and the use of the SPEC2000 benchmarks to illustrate temperature control action under various workloads. The controller used in [2] is a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) structure whose input is the deviation of the sensed temperature from the target temperature and whose output is the toggle rate of the instruction fetching mechanism.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513820","","Adaptation models;Integrated circuit modeling;Multicore processing;Program processors;Temperature control;Thermal management","","","","0","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Picture-in-Picture (PiP) application is one such application scenario, where two videos are played simultaneously. Although the PiP application is very efficiently handled in televisions and personal computers by providing maximum quality of service to the multiple streams, it is a difficult task in devices with resource constraints. In order to efficiently utilize the resources, it is essential to derive the necessary processor cycles for multiple video streams such that they are displayed with some prespecified quality constraint. Therefore, we propose a network calculus based formal framework to help schedule multiple media streams in the presence of buffer contraints. Further, our framework also presents a schedulability analysis condition to check if the multimedia streams can be scheduled such that a prespecified quality constraint is satisfied with the available service. We present this framework in the context of a PiP application, but it is applicable in general for multiple media streams.

Lagrangian Relaxation is an effective technique to handle complex constrained optimization problems and therefore has been used for gate sizing. In this paper, we propose an improved Lagrangian Relaxation formulation for leakage power minimization that accounts for maximum gate input slew and maximum gate output capacitance in addition to the circuit timing constraints. We also present a fast topological greedy heuristic to solve the Lagrangian Relaxation Subproblem and a complementary procedure to fix the few remaining slew and capacitace violations. The experimental results, generated by using the ISPD 2012 Discrete Gate Sizing Contest infrastructure, show that our technique is able to optimize a circuit with up to 959K gates within only 51 minutes.

In the current stage, the failure rate of TSV is still high, so some type of defect tolerance scheme is required. Meanwhile, the concept of double-via, which is normally used in traditional layer to layer interconnection, can be one of the feasible tolerance schemes. Double-via/TSV has a benefit compared to TSV repair: it can eliminate the fuse configuration procedure as well as the fuse layer. However, double-TSV has a problem of signal degradation and leakage caused by short defects. In this work, an enhanced scheme for double-TSV is proposed to solve the short-defect problem through signal path division and VDD isolation.

In this paper we provide a drastically different approach for fault tolerant scheduling (FTS) of tasks in such processors. Traditionally in FTS, error detection is performed implicitly and concurrently with task execution, and associated overheads are incurred as increases in software run-time or hardware area. However, such embedded error detection (EED) techniques, e.g., watchdog processor assisted control flow checking, only provide approximately 70% error coverage [1, 2]. We propose the idea of utilizing straightforward explicit output comparison (EOC) which provides nearly 100% error coverage. We construct a framework for utilizing EOC in FTS, identify new challenges and tradeoffs, and develop a new off-line scheduling algorithm for EOC. We show that our EOC based approach provides higher error coverage and an average performance improvement of nearly 10% over EED-based FTS approaches, without increasing resource requirements. In our ongoing research we are identifying a richer set of ways of applying EOC, by itself and in conjunction with EED, to obtain further improvements.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513641","","Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules","","","","2","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integration of IP blocks within SoCs always brought software integration aspects with it. However, since these subsystems increasingly consist of programmable processors, many more layers of firmware and software need to be integrated. In the imaging domain, this is particularly true. Imaging subsystems typically are highly heterogeneous, with high levels of parallelism. The construction of their firmware requires target-specific optimization, yet needs to take interoperability with sensor input systems and graphics/display subsystems into account. Hard real-time scheduling within the subsystem needs to cooperate with less stringent image analytics and SoC-level (OS) scheduling. In many of today's systems, the latter often only supports soft scheduling deadlines. At HW level, IP subsystems need to be integrated such that they can efficiently exchange both short-latency control signals and high-bandwidth data-plane blocks. Solutions exist, but need to be properly configured. However, at the SW level, currently no support exists that provides (i) efficient programmability, (ii) SW abstraction of all the different HW features of these blocks, and (iii) interoperability of these blocks. Starting points could be languages such as OpenCL and OpenCV, which do provide some abstractions, but are not yet sufficiently versatile.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513494","ASIP;IP integration;MPSoC;Software;imaging","Graphics;IP networks;Imaging;Program processors;Scheduling;System-on-chip","","","","0","","3","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our analysis suggests that current state-of-the-art TSV dimensions allow inter-die column repair schemes at the expense of reasonable area overhead.

Among other aspects, this research has produced foundational work on the specification, analysis and component configuration of software architectures, including the development of associated software tools. However, adoption of the research by industry has been largely methodological rather than based on precise specifications in architecture description languages (ADLs) or rigorously underpinned by formal models of behaviour and non-functional attributes. Why is this? Why were the actual formalisms and tools not more widely adopted? Can we draw any lessons from this? In this talk, I hope to explore this further, drawing on my personal experience as a researcher in distributed software architectures. I particularly hope to tickle the fancy of the younger members of our community, indicating the excitement of research, the benefits of belonging to a vibrant research community such as ours, and the benefits of being an active contributor.

Already now, it is necessary to study how to manage such systems when dynamically scheduling applications with different phases of parallelism and resource demands. A recent research area called invasive computing proposes a decentralized workload management scheme of such systems: applications may dynamically claim additional processors during execution and release these again, respectively. In this paper, we study how to apply the concepts of invasive computing for realizing decentralized core allocation schemes in homogeneous many-core systems with the goal of maximizing the average speedup of running applications at any point in time. A theoretical analysis based on game theory shows that it is possible to define a core allocation scheme that uses local information exchange between applications only, but is still able to provably converge to optimal results. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that this allocation scheme reduces the overhead in terms of exchanged messages by up to 61.4% and even the convergence time by up to 13.4% compared to an allocation scheme where all applications exchange information globally with each other.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513751","","Convergence;Games;Nash equilibrium;Nickel;Program processors;Resource management;Scalability","","","","4","","9","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In High Level Synthesis (HLS) flows this is commonly obtained through the scheduling task. However for some HLS approaches, such a relation can be difficult to be computed, or not statically computable at all, and adopting conventional register binding techniques, even when feasible, cannot guarantee maximum performances. To overcome these issues we introduce a novel scheduling-independent liveness analysis methodology, suitable for dynamic scheduling architectures. Such liveness analysis is exploited in register binding using standard graph coloring techniques, and unlike other approaches it avoids the insertion of structural dependencies, introduced to prevent run-time resource conflicts in dynamic scheduling environments. The absence of additional dependencies avoids performance degradation and makes parallelism exploitation independent from the register binding task, while on average not impacting on area, as shown through the experimental results.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513765","","Dynamic scheduling;Equations;Reactive power;Registers;Resource management;Schedules;Standards","","","","2","","12","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we devise novel system-level methods that address the two main sources of dark silicon using superlattice TECs. Our methods leverage the TECs in conjunction with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and number of threads to maximize the performance of multi-core processor under thermal and power constraints. Using an experimental setup based on a quad-core processor, we provide an evaluation of the trade-offs among performance, temperature and power consumption arising from the use of superlattice-based TECs. Our results demonstrate the potential of this emerging cooling technology in mitigating dark silicon problems and in improving the performance of multi-core processors.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513730","","Mathematical model;Multicore processing;Resistance heating;Silicon;Superlattices;Thermal resistance;Throughput","","","","2","","9","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Bounding SDRAM interference: Detailed analysis vs. latency-rate analysis","Shah, Hardik; Knoll, Alois; Akesson, Benny","Fortiss GmbH, Germany","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","308","313","The transition towards multi-processor systems with shared resources is challenging for real-time systems, since resource interference between concurrent applications must be bounded using timing analysis. There are two common approaches to this problem: 1) Detailed analysis that models the particular resource and arbiter cycle-accurately to achieve tight bounds. 2) Using temporal abstractions, such as latency-rate (LR) servers, to enable unified analysis for different resources and arbiters using well-known timing analysis frameworks. However, the use of abstraction typically implies reducing the tightness of analysis that may result in over-dimensioned systems, although this pessimism has not been properly investigated. This paper compares the two approaches in terms of worst-case execution time (WCET) of applications sharing an SDRAM memory under Credit-Controlled Static-Priority (CCSP) arbitration. The three main contributions are: 1) A detailed interference analysis of the SDRAM memory and CCSP arbiter. 2) Based on the detailed analysis, two optimizations are proposed to the LR analysis that increase the tightness of its interference bounds. 3) An experimental comparison of the two approaches that quantifies their impact on the WCET of applications from the CHStone benchmark.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513521","","Clocks;Equations;Interference;Optimization;SDRAM;Servers;Timing","","","","3","","15","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is error prone as it relies on software logs and human analysis, and requires an existing platform. To overcome these issues and automate the process, we propose the conjoint use of a virtual platform logging at hardware level the memory accesses and of a data-mining approach to automatically report unexpected instructions timings, and the context of occurrence of these instructions.

The optimum ratio for the channel width division is a function of relative significances of the two types of communications. Simulation results indicate that for non-uniform traffic constituting of more than 30 percent local traffic, the proposed network, on average provides 64% and 70% improvement over the conventional one in terms of average network latency and Energy-Delay product (EDP), respectively.

To overcome such a poor endurance characteristic and to provide a reasonable storage lifetime, system-level endurance enhancement techniques are rapidly adopted in recent NAND flash-based storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs). In this paper, we propose an integrated lifetime management approach for SSDs. The proposed lifetime management technique combines several lifetime-enhancement schemes, including lossless compression, deduplication, and performance throttling, in an integrated fashion so that the lifetime of SSDs can be maximally extended. By selectively disabling less effective lifetime-enhancement schemes, the proposed technique achieves both high performance and high energy efficiency while meeting the required lifetime. Our evaluation results show that the proposed technique, over the SSDs with no lifetime management schemes, improves write performance by up to 55% and reduces energy consumption by up to 43% while satisfying a 5-year lifetime warranty.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513755","","Ash;Energy consumption;Hardware;Media;Memory management;Software;Time factors","","","","1","","3","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to get high performance for these kernels, it is mandatory to restructure the application, to generate adequate communication mechanisms for the transfer of remote data, and to make good usage of the memory bandwidth. In the context of the high-level synthesis (HLS), from a C program, of hardware accelerators on FPGA, we show how to automatically generate optimized remote accesses for an accelerator communicating to an external DDR memory. Loop tiling is used to enable block communications, suitable for DDR memories. Pipelined communication processes are generated to overlap communications and computations, thereby hiding some latencies, in a way similar to double buffering. Finally, not only intra-tile but also inter-tile data reuse is exploited to avoid remote accesses when data are already available in the local memory. Our first contribution is to show how to generate the sets of data to be read from (resp. written to) the external memory just before (resp. after) each tile so as to reduce communications and reuse data as much as possible in the accelerator. The main difficulty arises when some data may be (re)defined in the accelerator and should be kept locally. Our second contribution is an optimized code generation scheme, entirely at source-level, i.e., in C, that allows us to compile all the necessary glue (the communication processes) with the same HLS tool as for the computation kernel. Both contributions use advanced polyhedral techniques for program analysis and transformation. Experiments with Altera HLS tools demonstrate how to use our techniques to efficiently map C kernels to FPGA.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513573","","Acceleration;Indexes","","","","2","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important limitation of SystemC regarding performance is that the reference implementation is sequential, and the official semantics makes parallel executions difficult. As the number of cores in computers increase quickly, the ability to take advantage of the host parallelism during a simulation is becoming a major concern. Most existing work on parallelization of SystemC targets cycle-accurate simulation, and would be inefficient on loosely timed systems since they cannot run in parallel processes that do not execute simultaneously. We propose an approach that explicitly targets loosely timed systems, and offers the user a set of primitives to express tasks with duration, as opposed to the notion of time in SystemC which allows only instantaneous computations and time elapses without computation. Our tool exploits this notion of duration to run the simulation in parallel. It runs on top of any (unmodified) SystemC implementation, which lets legacy SystemC code continue running as-it-is. This allows the user to focus on the performance-critical parts of the program that need to be parallelized.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513463","","Computational modeling;Libraries;Parallel processing;Semantics;Synchronization;Time-domain analysis;Time-varying systems","","","","2","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sequentially constructive model of computation (SC MoC) presented here harnesses the synchronous execution model to achieve deterministic concurrency while addressing concerns that synchronous languages are unnecessarily restrictive and difficult to adopt. In essence, the SC MoC extends the classical synchronous MoC by allowing variables to be read and written in any order as long as sequentiality expressed in the program provides sufficient scheduling information to rule out race conditions. The SC MoC is a conservative extension in that programs considered constructive in the common synchronous MoC are also SC and retain the same semantics. In this paper, we identify classes of variable accesses, define sequential constructiveness based on the concept of SC-admissible scheduling, and present a priority-based scheduling algorithm for analyzing and compiling SC programs.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513574","","Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Electronic mail;Instruction sets;Java;Programming;Schedules","","","","2","","18","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To exploit the principle of spatial locality, a requested data set and its adjacent data sets are often loaded from memory to a cache block simultaneously. However, the definition of adjacent data sets is strongly correlated with the memory organization. Commodity memory is a two-dimensional structure with two (row and column) access phases to locate the requested data set. Therefore, the adjacent data sets are neighbors of the requested data set in a linear order. In this paper, we propose a novel memory organization with dual-addressing modes as well as orthogonal memory access mechanisms. Our dual-addressing memory can be efficiently applied to two-dimensional memory access patterns. Furthermore, we propose a cache coherence protocol to tackle the cache coherence issue due to synonym data set of the dual-addressing memory. For benchmark kernels with two-dimensional memory access patterns, the dual-addressing memory achieves 60% performance improvement as compared to conventional memory. Both cache hit rate and cache utilization are improved after removing two-dimensional memory access patterns from conventional memory.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513475","","Coherence;Decoding;Layout;Memory management;Organizations;Protocols;Random access memory","","","","0","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A polynomial-time algorithm, the Software Wear-Leveling (SWL) algorithm, is proposed in this paper to achieve wear-leveling without hardware overhead. According to the experimental results, the proposed technique can reduce the number of writes on the most-written bits by more than 80% when compared with a greedy algorithm, and by around 60% when compared with the existing Optimal Data Allocation (ODA) algorithm with under 6% memory access overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513577","","Hardware;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change materials;Random access memory;Resource management;Software;Software algorithms","","","","6","","18","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, batteries age much faster at high temperature. Extensive experiments have shown that the battery temperature varies dramatically during continuous charge or discharge process. This paper introduces a forced convection cooling technique for the batteries that power a portable system. Since the cooling fan is also powered by the same battery, it is critical to develop a highly effective, low power-consuming solution. In addition, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the service time of a battery equipped with fans and the cycle life of the same battery. In particular, as the fan speed is increased, the power dissipated by the fan goes up and hence the full charge capacity of the battery is lost at a faster rate, but at the same time, the battery temperature remains lower and hence the battery longevity increases. This is the first work that formulates the adaptive thermal management problem for batteries (ATMB) in portable systems and provides a systematic solution for it. A hierarchical algorithm combining reinforcement learning at the lower level and dynamic programming at the upper level is proposed to derive the ATMB policy.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513700","adaptive thermal management;battery system;forced convection cooling","Cooling;Degradation;Discharges (electric);Lithium batteries;Thermal force;Thermal management","","","","1","","14","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a dynamic self-adaptive method is proposed to protect the circuit from the influence of transistor aging. This makes use of aging detection sensors and self-adaptive clock scaling cell. Aging sensors would automatically wake up the clock scaling cell to shift the clock phase of circuits when an error occurs. Then the timing error would be masked by a second sampling with the shifted clock. The method is simulated by Hspice using 65nm technology. The evaluation results show that this method is effective to error resilient with no impact on normal function of circuits, and it improves the MTTF by 1.16 times with 22.73% circuit overheads on average when the phase difference is 20% clock cycle.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513644","","Aging;Clocks;Delays;Flip-flops;Sensors;Transistors","","","","0","","10","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introducing reconfigurable nodes in the shared sensor networks can improve the performance, the energy efficiency and the flexibility but it increases the system complexity.

This is challenging for critical SoC components, such as memory controllers. Existing memory controllers focus on either firm real-time or soft real-time applications. FRT controllers use a close-page policy that maximizes worst-case performance and ignore opportunities to exploit locality, since it cannot be guaranteed. Conversely, SRT controllers try to reduce latency and consequently processor stalling by speculating on locality. They often use an open-page policy that sacrifices guaranteed performance, but is beneficial in the average case. This paper proposes a conservative open-page policy that improves average-case performance of a FRT controller in terms of bandwidth and latency without sacrificing real-time guarantees. As a result, the memory controller efficiently handles both FRT and SRT applications. The policy keeps pages open as long as possible without sacrificing guarantees and captures locality in this window. Experimental results show that on average 70% of the locality is captured for applications in the CHStone benchmark, reducing the execution time by 17% compared to a close-page policy. The effectiveness of the policy is also evaluated in a multi-application use-case, and we show that the overall average-case performance improves if there is at least one FRT or SRT application that exploits locality.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513564","","Bandwidth;Bismuth;Real-time systems;SDRAM;Schedules;Time factors;Timing","","","","6","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel compiler framework addressing central issues such as how to express the parallelism between multiple conditionals, and how to allocate resources to them to maximize the parallelism. In particular, by separating the handling of control flow and data flow, our framework can be integrated with conventional mapping algorithms for mapping data flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can find and exploit parallelism between multiple conditionals, thereby leading to 2.21 times higher performance on average than a naive approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513767","CGRA;compilation;conditional;predicated execution;predication;reconfigurable architecture","Computer architecture;Decoding;Educational institutions;Kernel;Parallel processing;Process control;Registers","","","","1","","19","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Knowing the status of a residential grid is fundamental to keep high reliability levels while real time monitoring of electric appliances is important to minimize power waste in buildings and to lower the overall energy cost. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for this application field because they consist of low-power, non-invasive and cost-effective intelligent sensor devices. We present a wireless current sensor node (WCSN) for measuring the current drawn by single appliances. The node can self-sustain its operations by harvesting energy from the monitored current. Two AAA batteries are used only as secondary power supply to guarantee a fast start-up of the system. An active ORing subsystem selects automatically the suitable power source, minimizing power losses typical of the classic diode configuration. The node harvests energy when the power consumed by the device under measurement is in the range 10W÷10kW, which also corresponds to the range of current 50mA÷50A drawn directly from the main. Finally the node features a low-power, 32-bit microcontroller for data processing and a wireless transceiver to send data via the IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513687","Wireless sensor networks;active ORing;energy harvesting;energy measuring;smart metering","Current measurement;Energy measurement;Home appliances;Monitoring;Power measurement;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","7","","21","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As MBUs constitute more than 50% of the upsets in latest technologies, error correcting codes or physical interleaving are typically employed to effectively protect out-of-core memory structures, such as caches. However, such methods are not applicable to high-performance in-core arrays, due to computational complexity, high delay and area overhead. To this end, we revisit parity as an effective mechanism to detect errors and we resort to pipeline flushing and checkpointing for correction. We demonstrate that optimal parity tree construction for MBU detection is a computationally complex problem, which we then formulate as an integer-linear-program (ILP). Experimental results on Alpha 21264 and Intel P6 in-core memory arrays demonstrate that optimal parity tree selection can achieve great vulnerability reduction, even when a small number of bits are added to the parity trees, compared to simple heuristics. Furthermore, the ILP formulation allows us to find better solutions by effectively exploring the solution space in the presence of multiple parity trees; results show that the presence of 2 parity trees offers a vulnerability reduction of more than 50% over a single parity tree.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513747","","Cost function;Delays;Equations;Error correction codes;Microprocessors;Random access memory","","","","1","","19","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often, however, out-of-order scheduling is prevented because of the unknown future behavior of the threads. In this paper, we extend the analysis in order to predict the future of candidate threads.

However, this technology has great challenges in the PCM system since an on-going write cannot overlap with other accesses due to large electric current draw for writes. This paper proposes two new mechanisms (PASAK and WAVAK) that leverage subarray-level parallelism to enable a bank to serve a write and multiple reads in parallel without violating power constraints. PASAK exploits the electric current difference between writing a bit 0 and a bit 1, and provides a new power allocation strategy that better utilizes the power budget to mitigate the performance degradation due to bank conflicts. WAVAK adds a simple coding method that inverts all bits to be written if there are more zeros than ones, with a goal to reduce electric current for writes and create larger power surplus to serve more reads if there is no subarray conflict. Experimental results under 4-cores SPEC CPU 2006 workloads show that our proposed mechanisms can reduce memory latency by 68.7% and running time by 34.8% on average, comparing with the standard PCM system.

The proposed Multiple Access Low Energy Cache (MALEC) is based on the observation that consecutive memory references tend to access the same page. It exhibits a performance level similar to state of the art caches, but consumes approximately 48% less energy. This is achieved by deliberately restricting accesses to only 1 page per cycle, allowing the utilization of single-ported TLBs and cache banks, and simplified lookup structures of Store and Merge Buffers. To mitigate performance penalties it shares memory address translation results between multiple memory references, and shares data among loads to the same cache line. In addition, it uses a Page-Based Way Determination scheme that holds way information of recently accessed cache lines in small storage structures called way tables that are closely coupled to TLB lookups and are able to simultaneously service all accesses to a particular page. Moreover, it removes the need for redundant tag-array accesses, usually required to confirm way predictions. For the analyzed workloads, MALEC achieves average energy savings of 48% in the L1 data memory subsystem over a high performance cache interface that supports up to 2 loads and 1 store in parallel. Comparing MALEC and the high performance interface against a low power configuration limited to only 1 load or 1 store per cycle reveals 14% and 15% performance gain requiring 22% less and 48% more energy, respectively. Furthermore, Page-Based Way Determination exhibits coverage of 94%, which is a 16% improvement over the originally proposed line-based way determination.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513531","","Computational efficiency;Out of order;Random access memory","","","","2","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

D-MRAM has advantage to reduce static power consumptions compared to the conventional SRAM, because there are no static leakage paths in the D-MRAM cell and it is not needed to supply voltage to its cells when used as the MRAM-mode. Besides, with advanced perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJ), which decreases the write energy and latency without shortening its retention time, D-MRAM is capable of power reduction by replacing the traditional SRAM caches. Considering the 65-nm CMOS technology, the access latencies of 1MB memory macro are 2.2 ns / 1.5 ns for read / write in DRAM mode, and 2.2 ns / 4.5 ns in MRAM mode, while those of SRAM are 1.17 ns. The SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks have revealed that the energy per instruction (EPI) of the total cache memory can be dramatically reduced by 71 % on average, and the instruction per cycle (IPC) performance of the D-MRAM cache architecture degraded only by approximately 4 % on average in spite of its latency overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513809","","Cache memory;Memory management;Microprocessors;Mobile communication;Power demand;Random access memory","","","","2","","31","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Programming many-core architectures not only needs parallel programming skills, but also efficient exploitation of fine grain parallelism at both architecture and runtime levels. Scheduler reactivity is however increasingly important as tasks granularity is reduced, in order to keep the overhead of the scheduling to a minimum. This paper presents a lightweight fork-join framework for scheduling fine grain parallel tasks on embedded many-core systems. The asynchronous nature of the fork-join model used in this framework permits to dramatically decrease its scheduling overhead. Experimentation conducted in this paper show that the overhead induced by this framework is of 33 cycles per scheduled task. Also, we show that near-ideal speedup can be obtained by the ARTM framework for data parallel applications and that ARTM achieves better results than other state of the art parallelization techniques.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513753","","Computer architecture;Decoding;Instruction sets;Processor scheduling;Programming","","","","1","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has become a particularly interesting problem with the introduction of dynamic electricity energy pricing models since electricity consumers can use their PV-based energy generation and EES systems for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electricity bill. Due to the characteristics of a realistic electricity price function and the energy storage capacity limitation, the control algorithm for a residential EES system should accurately account for various energy loss components during operation. Hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) systems are proposed to exploit the strengths of each type of EES element and hide its weaknesses so as to achieve a combination of performance metrics that is superior to those of any of its individual EES components. This paper introduces the problem of how best to utilize a HEES system for a residential Smart Grid user equipped with PV power generation facilities. The optimal control algorithm for the HEES system is developed, which aims at minimization of the total electricity cost over a billing period under a general electricity energy price function. The proposed algorithm is based on dynamic programming and has polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HEES system and optimal control algorithm achieves 73.9% average profit enhancement over baseline homogeneous EES systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513632","hybrid electrical energy storage system;optimal control;smart grid","Arrays;Batteries;Control systems;Lead;Power generation;Smart grids;System-on-chip","","","","2","","17","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to maintain the power budget, power gating technique is widely used to reduce the leakage power. However, it will introduce significant power/ground (P/G) noises, and threat the reliability of MPSoCs. With significant area, power and performance overheads, traditional methods rely on reinforced circuits or fixed protection strategies to reduce P/G noises caused by power gating. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to actively alleviating P/G noises using the parasitic capacitance of on-chip memories through sensor network on-chip (SENoC). We utilize the parasitic capacitance of on-chip memories as dynamic decoupling capacitance to suppress P/G noises and develop a detailed Hspice model for related study. SENoC is developed to not only monitor and report P/G noises but also coordinate processing units and memories to alleviate such transient threats at run time. Extensive evaluations show that compared with traditional methods, our approach saves 11.7% to 62.2% energy consumption and achieves 13.3% to 69.3% performance improvement for different applications and MPSoCs with different scales.

This paper presents a power saving solution for datacenters that especially targets the distinctive characteristics of the scale-out applications. More specifically, we take into account correlation information of core utilization among virtual machines (VMs) in server consolidation to lower actual peak server utilization. Then, we utilize this reduction to achieve further power savings by aggressively-yet-safely lowering the server operating voltage and frequency level. We have validated the effectiveness of the proposed solution using 1) multiple clusters of real-life scale-out application workloads based web search and 2) utilization traces obtained from real datacenter setups.

For memory intensive applications, recent research has demonstrated the benefits of introducing high capacity on-chip L4-DRAM as Last-Level-Cache between L3-SRAM and off-chip memory. These multi-core cache hierarchies attempt to exploit the latency benefits of L3-SRAM and capacity benefits of L4-DRAM caches. However, not taking into consideration the cache access patterns of complex applications can cause inter-core DRAM interference and inter-core cache contention. In this paper, we contest to re-architect existing cache hierarchies by proposing a hybrid cache architecture, where the Last-Level-Cache is a combination of SRAM and DRAM caches. We propose an adaptive DRAM placement policy in response to the diverse requirements of complex applications with different cache access behaviors. It reduces inter-core DRAM interference and inter-core cache contention in SRAM/DRAM-based hybrid cache architectures: increasing the harmonic mean instruction-per-cycle throughput by 23.3% (max. 56%) and 13.3% (max. 35.1%) compared to state-of-the-art.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513476","","Arrays;Interference;Magnetic cores;Phase change random access memory;Radiation detectors;System-on-chip","","","","2","","20","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, to take advantage of the benefits from multi-core platforms, it is best to re-engineer the underlying algorithms, such as whether traditional depth-first search (DFS) construction, breadth-first search (BFS) construction, or a hybrid BFS with DFS would be best. In this paper, we introduce a novel BDD package friendly to multicore platforms that builds on a number of heuristics.

This framework allows for flexible implementations of transactional memories based on an adaptation of the MESI coherence protocol. FlexTM allows for both eager and lazy conflict resolution strategies. Like in the case of Software Transactional Memories, the verification problem is not trivial as the number of concurrent transactions, their size, and the number of accessed shared variables cannot be a priori bounded. This complexity is exacerbated by aspects that are specific to hardware and hybrid transactional memories. Our work takes into account intricate behaviours such as cache line based conflict detection, false sharing, invisible reads or non-transactional instructions. We carry out the first automatic verification of a hybrid transactional memory and establish, by adopting a small model approach, challenging properties such as strict serializability, abort consistency, and obstruction freedom for both an eager and a lazy conflict resolution strategies. We also detect an example that refutes livelock freedom. To achieve this, our prototype tool makes use of the latest antichain based techniques to handle systems with tens of thousands of states.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513613","","Abstracts;Flexible printed circuits;Hardware","","","","0","","25","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"TreeFTL: Efficient RAM management for high performance of NAND flash-based storage systems","Wang, Chundong; Wong, Weng-Fai","School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","374","379","NAND flash memory is widely used for secondary storage today. The flash translation layer (FTL) is the embedded software that is responsible for managing and operating in flash storage system. One important module of the FTL performs RAM management. It is well-known to have a significant impact on flash storage system's performance. This paper proposes an efficient RAM management scheme called TreeFTL. As the name suggests, TreeFTL organizes address translation pages and data pages in RAM in a tree structure, through which it dynamically adapts to workloads by adjusting the partitions for address mapping and data buffering. TreeFTL also employs a lightweight mechanism to implement the least recently used (LRU) algorithm for RAM cache evictions. Experiments show that compared to the two latest schemes for RAM management in flash storage system, TreeFTL can reduce service time by 46.6% and 49.0% on average, respectively, with a 64MB RAM cache.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513532","","Ash;Educational institutions;Memory management;Nonvolatile memory;Partitioning algorithms;Performance evaluation;Random access memory","","","","1","","16","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next Recursive Vector Fitting (RVF) algorithm is used to extract an analytical Hammerstein model out of the TFT data in an automated fashion. The resulting RVF model equations are implemented as an accurate nonlinear behavioral model in the time domain.

Hence, it is vital to continuously improve the capabilities and efficiency of these large-scale systems. Over the past ten years, capability has improved by increasing the number of servers in a DC and the bandwidth of the network that connects them. Cost and energy efficiency have improved by eliminating the high overheads of the power delivery and cooling infrastructure. To achieve further improvements, we must now examine how well we are utilizing the servers themselves, which are the primary determinant for DC performance, cost, and energy efficiency. This is particularly important since the semiconductor chips used in servers are now energy limited and their efficiency does not scale as fast as in the past. This paper motivates the need for resource efficient computing in large-scale datacenters and reviews the major challenges and research opportunities.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513724","","Servers","","","","0","","27","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Executing instruction streams redundantly in chip multi processors (CMP) provides high reliability since it can detect both transient and permanent faults. Additionally, it also minimizes the Silent Data Corruption rate. However, comparing the results of the instruction streams, checkpointing the entire system and recovering from the detected errors might lead to substantial performance degradation. In this study we propose FaulTM, an error detection and recovery schema utilizing Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) in order to reduce these performance degradations. We show how a minimally modified HTM that features lazy conflict detection and lazy data versioning can provide low-cost reliability in addition to HTM's intended purpose of supporting optimistic concurrency.

Abstraction is often performed by selecting a subset of gates to be included in the abstracted model; the signals feeding into this subset become unconstrained cut-points. In this paper, we propose several improvements to substantially increase the scalability of automated abstraction. In particular, we show how a better integration between the BMC engine and the SAT solver is achieved, resulting in a new hybrid abstraction engine, that is faster and uses less memory. This engine speeds up computation by constant propagation and circuit-based structural hashing while collecting UNSAT cores for the intermediate proofs in terms of a subset of the original variables.

In this paper we will show how Hardware Intrinsic Security (HIS) can be used to prevent various forms of counterfeiting and over-production. HIS technology can also be used to bind software or user data to specific hardware devices, which provides additional security to both soft- and hardware vendors as well as consumers using HIS-enabled products.

"A universal macro block mapping scheme for arithmetic circuits","Xing Wei; Yi Diao; Tak-Kei Lam; Yu-Liang Wu","","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2015","20150423","2015","","","1629","1634","A macro block is a functional unit that can be re-used in circuit designs. The problem of general macro block mapping is to identify such embedded parts, whose I/O signals are unknown, from the netlist that may have been optimized in various ways. The mapping results can then be used to ease the functional verification process or for replacement by more advanced intellectual property (IP) macros. In the past literatures, the mapping problem is mostly limited to the identification of a single adder or multiplier with I/O signals given, which is already NP-hard. However, in today's typical arithmetic circuits (like digital signal processing (DSP) applications), it is not unusual to have combinations of arithmetic operators implemented as macro blocks for performance gain. To solve this new practical mapping problem, we propose a flow to identify and build a forest of one-bit-adder trees using structural information and formal verification techniques, followed by algorithms that locate macro boundaries and I/O signal orders. Experimental results show that our algorithm is highly practical and scalable. It is capable of identifying any combinations of arbitrary adders and multipliers such as (a + b) × c and a × b + c × d +e × f, where each operand is a multi-bit constant or variable. Most of the benchmarks in ICCAD 2013 CAD Contest [1] can be well handled by our algorithm.","","978-3-9815-3704-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092654","Adder;Arithmetic logic;Multiplier;Technology mapping","Adders;Boolean functions;Data structures;Indexes;Logic gates;Pins;Vegetation","adders;formal verification;logic circuits;logic design;multiplying circuits","DSP;I/O signals;ICCAD 2013 CAD contest;NP-hard;arbitrary adders;arithmetic circuits;circuit designs;digital signal processing;embedded parts;formal verification techniques;intellectual property macros;macro block mapping;multipliers;one-bit-adder trees;single adder;structural information","","0","","","","","9-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
