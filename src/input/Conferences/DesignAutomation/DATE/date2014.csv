"Over-approximating loops to prove properties using bounded model checking","Darke, P.; Chimdyalwar, B.; Venkatesh, R.; Shrotri, U.; Metta, R.","","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2015","20150423","2015","","","1407","1412","Bounded Model Checkers (BMCs) are widely used to detect violations of program properties up to a bounded execution length of the program. However when it comes to proving the properties, BMCs are unable to provide a sound result for programs with loops of large or unknown bounds. To address this limitation, we developed a new loop over-approximation technique LA. LA replaces a given loop in a program with an abstract loop having a smaller known bound by combining the techniques of output abstraction and a novel abstract acceleration, suitably augmented with a new application of induction. The resulting transformed program can then be fed to any bounded model checker to provide a sound proof of the desired properties. We call this approach, of LA followed by BMC, as LABMC. We evaluated the effectiveness of LABMC on some of the SV-COMP14 loop benchmarks, each with a property encoded into it. Well known BMCs failed to prove most of these properties due to loops of large, infinite or unknown bounds while LABMC obtained promising results. We also performed experiments on a real world automotive application on which the well known BMCs were able to prove only one of the 186 array accesses to be within array bounds. LABMC was able to successfully prove 131 of those array accesses to be within array bounds.","","978-3-9815-3704-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092611","","Acceleration;Arrays;Automation;Automotive applications;Benchmark testing;Europe;Model checking","program control structures;program verification","BMCs;LABMC;SV-COMP14 loop benchmarks;abstract acceleration;array bounds;bounded model checking;loop abstraction;loop over-approximation technique;output abstraction;program properties;software verification competition 2014","","0","","","","","9-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a new approach to the use of test cube merging for the generation of compact diagnostic test sets. For this the paper uses the new concept of non-test cubes. While a test cube for a fault f<sub>i0</sub> detects the fault, a non-test cube for a fault f<sub>i1</sub> prevents the fault from being detected. Merging a test cube for a fault f<sub>i0</sub> and a non-test cube for a fault f<sub>i1</sub> produces a diagnostic test cube that distinguishes the two faults.

Every produced chip undergoes at least a production test supported by on-chip test infrastructure to reduce test cost. Throughout the technology evolution fault tolerance gained importance and is now necessary in many applications to mitigate soft errors threatening consistent operation. While a variety of effective solutions exists to tackle both areas, test and fault tolerance are often implemented orthogonally, and hence do not exploit the potential synergies of a combined solution. The unified architecture presented here facilitates fault tolerance and test by combining a checksum of the sequential state with the ability to flip arbitrary bits. Experimental results confirm a reduced area overhead compared to a orthogonal combination of classical test and fault tolerance schemes. In combination with heuristically generated test sequences the test application time and test data volume are reduced significantly.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800407","ATPG;Bit-Flipping Scan;Compaction;Fault Tolerance;Satisfiability;Test","Circuit faults;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Latches;Logic gates;Registers","fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing","arbitrary bits;area overhead reduction;bit-flipping scan;checksum;digital circuits;fault tolerance schemes;heuristically generated test sequences;offline test;on-chip test infrastructure;orthogonal combination;production test;sequential state;soft error mitigation;technology evolution;test application time;test data volume;unified architecture","","0","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic specification granularity tuning for design space exploration","Jiaxing Zhang; Schirner, G.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Recent tools propose to facilitate algorithm / architecture co-design by bridging the gap from ADE to System-Level Design Environments (SLDE) through automatic synthesis from algorithm models to SLDL specifications. With the wide range of block characteristic (from simple logic functions to complex kernels) in the algorithm model, however, it is challenging to select a suitable compositional granularity for SLD Language (SLDL) blocks in the synthesized specification. A high volume of SLDL blocks of little computation will increase the number of mapping possibilities, whereas large blocks with heavy computation on the other hand allow inter-block fusion reducing the computational demands in the overall specification yet sacrificing the mapping flexibility. In this paper, we introduce an automatic specification granularity tuning mechanism to determine the granularity in the synthesized specification model hierarchy guided by the computational demands of algorithm blocks. Our granularity selection significantly simplifies the early design space exploration as only a meaningful block decomposition is exposed in the synthesized specification. It leads to an overall system with less computational demands by leveraging the block fusion capabilities in the ADE. At the same time our granularity decision ensures that sufficient flexibility remains in the system for exploring heterogeneous mapping of the algorithm. Our results on real world examples show that specification models can be synthesized with 80% efficiency through block fusion with 70-90% fewer but coarser grained blocks.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800428","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Merging;Optimization;Software packages;Tuning;Unified modeling language","electronic design automation;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","ADE;SLDE;SLDL blocks;Simulink;algorithm design environments;architecture co-design;automatic specification granularity tuning mechanism;automatic synthesis;block decomposition;design space exploration;granularity decision;granularity selection;interblock fusion;mapping flexibility;synthesized specification model hierarchy;system level design language;system-level design environments","","0","","16","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Sub-threshold logic circuit design using feedback equalization","Zangeneh, M.; Joshi, A.","Electr. & Comput. Eng. Dept., Boston Univ., Boston, MA, USA","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","Low energy has become one of the primary constraint in the design of digital VLSI circuits in recent years. Minimum-energy consumption can be achieved in digital circuits by operating in the sub-threshold regime. However, in this regime process variation can result in up to an order of magnitude variations in I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off</sub> ratios leading to timing errors, which can have a detrimental impact on the functionality of the sub-threshold circuits. These timing errors become more frequent in scaled technology nodes where process variations are highly prevalent. Therefore, mechanisms to mitigate these timing errors while minimizing the energy consumption in sub-threshold circuits are required. In this paper, we propose the use of a variable threshold feedback equalizer circuit with combinational logic blocks to mitigate the timing errors, which can then be leveraged to reduce the dominant leakage energy by scaling supply voltage or decreasing the propagation delay. At the fixed supply voltage, we can decrease the propagation delay of the critical path using equalizer circuits and, correspondingly decrease the leakage energy consumption. For a 8-bit carry lookahead adder designed in UMC 130 nm process, the operating frequency can be increased by 22.87% (on average), while reducing the leakage energy by 22.6% in the sub-threshold regime. Overall the feedback equalization technique provides up to 35.4% lower energy-delay product compared to the conventional non-equalized logic. Alternately, for a 8-bit carry lookahead adder, the proposed technique enables us to reduce the critical voltage (beyond which timing errors occur) from 300 mV (nominal design) to 270 mV (design with feedback circuit), and provides a 16.72% decrease in energy per operation while maintaining performance.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800322","","Adders;Equalizers;Logic gates;Propagation delay;Threshold voltage;Timing;Transistors","VLSI;adders;circuit feedback;combinational circuits;equalisers;integrated logic circuits;logic design;low-power electronics","UMC process;carry lookahead adder;combinational logic blocks;digital VLSI circuit design;dominant leakage energy;energy-delay product;minimum-energy consumption;propagation delay;size 130 nm;sub-threshold logic circuit design;supply voltage scaling;timing errors;variable threshold feedback equalizer circuit;voltage 300 mV to 270 mV;word length 8 bit","","0","","19","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mission profile awareness aids the automation of robustness aware design by formalizing and partially automating the generation, transformation, propagation and usage of all component-specific functional loads and environmental conditions for design implementation and validation. In addition, it aids the development of electronic components in yet immature technologies or in technologies with tight parameter variation bounds. This paper introduces the general concept, requirements and context of mission profile aware design.

The scheme targets high stuck-at-fault (SAF) coverage by performing scan-chain free functional testing, to prevent scan-chain abuse for attacks. The scheme reuses existing FE sub-blocks (for pattern generation and compression) to minimize the area overhead. The scheme is integrated in FE design and simulated; the results show that a SAF fault coverage of 95.1% can be realized with no more than 50k clock cycles at the cost of a negligible area overhead of only 2.2%. Higher fault coverage is possible to realize at extra cost.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800408","Extractor;Fuzzy;PUF-based;Scan-chain free test;Secure Testing;systems","Circuit faults;Clocks;Cryptography;Decoding;Error correction;Iron;Testing","VLSI;built-in self test;design for testability;fuzzy set theory;integrated circuit testing","BIST;FE sub-blocks;PUF-based secure key storage circuit testing;SAF;VLSI chip;built-in self-test;design for testability;fuzzy extractor;high stuck-at-fault;physical unclonable function based systems;scan-chain free functional testing;test circuitry","","0","","25","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the past two decades, top-down hierarchical design approaches have been developed and applied. They are based on hierarchical circuit decomposition and specification transmission from top-level to lower level blocks. However, such specification transmission is usually performed with little knowledge on the feasibility of the specifications, leading, therefore, to costly redesign iterations. Even if the specification transmission is successful, there is no guarantee that it is optimal in terms of e.g., power consumption or area occupation. To palliate this problem, two novel model-based hierarchical synthesis methods are proposed in this paper: ModelBased Hierarchical Optimization (MBHO) and Improved ModelBased Hierarchical Optimization (IMBHO). They are based on the concurrent design at higher and lower hierarchical levels and appropriate communication between the different processes. Experimental results on a filter example comparing the new approaches and the conventional top-down design approach are provided.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800228","","Computational modeling;Cutoff frequency;Equations;Mathematical model;Optimization;Power demand","analogue circuits;electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;optimisation","analog circuits design;analog design automation;hierarchical circuit decomposition;model based hierarchical optimization strategies;specification transmission","","0","","12","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Coarse-grained Bubble Razor to exploit the potential of two-phase transparent latch designs","Hayoung Kim; Dongyoung Kim; Jae-Joon Kim; Sungjoo Yoo; Sunggu Lee","Dept. of Electr.

(POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","Timing margin to cover process variation is one of the most critical factors that limit the amount of supply voltage reduction thereby power consumption. To remove too conservative timing margin, Bubble Razor was introduced to dynamically detect and correct errors in two-phase transparent latch designs [13]. However, it does not fully exploit the potential of two-phase transparent latch design, e.g. time borrowing. Thus, especially at low supply voltage where the effect of process variation becomes significant, the existing Bubble Razor can suffer from significant overhead in performance and power consumption due to too frequent occurrence of bubble generations. We present a design methodology for coarse-grained Bubble Razor which exploits the time-borrowing characteristic of two-phase transparent latch design. By selectively inserting error checkpoints, i.e., shadow latches and error management logic, in the circuit, time borrowing can be applied between error checkpoints thereby avoiding bubbles which could occur in the existing Bubble Razor design with a checkpoint at every latch on the critical path. We present a methodology to choose the grain size (the number of stages between error checkpoints) based on 3-sigma delay distribution. We also verify the benefits of coarse-grained Bubble Razor with a real microprocessor, Core-A design [15] using 20nm Predictive Technology Model (PTM) [16]. The proposed methodology offers 62% improvement in performance (MIPS) and 49% less energy consumption (per instruction) at 0.6V operation (zero frequency margin) over the original Bubble Razor scheme. In addition, it gives 25% area reduction in core design.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800580","","Clocks;Delays;Flip-flops;Grain size;Latches;Pipelines","bubbles;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;logic circuits;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","3-sigma delay distribution;PTM;bubble generations;coarse-grained bubble razor;core-a design;energy consumption;error checkpoints;error management logic;grain size;microprocessor;power consumption;predictive technology model;process variation;shadow latches;size 20 nm;supply voltage reduction;time borrowing characteristic;timing margin;two-phase transparent latch designs;voltage 0.6 V;zero frequency margin","","0","","16","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A potential application is memory stacked on logic, providing enhanced throughput, and reduced latency and power consumption. However, testing the TSV interconnects between the two dies is challenging, as both the memory and the logic die might come from different manufacturers. Currently, no standard exists and the proposed solutions fail to address dynamic and time-critical faults (at speed testing). In addition, memory vendors have not been in favor to put additional DfT structures such as JTAG for interconnect testing on their memory devices. This paper proposes a new Memory Based Interconnect Test (MBIT) approach for 3D stacked memories. Our test patterns are applied by read and write instructions to the memory and are validated by a case study where a 3D memory is assumed to be stacked on a MIPS64 processor. The main benefits of the MBIT approach are: (1) zero area overhead, (2) the ability to detect both static and dynamic faults and perform at speed testing, (3) flexibility in applying any test pattern, as this can be executed by the CPU on the logic die and (4) extreme short test execution time.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800340","3D-SIC;interconnect testing;memory-on-logic","Bridges;Circuit faults;Crosstalk;Delays;Memory management;Testing;Through-silicon vias","design for testability;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit testing;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D memory;3D stacked memory-on-logic;3D-SIC technology;CPU;DfT structures;JTAG;MBIT approach;MIPS64 processor;TSV interconnects;dynamic faults;interconnect testing;logic die;memory based interconnect test approach;memory devices;memory die;memory stacked on logic;memory vendors;read and write instructions;speed testing;static faults;test patterns;three-dimensional stacked IC technology;through-silicon vias;time-critical faults","","0","","30","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These fabricated structures typically employ devices with in-plane magnetization to move and process data. However, in-plane layouts imply circuits and interconnects in only two dimensions (2D), which makes signal routing - and hence circuits - more complex. In this paper, we introduce NML circuits that move and process data in three dimensions (3D). We employ devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) (i.e., out-of-plane magnetization states) and discuss their behavior when utilized in 3D designs. Furthermore, we provide a systematic design approach for 3D NML circuits using a threshold full adder as a case study.

We propose to use reconfigurable functional units to overcome these challenges. A selected set of complex functional units that might be underutilized, such as a multiplier and divider, are realized in a time-multiplexed fashion using a shared programmable Look Up Table (LUT) based fabric. This allows for run-time reconfiguration and migration of their activity. LUT based implementation also allows under-utilized functional units to be dynamically reconfigured to the functional units that have a performance bottleneck and hence improving performance. The programmable LUTs are realized using Spin Transfer Torque (STT) Magnetic technology (also called STT-NV) due to its zero leakage and CMOS compatibility. The results show significant performance improvement of 16% on average across standard benchmarks, when replacing CMOS multiplier and divider with reconfigurable STT-NV LUT counterpart. In addition, reconfiguration reduces the maximum temperature of functional units by up to 27<sup>°</sup>C and almost eliminates the thermal variation across them. This comes with small power overhead and no area impact.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800549","STT-NV logic;divider;functional units;low power;low temperature;multiplier;reconfigurable architecture","Adders;Benchmark testing;CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Magnetic tunneling;Program processors;Table lookup","embedded systems;low-power electronics;magnetoelectronics;microprocessor chips;table lookup;thermal management (packaging)","CMOS compatibility;CMOS divider;CMOS multiplier;STT-NV technology;high performance functional unit design;low power functional unit design;low temperature functional unit design;reconfigurable functional unit design;run time reconfiguration;shared programmable look up table;spin transfer torque magnetic technology;zero leakage","","0","","22","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the development and design of advanced neural recording systems is very challenging since the number of parallel measurement channels increases continuously. Beside the analog recording channels digital preprocessing becomes mandatory to handle the corresponding amount of data and to adapt this data to the available transmission bandwidth. In this paper we present the design as well as the behavioral modeling of an analog recording front-end. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate the performances of the system for recording neural signals. Since simulation of this analog front-end is very time consuming but essential for large fully-integrated designs, a mixed-signal model approach is introduced that enables a significant simulation acceleration of integrated and external analog front-ends. The simulation can be accelerated by a factor of up to 22.2 for a single front-end. The proposed system has been fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology and performances have been measured. This demonstrates that the behavioral model is compatible to the transistor level design.

"A multi banked — Multi ported — Non blocking shared L2 cache for MPSoC platforms","Loi, I.; Benini, L.","DEI, Univ. of Bologna, Bologna, Italy","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","On-chip L2 cache architectures, well established in high-performance parallel computing systems, are now becoming a performance-critical component also for multi/many-core architectures targeted at lower-power, embedded applications. The very stringent requirements on power and cost of these systems result in one of the key challenges in many-core designs, mandating the deployment of highly efficient L2 caches. In this perspective, sharing the L2 cache layer among all system cores has important advantages, such as increased utilization, fast inter-core communication, and reduced aggregate footprint because no undesired replication of lines occurs. This paper presents a novel architecture for a shared L2 cache system with multi-port and multi-bank features. We target this L2 cache to a many-core platform based on hierarchical cluster structure that does not employ private data caches, and therefore does not require complex coherency mechanisms. In fact, our shared L2 cache can be seen logically as a Last Level Cache (LLC) adopting the terminology of higher-performance many-core products, although in these latter the LLC is more often an L3 layer. Our experimental results show a maximum aggregate bandwidth of 28GB/s (89% of the maximum channel capacity) for 100% hit traffic with random banking conflicts, as a realistic case. Physical implementation results in 28nm Fully-Depleted-Silicon-on-Insulator (FDSoI) show that our L2 cache can operate at up to 1GHz with a memory density loss of only 20% with respect to an L2 scratchpad for a 2 MB configuration.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800294","","Bandwidth;Banking;Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Random access memory","cache storage;multiprocessing systems;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip","FDSoI;LLC;MPSoC platforms;aggregate bandwidth;fully-depleted-silicon-on-insulator;hierarchical cluster structure;hit traffic;inter-core communication;last level cache;many-core architectures;multibank features;multibanked shared L2 cache;multicore architectures;multiport features;multiported shared L2 cache;nonblocking shared L2 cache;on-chip L2 cache architectures;random banking conflicts;size 28 nm","","0","","13","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the sources of power inefficiency for recent LSI chips is increasing leakage power consumption. Power-gating is a well known technique to reduce leakage power consumption by switching off the power supply to idle logic blocks. Recently, fine-grained power-gating is emerged as a technique to minimize leakage current during the active processor cycles by switching on and off a logic blocks in much finer temporal/spatial granularity. Though fine-grained power-gating is useful, a comprehensive evaluation and analysis has not been conducted on a real LSI chips. In this paper, we evaluate fine-grained run-time power-gating for microprocessors' functional units using a real embedded microprocessor. We also introduce an architecture and compiler co-operative power-gating scheme which mitigates negative power reduction caused by the energy overhead associated with finegrained power-gating. The experimental results with a fabricated core shows that a hardware-based scheme saves power consumption of functional units by 44% and hardware compiler co-operative scheme further improves power efficiency by 5.9% when core temperature is 25 °C.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800359","","Hardware;Leakage currents;Microprocessors;Power demand;Switches;Switching circuits;Transistors","embedded systems;large scale integration;microprocessor chips;power aware computing","LSI chips;efficiency 5.9 percent;embedded microprocessors;fine grained power gating;leakage current;leakage power consumption;logic blocks;negative power reduction;power performance efficiency;power supply;temperature 25 degC","","0","","27","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First of all, we want to operate at low voltage, since this is the point of maximum energy efficiency. Unfortunately, in such an environment, we have to tackle substantial process variation. Hence, it is important to design efficient voltage regulation, so that each region of the chip can operate at the most efficient voltage and frequency point. At the architecture level, we require simple cores organized in a hierarchy of clusters. Moreover, we also need techniques to reduce the leakage of on-chip memories and to lower the voltage guardbands of logic.

In this paper, we apply SAT-based cube generalization, a core step of the IC3 model checking algorithm, to BDD-based over-approximate reachability analysis. More specifically, we use cube generalization, in both its inductive and non-inductive versions, to tighten BDD-based over-approximate representations of state sets computed by Machine by Machine (MBM) and Frame by Frame (FBF) algorithms. The resulting approach benefits from the orthogonal power of BDD and CNF representations, and it improves the scalability and applicability in verification of BDD-based methods.

We usually employ decoupling capacitor (decap) to suppress the noise generated by the switching of devices. There have been numerous prior works on how to select/insert decaps in chip, package, or board to maintain PI, however optimal decap selection is usually not applicable due to design budget and manufacturability. Moreover, design cost is seldom touched or mentioned. In this research, we propose an efficient methodology “PDC-PSO” to automatically optimizing the selection of available decaps. This algorithm not only takes advantage of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to stochastically search the design space, but takes the most effective range of decaps into consideration to outperform the basic PSO. We apply this to three real package designs and the results show that, compared to the original decap selection by rules of thumb, our approach could shorten the design period and we have better combination of decaps at the same or lower cost. In addition, our methodology can also consider package-board co-design in optimizing different operation frequencies.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800260","","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitors;Frequency-domain analysis;Impedance;Noise;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization","capacitors;electron device noise;integrated circuit interconnections;particle swarm optimisation;semiconductor device packaging","PDC-PSO;PDN;PI;decoupling capacitor;design budget;design cost;design space;device switching;die power integrity;manufacturability;optimal decap selection;package-board codesign;particle swarm optimization;power distribution networks;preferred decap choice;real package designs;voltage supply","","0","","20","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach follows a new synthesis paradigm: The designer develops a simple domain and/or design specific language and a smart tool synthesizing implementation level models according to its needs. The overhead of making both a tool and a model pays off since the tool building is automated by code generation and reuse, both based on Metamodeling techniques. Also the focus on owns demand keeps development costs low. Finally, specification data is utilized. I.e. the domain specific language simplifies to a document structure as a table. This keeps also modeling effort low since specification content is used and no model need to be built. Furthermore, increases design consistency and thus decreases debug time. Using these concepts, single design steps have been speed up to a factor of 20x and implementations of chips (specification-to-tapeout) have been speed up to a factor of 3x.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800525","code generation;metamodeling;system level synthesis","Automation;Buildings;Data models;Engines;Generators;Metamodeling;Synthesizers","electronic design automation;program compilers;specification languages","RTL levels;code generation;design specific language;generic design automation strategy;metamodeling approach;schematic entry;smart tool;system level synthesis","","0","","","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experienced designers can directly express their microarchitectural intuitions in RTL. Yet, RTL is terribly verbose, burdened with trivial details, and thus error prone. In this paper, we augment a modern RTL language (Chisel) with new semantic elements to express an imprecise specification: a sketch. We show how, in combination with a naïve, unoptimized, but functionally correct reference, a designer can utilize the language and supporting infrastructure to focus on the key design intuition and omit some of the necessary details. The resulting design is exactly or almost exactly as good as the one the designer could have achieved by spending the time to manually complete the sketch. We show that, even limiting ourselves to combinational circuits, realistic instances of meaningful design problems are solved quickly, saving considerable design and debugging effort.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800366","","Adders;Combinational circuits;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Indexes;Integrated circuit modeling;Software","combinational circuits;logic design","RTL language;SKETCHILOG;design problems;high performance digital designs;higher-level languages;register transfer level;sketching combinational circuits","","0","","12","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper first provides a design space exploration of silicon-photonic networks in manycore systems and quantifies the performance impact of the temperature gradients for various network bandwidths. The paper then introduces a novel job allocation technique that minimizes the temperature gradients among the ring modulators/filters to improve the application performance. Experimental results for a single-chip 256-core system demonstrate that our policy is able to maintain the maximum network bandwidth.

To this end, we have designed a Trojan using power-gating techniques and demonstrate that it can be masked from advanced side-channel fingerprinting detection while dormant.

Targeting this architecture, in this paper, we propose a data placement and memory area allocation algorithm. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to optimize the performance of the memory system by minimizing the on-chip memory access latency, the number of off-chip memory accesses, and the number of reconfigurations. Since the behavior of an embedded system can be described by a set of scenarios, where each scenario specifies a set of applications that would execute concurrently, the proposed algorithm synthesizes data placements and the memory area allocation for each scenario. Not only the data access patterns within the scenario but also among all scenarios are considered for data placement. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a set of synthetic and real-world applications. The experimental results show that, compared to the existing data placement method designed for MPSoCs with distributed memory modules, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 11.72% of data access latency reduction.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800537","","Algorithm design and analysis;IP networks;Interference;Random access memory;Resource management;System-on-chip;Tiles","SRAM chips;distributed memory systems;embedded systems;system-on-chip","3D-stacked reconfigurable SRAM tiles;MP-SoCs;distributed memory modules;embedded systems;memory area allocation algorithm;multiprocessor system-on-chips;off-chip memory accesses;on-chip memory access latency;scenario-aware data placement","","0","","20","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the key issues related to workload consolidation is contention for shared resources such as last level cache, main memory, memory controller, etc. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) of CPU is another effective technique that has widely been used to trade the performance for power reduction. We have found that the degree of resource contention of a system affects its performance sensitivity to CPU frequency. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to construct a model that quantifies runtime performance degradation caused by resource contention and frequency scaling. The inputs of our model are readings from Performance Monitoring Units (PMU) screened using standard feature selection technique. The model is tested on an SMT-enabled chip multi-processor and it reaches up to 90% accuracy. Experimental results show that, guided by the performance model, runtime power management techniques such as DVFS can achieve more accurate power and performance tradeoff without violating the quality of service (QoS) agreement. The QoS violation of the proposed system is significantly lower than systems that have no performance degradation information.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800492","consolidation;contention;frequency scaling;power management","Benchmark testing;Degradation;Hidden Markov models;Phasor measurement units;Quality of service;Sensitivity;Servers","learning (artificial intelligence);power aware computing;quality of service","CMP;DVFS;SMT enabled chip multiprocessor;contention aware frequency scaling;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;energy efficiency;guaranteed quality of service;machine learning techniques;performance monitoring units;power reduction;resource contention;standard feature selection technique","","0","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies are being explored extensively nowadays to replace the conventional SRAM memories even for level 1 (L1) caches. These NVMs like Spin Torque Transfer RAM (STT-MRAM), Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) and Phase Change RAM (PRAM) are less hindered by leakage problems with technology scaling and consume lesser area. However, simple replacement of SRAM by NVMs is not a viable option due to their write related issues. The main focus of this paper is the exploration of write delay and write energy issues in a NVM based L1 Instruction cache (I-cache) for an ARM like single core system. We propose a NVM I-cache and extend its MSHR (Miss Status Handling Register) functionality to address the NVMs write related issues. According to our simulations, appropriate tuning of selective architecture parameters can reduce the performance penalty introduced by the NVM (~45%) to extremely tolerable levels (~1%) and show energy gains up to 35%. Furthermore, on configuring our modified NVM based system to occupy area comparable to the original SRAM-based configuration, it outperforms the SRAM baseline and leads to even more energy savings.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800235","","Benchmark testing;Energy consumption;Nonvolatile memory;Organizations;Program processors;Random access memory;Registers","SRAM chips;cache storage;power aware computing","L1 caches;L1 instruction cache;MSHR enhancements;NVM based I-cache;PRAM;ReRAM;SRAM based memory systems;STT-MRAM;dynamic voltage scaling schemes;level 1 caches;low supply voltage;miss status handling register;nonvolatile memory technologies;phase change RAM;read/write failure;resistive-RAM;spin torque transfer RAM;subthreshold leakage;technology scaling;write delay;write energy issues","","0","","13","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our technique assumes that faulty caches are enhanced with the ability of disabling their defective parts at cache subblock granularity. Our experimental findings reveal that while the occurrence of hard-errors in faulty caches may have a significant impact in performance, a lot of room for improvement exists, if someone is able to take into account the spatial reuse patterns of the to-be-referenced blocks (not all the data fetched into the cache is accessed). To this end, we propose frugal PC-indexed spatial predictors (with very small storage requirements) to orchestrate the (re)placement decisions among the fully and partially unusable faulty blocks. Using cycle-accurate simulations, a wide range of scientific applications, and a plethora of cache fault maps, we showcase that our approach is able to offer significant benefits in cache performance.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800274","","Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Error correction codes;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;SRAM cells","cache storage;content-addressable storage","cache fault maps;cache subblock granularity;cycle-accurate simulations;defective bits;faulty data caches;first-level set-associative data caches;frugal PC-indexed spatial predictors;fully unusable faulty blocks;hard-errors;on-chip caches;partially unusable faulty blocks;scientific applications;spatial pattern prediction based management;spatial reuse patterns;technology scaling;very small storage requirements","","0","","20","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These activity monitors are typically not accessible to the user, and even if they were accessible, there would be a significant overhead in using them at the kernel or OS level for power monitoring or control. Furthermore, when scaled up to hundreds of cores per chip, such power proxies become a computational bottleneck for power management operations such as chip power capping. In this paper, we show that a 4% accuracy or better for per-core power estimation can be achieved using an ultra compact power proxy based on a hybrid set of only four user-accessible parameters, namely core frequency, core temperature, instruction-per-cycle and active-state residency. Our proxy is nonlinear, valid across all P and C states, and is based on a randomized power data collection strategy that aims at exercising all the P and C levels of each core. We illustrate the accuracy of the model using the full suite of the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks on a 12-core processor.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800548","","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Phase change materials;Power demand;Radiation detectors","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","12-core processor;C states;OS level;P states;SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks;active-state residency;chip power capping;core frequency;core temperature;instruction-per-cycle;kernel level;multicore processors;per-core power estimation;per-core power proxies;power control;power data collection strategy;power management operations;power monitoring;quadratic power proxies;ultra compact power proxy;user-accessible parameters","","0","","10","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite of their quite simple working principles, they usually form rather complex mixed-signal blocks, particularly if digital correction and calibration are considered. As a result, pipeline converters are difficult to test and diagnose. In this paper, we propose to reconfigure the internal Multiplying DACs (MDACs) that perform residue amplifications as integrators, each one with an analog and a digital input. In this way, we can reuse consecutive pipeline stages to form ΣΔ modulators, with very reduced area overhead. We thus get an on-chip DC (low-frequency) probe with a digital 1-bit output that does not require any extra pin. In addition, digital test techniques developed for ΣΔ modulators may be used to enhance the diagnosing capabilities.

For applications such as cryptographic key generation, the PUF response bits must be highly reliable, consistent across multiple evaluations under voltage and temperature variations. Conventionally, error correcting codes (ECC) have been used to improve response reliability, but these techniques have significant area, power, and delay overheads and are vulnerable to information leakage. In this work, we present a highly-reliable, PUF-based, cryptographic key generator that uses no ECC, but instead uses built-in self-test to determine which PUF bits are reliable and only uses those bits for key generation. We implemented a prototype of the key generator in a 65nm bulk CMOS testchip. The key generator generates 1213 bits in an area of <;50k/μm<sup>2</sup> with a measured bit error rate of <; 5 <sub>*</sub> 10<sup>-9</sup> in both the nominal and worst case corners (100k measurements each). This is equivalent to a 128-bit key failure rate of <; 10<sup>-6</sup>. The system can generate a 128-bit key in 1.15μs.

However, while instruments provide valuable information and features to authorized users who need to harness them for test, debug, diagnosis, and possibly counterfeit detection, it may be desirable to restrict unauthorized access to certain instruments through the P1687 network. Previous work proposed replacing some of the segment insertion bits (SIBs), which add scan path segments in a P1687 network, with locking SIBs (LSIBs). LSIBs use the data that is naturally scanned through the network as keys to hide instruments from attackers. However, that previous work did not investigate many of the techniques and structures that can be used to significantly increase the time an attacker is likely to need to unlock LSIBs and gain access to hidden instruments.

However, circuit and system-level design techniques need to be explored that leaverage the specific spin-device characterisitcs to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nano-magnets can be exploited in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic.

Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultra-low-voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing. Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing hardware for applicatons like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing, image-processing and data-conversion.

Moving voltage regulators from off-chip to on-chip gains more and more interest in the power delivery system design, because it is able to provide fast voltage scaling and multiple power domains. Previous works are proposed to implement power efficient on-chip regulators. It is also important to analyze the characteristics of the entire power delivery system to explore the tradeoff between the promising properties and costs of employing on-chip regulators. In this work, we develop an analytical model to evaluate important characteristics of the power delivery system, including on-chip/off-chip voltage regulators and the passive on-chip/on-board parasitic. Compared with SPICE simulations, our model achieves a fast system-level evaluation with comparable accuracy. Based on the model, geometric programming is utilized to find the optimal power efficiency of different architectures of power delivery systems under constraints of output voltage stability and area. Experiments show that compared with the conventional architecture using off-chip regulators, the hybrid one using both on-chip and off-chip voltage regulators achieves 1.0% power efficiency improvement and 68% area reduction of voltage regulators on average. We conclude that the hybrid architecture has potential for high power efficiency and small area at heavy workload, but careful account for the overhead of on-chip regulators is needed.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800261","","Analytical models;Hybrid power systems;Inductors;Program processors;Regulators;System-on-chip;Voltage control","SPICE;integrated circuit design;logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;voltage regulators","SPICE simulations;geometric programming;many-core processor systems;off-chip voltage regulators;on-chip voltage regulators;passive on-chip/on-board parasitic;power delivery system design;power efficiency;power management","","1","","14","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, existing wideband-gap semiconductors, e.g., silicon carbide (SiC) transistor-based electronics have been considered most viable for high temperature and high radiation applications. However, the large-size, high threshold voltage, low switching speed and high leakage current make logic design with these devices unattractive. Additionally, the leakage current markedly increases at high temperature (in the range of 10 μA for a 2-input NAND gate), which induces self-heating effect and makes power delivery at high temperature very challenging. To address these issues, in this paper we present a computing platform for low-power reliable operation at extreme environment using SiC electromechanical switches.

We show that by relaxing the processing precision whenever possible, a VLSI implementation of an advanced wireless receiver algorithm based on opportunistic run-time approximations can save about 40% of the energy consumed by an optimized static implementation.

Based on this idea, a hardware system is proposed that is placed between the memory subsystem and the processing core of the design. The proposed system alters the conventional memory access pattern to progressively and adaptively access pixels from a target memory external to the system. The sampled pixels are used to reconstruct an approximation to the ground truth, which is stored in an internal image buffer for further processing. The system is prototyped on FPGA and its performance evaluation shows that a saving of up to 85% of memory accessing time and 33%/45% of image acquisition time/energy is achieved on the benchmark image “lena” while maintaining a PSNR of about 30 dB.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800569","","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Hardware;Image reconstruction;Memory management;PSNR;Random access memory","energy consumption;field programmable gate arrays;image sampling;integrated memory circuits;logic design","FPGA;PSNR;bandwidth requirement;digital images;energy consumption;hardware systems;image accessing process;image acquisition time/energy;image buffer;image processing;image progressive acquisition;image quality;image sampling;image/video processing systems;memory access pattern;memory subsystem;raw image data","","0","","13","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, function pipelines include hardware logic for dynamically inserting “bubbles” (pipeline stalls), which bring additional difficulties in equivalence checking.

Nowadays, multicore platforms are promoted due to cost and performance benefits. However, certification of multicore MC systems is challenging as concurrently executed applications of different criticalities may block each other when accessing shared platform resources. Most of the existing research on multicore MC scheduling ignores the effects of resource sharing on the response times of applications. Recently, a MC scheduling strategy was proposed, which explicitly accounts for these effects. This paper discusses how to combine this policy with an optimization method for the partitioning of tasks to cores as well as the static mapping of memory blocks, i.e., task data and communication buffers, to the banks of a shared memory architecture. Optimization is performed at design time targeting at minimizing the worst-case response times of tasks and achieving efficient resource utilization.

"Substituting transition faults with path delay faults as a basic delay fault model","Pomeranz, I.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

However, targeting a set of path delay faults is significantly more complex than targeting a set of transition faults when the goal is to consider the testable path delay faults that are associated with the longest paths. The reason is the large fraction of untestable path delay faults among these faults. This complication is removed if the requirement on the lengths of the paths is removed. In this case, it is possible to use path delay faults instead of transition faults as a basic delay fault model for better coverage of small delay defects. This paper studies the effects of using path delay faults as a basic delay fault model instead of transition faults.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800442","","Circuit faults;Computational modeling;Delays;Educational institutions;Integrated circuit modeling;Inverters;Merging","circuit testing;delay circuits;fault diagnosis","fraction;path delay fault tesing;single path delay fault model;single transition fault","","0","","13","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many regular NoC architectures have been proposed to eliminate the communication bottlenecks of traditional bus-based networks. Non-rectangular and irregular architectures have also been proposed to increase performance. However, the complexity of designing custom non-rectangular networks leads to a rapid increase in design and verification times. To alleviate the conflict between performance and efficiency, this paper proposes a novel method that efficiently constructs virtual non-rectangular topologies on a mesh network by using time-regulated models to emulate irregular patterns. Data routings on virtual hexagonal and two irregular geometries validate the proposed method. An MPEG-4 decoder is used to exemplify the proposed method for media applications. Results analysis shows the virtual topologies emulated by the proposed method can provide precise timing and energy performance.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800499","","Decoding;Geometry;Mesh networks;Network topology;Timing;Topology;Transform coding","codecs;logic design;network topology;network-on-chip","MPEG-4 decoder;bus-based networks;chip complexity;data routings;irregular NoC architectures;mesh network;networks-on-chips;nonrectangular NoC architectures;nonrectangular NoC topologies;on-chip communications;time-regulated models;virtual hexagonal geometries","","0","","15","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiple signoff corners, libraries, design methodologies, and implementation flows make timing closure very complex at advanced technology nodes. Design teams often wish to ensure that one tool's timing reports are neither optimistic nor pessimistic with respect to another tool's reports. The resulting “correlation” problem is highly complex because tools contain millions of lines of black-box and legacy code, licenses prevent any reverse-engineering of algorithms, and the nature of the problem is seemingly “unbounded” across possible designs, timing paths, and electrical parameters. In this work, we apply a “big-data” approach to the timer correlation problem. We develop a machine learning-based tool, Golden Timer eXtension (GTX), to correct divergence in flip-flop setup time, cell arc delay, wire delay, stage delay, and path slack at timing endpoints between timers. We propose a methodology to apply GTX to two arbitrary timers, and we evaluate scalability of GTX across multiple designs and foundry technologies / libraries, both with and without signal integrity analysis. Our experimental results show reduction in divergence between timing tools from 139.3ps to 21.1ps (i.e., 6.6×) in endpoint slack, and from 117ps to 23.8ps (4.9× reduction) in stage delay. We further demonstrate the incremental application of our methods so that models can be adapted to any outlier discrepancies when new designs are taped out in the same technology / library. Last, we demonstrate that GTX can also correlate timing reports between signoff and design implementation tools.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800474","","Delays;Integrated circuit modeling;Libraries;Silicon;Training;Wires","Big Data;delays;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence)","Big-Data approach;GTX;IC design flow;advanced technology nodes;cell arc delay;deep learning methodology;electrical parameters;endpoint slack;flip-flop setup time;foundry technology-libraries;golden signoff timing analysis;golden timer extension;machine learning-based tool;outlier discrepancies;path slack;signal integrity analysis;stage delay;time 139.3 ps to 21.1 ps;timer correlation problem;timing paths;wire delay","","0","","40","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method to compute a language-based guarantee which provides a more detailed description of the deadline miss patterns of an observed task. The only requirement of our method is that the timing behavior of the real-time system be modelled by a network of timed automata. We compute the language-based guarantee by constructing an equivalent finite state automaton in an iterative manner, using a counter-example guided procedure. We illustrate the language-based guarantee for two applications: design of a networked control system and scheduling in a mixed criticality system. In both cases, we show that the language-based guarantee leads to a more efficient design than the schedulability guarantee.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800401","","Automata;Computational modeling;Delays;Observers;Real-time systems;Uncertainty","formal verification;networked control systems;real-time systems;scheduling","cyber physical systems;deadline miss patterns;equivalent finite state automaton;language based guarantee;mixed criticality system;networked control system design;real time systems;timed automata;timing properties","","0","","17","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our platform uses multiple Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) with local and shared memories, and hardware accelerators (in the form of custom instructions). Our platform can be configured to use a particular number of ASIPs (slices per video frame) for a specific video resolution at design-time. The MPSoC architecture is automatically generated by our platform and the H.264 software does not need any modification, which enables quick design space exploration. We implemented the proposed platform in a commercial design environment, and illustrated its utility by creating systems with up to 170 ASIPs supporting resolutions up to HD1080.

Task mapping has shown significant promise as a low cost solution in achieving these objectives as standalone or in tandem as well. This paper proposes a multi-objective design space exploration to determine the mapping of tasks of an application on a multiprocessor system and voltage/frequency level of each tasks (exploiting the DVFS capabilities of modern processors) such that the reliability of the platform is improved while fulfilling the energy budget and the performance constraint set by system designers. In this respect, the reliability of a given MPSoC platform incorporates not only the impact of voltage and frequency on the aging of the processors (wear-out effect) but also on the susceptibility to soft-errors - a joint consideration missing in all existing works in this domain. Further, the proposed exploration also incorporates soft-error tolerance by selective replication of tasks, making the proposed approach an interesting blend of reactive and proactive fault-tolerance. The combined objective of minimizing core aging together with the susceptibility to transient faults under a given performance/energy budget is solved by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm exploiting tasks' mapping, DVFS and selective replication as tuning knobs.

Deciding on a suitable set of cache memories for an application specific embedded system's memory hierarchy is a tedious problem, particularly in the case of MPSoCs. To accurately determine the number of hits and misses for all the configurations in the design space of an MPSoC, researchers extract the trace first using Instruction set simulators and then simulate using a software simulator. Such simulations take several hours to months. We propose a novel method based on specialized hardware which can quickly simulate the design space of cache configurations for a shared memory multiprocessor system on an FPGA, by analyzing the memory traces and calculating the cache hits and misses simultaneously. We demonstrate that our simulator can explore the cache design space of a quad-core system with private L<sub>1</sub> caches and a shared L<sub>2</sub> cache, over a range of standard benchmarks, taking as less as 0.106 seconds per million memory accesses, which is up to 456 times faster than the fastest known software based simulator.

We present novel techniques for SN generation that lead to better accuracy/run-time trade-offs. First, we analyze a property called progressive precision (PP) which allows computational accuracy to grow systematically with run-time. Second, borrowing from Monte Carlo methods, we show that SC performance can be greatly improved by replacing the usual pseudo-random number sources by low-discrepancy (LD) sequences that are predictably progressive. Finally, we evaluate the use of LD stochastic numbers in SC, and show they can produce significantly faster and more accurate results than existing stochastic designs.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800290","Computer arithmetic;Monte Carlo methods;Stochastic computing;progressive precision","Accuracy;Clocks;Fluctuations;Image edge detection;Monte Carlo methods;Radiation detectors;Tin","Monte Carlo methods;integrated logic circuits;low-power electronics;random number generation;stochastic processes","Monte Carlo methods;arithmetic operations;design technique;image processing;low-discrepancy sequences;low-power circuitry;progressive precision;pseudo-random number;stochastic bit-streams;stochastic circuits;stochastic computing;stochastic numbers generation;ultra-small circuitry","","1","","11","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today's multicore workstations offer enormous computational power, but traditional simulation engines like the OSCI SystemC kernel only operate on a single thread, thereby leaving a lot of computational potential unused. Most modern embedded system designs include multiple processors. This work proposes SCope, a SystemC kernel that aims at exploiting the inherent parallelism of such systems by simulating the processors on different threads. A lookahead mechanism is employed to reduce the required synchronization between the simulation threads, thereby further increasing simulation speed.

However, traditional storage systems are designed and excessively optimized for magnetic disks, and the potential of flash memory is not brought into full play in the form of Solid State Drives (SSDs). In this paper, we propose p-OFTL, an object-based semantic-aware parallel flash translation layer (FTL). p-OFTL removes the mapping table in the FTL and directly manages the flash memory in file objects, which enables optimization of data layout in the flash using object semantics. While the removing of the mapping table improves system performance, a challenge remains to exploit the internal parallelism when maintaining the continuity of logical addresses in each object, which is essential for efficient garbage collection. To address this challenge, p-OFTL statically remaps the addresses by shifting the bits in the addresses, which spreads writes to different internal parallel units without another mapping table. Also, p-OFTL employs a semantic-aware data grouping algorithm to group data pages by trading off the hot-cold clustering for the continuity of logical addresses, so as to reduce the page movement in garbage collection. Experiments show that p-OFTL improves system performance by 4.0% ~ 10.3% and reduces garbage collection overhead by 15.1% ~ 32.5% in semantic-aware data grouping compared to those in semantic-unaware data grouping algorithms.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800371","","Ash;History;Layout;Optimization;Parallel processing;Semantics;Time-frequency analysis","flash memories;magnetic disc storage;parallel processing;storage management","SSDs;data layout optimization;data pages;flash memory;garbage collection;hot-cold clustering;internal parallel units;logical addresses;magnetic disks;mapping table;object-based semantic-aware parallel flash translation layer;p-OFTL;semantic-aware data grouping algorithm;semantic-unaware data grouping algorithms;solid state drives;storage systems","","0","","11","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But how many academic research results in computing technologies and EDA actually make it into industrial practice? In the context of the transition into the Horizon 2020 framework program, the European research community is currently investigating novel ways of stimulating additional academia-industry technology transfer. This special session contributes by discussing concrete transfer experiences and new concepts. Furthermore it will exemplify several success stories from both academic and industrial perspectives. We believe that two major issues currently prevent a wider industrial adoption of research results at European scale: • While most FP7 research projects do provide ambitious exploitation plans, these are rarely implemented to a full extent, because the effort for productization is underestimated and insufficient resources and incentives are available when projects fade out. • There is a lot of emphasis on start-up companies as a primary vehicle for technology transfer. However, the effort of start-up foundation is very high and might not be justified in many cases due to limited market volume. Instead, more focus should be on industrial take-up of specific new technologies or IP generated by research, which does not require large amounts of venture capital. As a consequence, European research needs better mechanisms to provide incentives for technology transfer at small to medium scale. The speakers of this session are experienced actors in this domain. They will point out in a pragmatic way, and using concrete examples, how technology transfer can be initiated and implemented in practice and what are the associated pitfalls and innovation opportunities. The mix of presentations ensures that both academic and industrial viewpoints and concerns are properly addressed. Thus, the se- sion will be of interest to a large audience. Amongst others, it is intended to stimulate more players to engage in international technology transfer. For this purpose, the session will be initiated by a brief presentation of a specific new pilot project (TETRACOM) focused on structured small to medium scale technology transfer. TETRACOM is open to the entire European computing research community and provides both funding and services for bilateral academia-industry collaborations.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800250","","","","","","0","","","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Authentication is one of the primary means to gain access to secure systems. Users need to be authenticated in order to gain access to the services and sensitive information contained within the system. Due to the surge in the number of touch based smart devices, there arises a need for a compatible authentication system. Historically, fingerprints have served in its fullest capacity to establish the uniqueness of an individual's identity. It can be detected using capacitive sensing techniques. In this paper we present a novel unified device using transparent electronics for both fingerprint scan and multi-touch interaction. We discuss a high resolution transparent touch sensitive device and a read out circuit that drives the capacitive sensor array for touch interactions at low resolutions and for fingerprint sensing at higher resolutions. Using circuit simulation and custom Verilog-A model for transparent thin-film transistors, we verified that our design can sense fingerprints in 8.25 ms and detect touches in 0.6ms with an efficient power consumption of 1 mW. The results show that such a device can be realized and can serve as a very efficient means of user authentication.

Multipliers are key arithmetic circuits in many such applications such as digital signal processing (DSP). In this paper, a novel approximate multiplier with a lower power consumption and a shorter critical path than traditional multipliers is proposed for high-performance DSP applications. This multiplier leverages a newly-designed approximate adder that limits its carry propagation to the nearest neighbors for fast partial product accumulation. Different levels of accuracy can be achieved through a configurable error recovery by using different numbers of most significant bits (MSBs) for error reduction. The approximate multiplier has a low mean error distance, i.e., most of the errors are not significant in magnitude. Compared to the Wallace multiplier, a 16-bit approximate multiplier implemented in a 28nm CMOS process shows a reduction in delay and power of 20% and up to 69%, respectively. It is shown that by utilizing an appropriate error recovery, the proposed approximate multiplier achieves similar processing accuracy as traditional exact multipliers but with significant improvements in power and performance.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800309","","Accuracy;Adders;Approximation methods;Delays;Logic gates;Vectors;Vegetation","CMOS integrated circuits;adders;digital signal processing chips;multiplying circuits;system recovery","CMOS process;DSP;MSB;approximate adder;approximate circuits;configurable error recovery;configurable partial error recovery;digital signal processing;error reduction;error-tolerant applications;high-performance approximate multiplier;low-power approximate multiplier;mean error distance;most significant bits;partial product accumulation;size 28 nm;word length 16 bit","","0","","10","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This unconventional class of materials is also the basis of a storage concept to replace flash memory. This talk will discuss the unique material properties which characterize phase change materials. In particular, it will be shown that the crystalline state of phase change materials is characterized by the occurrence of resonant bonding, a particular flavour of covalent bonding. This insight is employed to predict systematic property trends and to develop non-volatile memories with DRAM-like switching speeds potentially paving the road towards a universal memory.

We show how CNNs based on devices such as graphene transistors - with multiple steep current growth regions separated by negative differential resistance (NDR) in their I-V characteristics - could be used to recognize multiple patterns simultaneously. (This would require multiple steps given a conventional, binary CNN.) Also, we demonstrate how tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs) can be used to form circuits capable of performing similar tasks. With this approach, more “exotic” device I-V characteristics are not required - which should be an asset when considering issues such as cell-to-cell mismatch, etc. As a case study, we present a CNN-cell design that employs TFET-based circuitry to realize ternary outputs. We then illustrate how this hardware could be employed to efficiently solve a tactile sensing problem. The total number of computation steps as well as the required hardware could be reduced significantly when compared to an approach based on a conventional CNN.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800351","","Computer architecture;Graphene;Hardware;Performance evaluation;Resistance;Sensors;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;cellular neural nets;electronic engineering computing;field effect transistors;graphene;negative resistance;tunnel transistors","CMOS devices;I-V characteristics;NDR;TFETs;analog processor;binary CNN;cellular neural network;exotic device;graphene transistors;multiple steep current growth regions;negative differential resistance;nonbinary outputs;nonvon Neumann architectures;steep-slope transistors;tactile sensing problem;ternary outputs;tunneling field effect transistors","","3","","24","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We carry out accurate approximations of Schottky barrier tunneling, channel charge and current, which provide improved accuracy while maintaining compactness. This SPICE-compatible compact model surpasses the existing model [15] in accuracy, and enables efficient circuit-level simulations of futuristic GNRFET-based circuits. The proposed model considers various design parameters and process variation effects, including graphene-specific edge roughness, which allows complete and thorough exploration and evaluation of SB-GNRFET circuits. We are able to model both single- and double-gate SB-GNRFETs, so we can evaluate and compare these two types of SB-GNRFET. We also compare circuit-level performance of SB-GNRFETs with multi-gate (MG) Si-CMOS for a scalability study in future generation technology. Our circuit simulations indicate that SB-GNRFET has an energy-delay product (EDP) advantage over Si-CMOS; the EDP of the ideal SB-GNRFET (assuming no process variation) is ~1.3% of that of Si-CMOS, while the EDP of the non-ideal case with process variation is 136% of that of Si-CMOS.

Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are now becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for attacks, especially, malware infections. A number of approaches have been suggested to detect and/or mitigate such attacks. They vary greatly in terms of application generality and underlying assumptions. However, one common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device (prover). Many prior methods assume some form of trusted hardware on the prover, which is not a good option for small and low-end embedded devices. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of Remote Attestation without trusted hardware. This paper provides a systematic treatment of Remote Attestation, starting with a precise definition of the desired service and proceeding to its systematic deconstruction into necessary and sufficient properties. Next, these are mapped into a minimal collection of hardware and software components that result in secure Remote Attestation. One distinguishing feature of this line of research is the need to prove (or, at least argue for) architectural minimality - an aspect rarely encountered in security research. This work also provides a promising platform for attaining more advanced security services and guarantees.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800458","","Embedded systems;Hardware;Malware;Protocols;Read only memory","embedded systems;invasive software;trusted computing","application generality;architectural minimality;attack detection;attack mitigation;embedded computing devices;hardware components;low-end embedded devices;malware infections;minimalist approach;remote untrusted embedded device;secure remote attestation;security service;software components;trusted party","","2","","36","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the lack of accurate timing properties may prevent parallel execution from being applicable to time-critical applications. We illustrate how this problem has been addressed by suitably designing the architecture, implementation, and programming model, of the Kalray MPPA<sup>®</sup>-256 single-chip many-core processor. The MPPA<sup>®</sup> -256 (Multi-Purpose Processing Array) processor integrates 256 processing engine (PE) cores and 32 resource management (RM) cores on a single 28nm CMOS chip. These VLIW cores are distributed across 16 compute clusters and 4 I/O subsystems, each with a locally shared memory. On-chip communication and synchronization are supported by an explicitly addressed dual network-on-chip (NoC), with one node per compute cluster and 4 nodes per I/O subsystem. Off-chip interfaces include DDR, PCI and Ethernet, and a direct access to the NoC for low-latency processing of data streams. The key architectural features that support time-critical applications are timing compositional cores, independent memory banks inside the compute clusters, and the data NoC whose guaranteed services are determined by network calculus. The programming model provides communicators that effectively support distributed computing primitives such as remote writes, barrier synchronizations, active messages, and communication by sampling. POSIX time functions expose synchronous clocks inside compute clusters and mesosynchronous clocks across the MPPA<sup>®</sup>-256 processor.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800311","","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Programming;Registers;Time factors;Timing;VLIW","multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;parallel processing","CMOS chip;NoC;POSIX time functions;VLIW cores;distributed computing primitives;dual network-on-chip;high performance computing;key architectural features;low-latency processing;multipurpose processing array processor;processing engine cores;resource management cores;singlechip manycore processor;singlechip massively parallel processor;synchronous clocks;time-critical computing","","0","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in order to address the challenge of protecting the computation inside the microprocessor, we introduce a novel general purpose architecture for secure data processing, called HEROIC (Homomorphically EncRypted One Instruction Computer). This new design utilizes a single instruction architecture and provides native processing of encrypted data at the architecture level. The security of the solution is assured by a variant of Paillier's homomorphic encryption scheme, used to encrypt both instructions and data. Experimental results using our hardware-cognizant software simulator, indicate an average execution overhead between 5 and 45 times for the encrypted computation (depending on the security parameter), compared to the unencrypted variant, for a 16-bit single instruction architecture.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800460","Encrypted processor;Paillier;cloud computing;homomorphic encryption;one instruction set computer","Computers;Encryption;Memory management;Optimization","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy","HEROIC;Paillier's homomorphic encryption scheme;cloud computing;cloud microprocessors;data privacy;data processing security;encrypted computation;general purpose architecture;hardware-cognizant software simulator;homomorphically encrypted one instruction computer;security controls;single instruction architecture","","1","","19","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet many “generalpurpose GPU” (GPGPU) applications fail to fully utilize the GPU resources. Executing multiple applications simultaneously on different regions of the GPU (spatial multitasking) thus improves system performance. However, within-die process variations lead to significantly different maximum operating frequencies (F<sub>max</sub>) of the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) within a GPU. As the chip size and number of SMs per chip increase, the frequency variation is also expected to increase, exacerbating the problem. The increased number of SMs also provides a unique opportunity: we can allocate resources to concurrently-executing applications based on how those applications are affected by the different available F<sub>max</sub> values. In this paper, we study the effects of per-SM clocking on spatial multitasking-capable GPUs. We demonstrate two factors that affect the performance of simultaneously-running applications: (i) the SM partitioning algorithm that decides how many resources to assign to each application, and (ii) the assignment of SMs to applications based on the operating frequencies of those SMs and the applications characteristics. Our experimental results show that spatial multitasking that partitions SMs based on application characteristics, when combined with per-SM clocking, can greatly improve application performance by up to 46% on average compared to cooperative multitasking with global clocking.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800390","","Business process re-engineering;Clocks;Frequency control;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Multitasking;Partitioning algorithms","graphics processing units;high level languages;multiprogramming","GPU;graphics processing units;high level programming languages;maximum operating frequencies;process variation aware workload partitioning algorithms;spatial multitasking;streaming multiprocessors;within die process variations","","0","","20","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach operates at the logic level and takes into account the input and output interface specifications of the circuit.

Madras, Chennai, India","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","6","A single parallel application running on a multi-core system shows sub-linear speedup because of slow progress of one or more threads known as critical threads. Some of the reasons for the slow progress of threads are (1) load imbalance, (2) frequent cache misses and (3) effect of synchronization primitives. Identifying critical threads and minimizing their cache miss latencies can improve the overall execution time of a program. One way to hide and tolerate the cache misses is through hardware prefetching. Hardware prefetching is one of the most commonly used memory latency hiding techniques. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of hardware prefetchers for multiprogrammed workloads (multiple sequential applications running independently on different cores). In contrast to multiprogrammed workloads, the performance of a single parallel application depends on the progress of slow progress(critical) threads. This paper introduces a prefetcher aggressiveness control mechanism called Thread Criticality-aware Prefetcher Aggressiveness Control (TCPAC). TCPAC controls the aggressiveness of the prefetchers at the L2 prefetching controllers (known as TCPAC-P), DRAM controller (known as TCPAC-D) and at the Last Level Cache (LLC) controller (known as TCPAC-C) using prefetch accuracy and thread progress. Each TCPAC sub-technique outperforms the respective state-of-the-art techniques such as HPAC [2], PADC [4], and PACMan [3] and the combination of all the TCPAC sub-techniques named as TCPAC-PDC outperforms the combination of HPAC, PADC, and PACMan. On an average, on a 8 core system, in terms of improvement in execution time, TCPAC-PDC outperforms the combination of HPAC, PADC, and PACMan by 7.61%.

Moreover, GPU architecture has also been used for general purpose computing in these days. Most of the current scheduling frameworks that are developed to handle GPGPU workload operate sequentially. This is problematic since this sequential approach may not be scalable for real-time systems, which is a consequence of the approach's inability to support preemption. We propose a novel scheduling framework that provides real-time support for the GPGPU platform. In contrast to existing frameworks, our proposed framework considers both concurrent execution of applications on the GPU and mapping between streaming multiprocessors and thread blocks. By considering both concurrent execution and mapping, our framework is able to guarantee timing up to 6.4 times as many applications compared to TimeGraph [9] and Global EDF [5].

This work proposes a novel flip-flop architecture named SETTOFF which significantly improves circuit resilience to radiation hits over previous techniques. In addition, compared to other techniques such as a TMR latch, SETTOFF reduces the area and performance overheads by up to 50% and 80%, respectively; the power consumption overhead is also reduced by up to 85%. In addition, a novel reliability metric called radiation-induced failure rate is developed which can be a valuable tool to predict the impact of radiation hits and quantitatively compare the reliability of various radiation hardened techniques.

Specifically, we address the long latency of the write operation in PCM - attributed to PCM SET - by proposing a novel PCM memory architecture that integrates WOM-codes at the memory organization and memory controller levels. The proposed <;2<sup>2</sup>><sup>2</sup>/3 WOM-code PCM architecture is able to reduce memory write (read) latency by 20.1% (10.2%) on average across general-purpose (SPEC CPU2006), embedded (MiBench), and high-performance (SPLASH-2) benchmarks. To further improve the write latency of WOM-code PCM, we propose a PCM-refresh approach that uses idle cycles to preemptively set PCM rows to the initial WOM-code state. Results show that WOM-code PCM with PCM-refresh can reduce memory write (read) latency by 54.9% (47.9%) on average across the benchmarks. Finally, to balance write latency improvements against WOM-code PCM overhead, we propose a WOM-code cached PCM (WCPCM) architecture that uses WOM-code PCM as the cache alongside conventional PCM main memory. For just 4.7% memory overhead, WCPCM reduces memory write (read) latency by 47.2% (44.0%) on average across the benchmarks.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800395","","Arrays;Memory architecture;Memory management;Microprocessors;Phase change materials","phase change memories;random-access storage;write-once storage","MiBench benchmarks;PCM SET;SPEC CPU2006;SPLASH-2 benchmarks;WCPCM architecture;WOM-code PCM;WOM-code cached PCM architecture;embedded benchmarks;high-performance benchmarks;memory controller levels;memory write latency;next-generation nonvolatile memory applications;phase change memory;read latency;write-once-memory-code","","0","","38","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Programmers can rarely anticipate all possible external and internal interactions in complex concurrent systems. Concurrency bugs originating from races and improper synchronization are difficult to understand and reproduce. Furthermore, traditional debug and verification practices for embedded systems lack support to address this issue efficiently. For instance, programmers still need to step through several executions until finding a buggy state or analyze complex traces, which results in productivity losses. This paper proposes a new debug approach for MPSoCs that combines dynamic analysis and the benefits of virtual platforms. All in all, it (i) enables automatic exploration of SW behavior, (ii) identifies problematic concurrent interactions, (iii) provokes possibly erroneous executions and, ultimately, (iv) detects concurrency bugs.

Due to the physical nature of light-wave systems and their usage in safety critical domains such as human surgeries and high budget space missions, it is indispensable to build high assurance systems. Traditionally, the analysis of such systems has been carried out by paper-and-pencil based proofs and numerical computations. However, these techniques cannot provide perfectly accurate results due to the risk of human error and inherent approximations of numerical algorithms. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose to use higher-order logic theorem proving to improve the analysis in the domain of integrated optics or VLSI photonics. In particular, this paper provides a higher-order logic formalization of optical microresonators which are the most fundamental building blocks of many photonic devices.

The dual-rail checker utilizes two XOR gates each made of 2 inverters and 2 ambipolar transistors, hence, it has a hybrid nature. Extensive simulation results are provided.

First, we study the behavior and structure of several S-box implementations, to understand the causes behind the fault sensitivity. We identify two factors: the timing of fault sensitive paths, and the number of logic levels of fault sensitive gates within the netlist. Next, we propose a systematic countermeasure against FSA. The countermeasure masks the effect of these factors by intelligent insertion of delay elements. We evaluate our methodology by means of an FPGA prototype with built-in timing-measurement. We show that FSA can be thwarted at low hardware overhead. Compared to earlier work, our method operates at the logic-level, is systematic, and can be easily generalized to bigger circuits.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800418","Data Dependency;FPGA;Fault Sensitivity Analysis;On-chip time measurement;S-box","Circuit faults;Cryptography;Delays;Hamming weight;Logic gates;Sensitivity","cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;logic gates;sensitivity analysis","AES S-box architectures;FPGA prototype;FSA;built-in timing-measurement;delay elements;fault sensitive gates;fault sensitive paths;fault sensitivity analysis;intelligent insertion;logic levels;side-channel attack;systematic countermeasure","","0","","19","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, merely metal based NoC pursuit offers limited scalability with the relentless technology scaling, especially in one-to-many (1-to-M) communication. To meet the scalability demand, this paper proposes a new hybrid architecture empowered by both metal interconnects and Zenneck surface wave interconnects (SWI). This architecture, in conjunction with newly proposed routing and global arbitration schemes, avoids overloading the NoC and alleviates traffic hotspots compared to the trend of handling 1-to-M traffic as unicast. This work addresses the system level challenges for intra chip multicasting. Evaluation results, based on a cycle-accurate simulation and hardware description, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of power reduction ratio of 4 to 12X and average delay reduction of 25X or more, compared to a regular NoC. These results are achieved with negligible hardware overheads.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800488","","Computer architecture;Integrated circuit interconnections;Optical surface waves;Protocols;Surface impedance;Surface waves;System-on-chip","integrated circuit interconnections;multicast communication;network-on-chip","hybrid wire surface wave architecture;intra chip multicasting;networks on chip;one to many communication;surface wave interconnects","","1","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One such problem is known as Pauli tracking. Methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are compatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum teleportation protocols. These protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and result in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation. These byproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself, but are tracked through the circuit and output results reinterpreted. This tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it is assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed. In this work we help fill this gap and present an algorithm for tracking byproduct operators through a quantum computation.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800338","","Computers;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Logic gates;Quantum computing;Rotation measurement;Teleportation","error correction codes;fault tolerant computing;quantum gates","error correction technology;fault tolerant quantum circuits;large scale quantum computing;quantum algorithms;quantum teleportation protocols;software based Pauli tracking","","0","","21","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For Poisson distribution of inter-arrival times and Gaussian distribution of execution demand of jobs, COOLIP matches the 95-percentile response time of Earliest Finish-Time (EFT) policy which minimizes response time with full knowledge of execution demand of unfinished jobs and thermal models of processors.

The proposed technique has been validated through experiments using two ASICs in 65nm CMOS, one with an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller and one with a Cortex-A5 microprocessor. Silicon measurement results verify the viability of the technique for embedded processors. Furthermore, the proposed clock modulation technique demonstrates a significant area reduction, without compromising the detection performance.

However, one of the difficulties is the limited write endurance of most non-volatile memory technologies. In this paper, we propose to exploit the narrow-width values to improve the lifetime of non-volatile last level caches. Leading zeros masking scheme is first proposed to reduce the write stress to the upper half of the narrow-width data. To balance the write variations between the upper half and the lower half of the narrow-width data, two swap schemes, the swap on write (SW) and swap on replacement (SRepl), are proposed. To further reduce the write stress to non-volatile caches, we adopt two optimization schemes, the multiple dirty bit (MDB) and read before write (RBW), to improve their lifetime. Our experimental results show that by combining all our proposed schemes, the lifetime of non-volatile caches can be improved by 245% on average.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800266","","Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Nonvolatile memory;Optimization;Random access memory;Stress;System-on-chip","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;cache storage;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics","DRAM;SRAM;leading zeros masking scheme;low leakage power consumption;multiple dirty bit;narrow-width values;nonvolatile cache lifetime;optimization schemes;read before write","","0","","16","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these approaches often target various application domains and address error detection and correction at different granularities and with different overheads, an emerging trend is the use of state compression, e.g., cyclic redundancy check (CRC), to reduce the cost of redundancy checking. Prior work in the literature has shown that Fletcher's checksum (FC), while less effective where error detection probability is concerned, is less computationally complex when implemented in software than the more-effective CRC. In this paper, we reexamine the suitability of CRC and FC as compression algorithms when implemented in hardware for embedded safety-critical systems. We have developed and evaluated parameterizable implementations of CRC and FC in FPGA, and we observe that what was true for software implementations does not hold in hardware: CRC is more efficient than FC across a wide variety of target input bandwidths and compression strengths.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800307","","Clocks;Hardware;Pipeline processing;Polynomials;Redundancy;Registers;Throughput","cyclic redundancy check codes;error correction codes;error detection codes;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips;radiation hardening (electronics);transistor circuits","FPGA;Fletcher's checksum;computationally complex;cyclic redundancy check;embedded safety-critical systems;error correction computer systems;error detection computer systems;error detection probability;execution signature compression;microarchitectural strategies;processor systems;redundancy checking;semiconductor processes scale;state compression;system-level strategies;transient upset;transistors","","0","","41","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is a modification of the Index-aware model order reduction (IMOR) method proposed in our earlier papers which is the explicit-IMOR method. It also involves first splitting the differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) into differential and algebraic parts using a basis of projectors. In contrast with the explicit-IMOR method, the implicit-IMOR method leads to implicit differential and algebraic parts. We demonstrate the implicit-IMOR method using the RLC/RC networks, but it can also be applied to other problems which lead to differential-algebraic equations.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800257","","Computational modeling;Equations;Indexes;Mathematical model;Power systems;Reduced order systems;Transfer functions","RC circuits;RLC circuits;differential algebraic equations;network analysis;reduced order systems","DAE;RC networks;RLC networks;differential algebraic equations;explicit-IMOR method;implicit index-aware model order reduction;implicit-IMOR","","0","","14","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Partial-SET: Write speedup of PCM main memory","Bing Li; ShuChang Shan; Yu Hu; Xiaowei Li","Key Lab. of Comput. Syst. & Archit., Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE), 2014","20140421","2014","","","1","4","Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising nonvolatile memory technology developed as a possible DRAM replacement. Although it offers the read latency close to that of DRAM, PCM generally suffers from the long write latency. Long write request may block the read requests on the critical path of cache/memory access, incurring adverse impact on the system performance. Besides, the write performance of PCM is very asymmetric, i.e, the SET operation (writing `1') is much slower than that of the RESET operation (writing `0'). In this work, we re-examine the resistance transform process during the SET operation of PCM and propose a novel Partial-SET scheme to alleviate the long write latency issue of PCM. During a write access to a memory line, a short Partial-SET pulse is applied first to program the PCM cells to a pre-stable state, achieving the same write latency as RESET. The partially-SET cells are then fully programmed within the retention window to preserve the data integrity. Experimental results show that our Partial-SET scheme can improve the memory access performance of PCM by more than 45% averagely with very marginal storage overhead.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800267","","Acceleration;Memory management;Phase change materials;Phase change memory;Random access memory;Reliability;Resistance","cache storage;phase change memories","DRAM replacement;PCM main memory;RESET operation;SET operation;adverse impact;cache-memory access;data integrity;marginal storage overhead;memory line;nonvolatile memory technology;partial-SET scheme;partially-SET cells;phase change memory;read latency;read request;resistance transform process;retention window;short-partial-SET pulse;write access;write latency;write performance;write request;write speedup","","1","","23","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In both cases, the lifetime of sensor nodes included in the BAN is a key aspect that may affect the functionality of the whole system. Typical approaches to power management are based on a trade-off between the data rate and the monitoring time. Our work introduces a power management layer capable to opportunistically use data sampled by sensors to detect contextual information such as user activity and adapt the node operating point accordingly. The use of this layer has been demonstrated on a commercial sensor node, increasing its battery lifetime up to a factor of 5.","","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800384","body area networks;context-awareness;healthcare applications;power management","Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Complexity theory;Context;Monitoring;Power demand;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical electronics;body area networks;body sensor networks;health care;medical signal processing;motion measurement;patient monitoring;user interfaces","battery lifetime;commercial sensor node;context aware power management;contextual information detection;data rate;data sampling;fitness purposes;healthcare;monitoring time;motion-sensing body area network nodes;node operating point;power management layer;sensor node lifetime;user activity","","1","","23","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
