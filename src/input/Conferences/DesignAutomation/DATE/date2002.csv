As System-on-Chip (SoC) designs include analog components in most cases, these analog parts become even more a bottleneck in the overall design process. The paper is dedicated to latest R&D activities within the MEDEA+ project ANASTASIA+. Main focus will be the development of seamless top-down design methods for integrated analog and mixed-signal systems and to achieve a high level of automation and reuse in the A/MS design process. These efforts are motivated by the urgent need to close the current gap in the industrial design flow between system specification and design on the one hand and block-level circuit design on the other hand. The paper will focus on three subtopics starting with the top-down design flow with applications from circuit sizing, design centering, and automated behavioral modeling. The next part focuses on modeling and simulation of specific functionalities in sigma-delta design while the last section is dedicated to a mixed-signal System-on-Chip design environment","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998405","","Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Design automation;Design methodology;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Mathematical model;Process design;SPICE;System-on-a-chip","analogue integrated circuits;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;sigma-delta modulation","ANASTASIA+;analog IC;automated behavioral modeling;block-level circuit design;circuit sizing;design centering;design reuse;electronic design automation;industrial design flow;layout generation;mixed-signal IC;sigma-delta modulator;system specification;system-on-chip;top-down design","","6","2","27","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to model interconnect, how to handle degradation of signal integrity and increasing power density are changing now, and have led to integrating logic and layout synthesis. Aggressive gate sizing to control timing has become part of any modern back-end. From 0.13 Î¼ and down, chips will be more susceptive to breakdown during fabrication (antenna effect) or to wear out over time (electromigration) and dealing with these issues will require careful planning. More integration of fast and accurate analysis with a complete design flow (chip planning, synthesis, placement and routing) will be needed, and still, advancing complexity will affect design and verification. Using hundreds of millions of devices effectively will be possible only by reusing pre-designed intellectual property (IP) effectively and by addressing system-level issues in EDA.

By presenting a new design flow and using the fault simulation in a very early design stage, a tool-suite is developed. It allows one to control the defect-robust layout and to eliminate those faults that limit the efficiency of a measurement system. This allows for economic self-test applications.

A hierarchical test manager (HTM) is proposed to generate the control signals for these cores, taking into account the IEEE P1500 Standard proposal. A standard memory BIST interface is also presented, linking the HTM and the memory BIST circuit. It can control the BIST circuit with the serial or parallel test access mechanism.

The combined effects of devices increased complexity and reduced design cycle time creates a testing problem: an increasing larger portion of the design time is devoted to testing and verification. Today EDA tools, moving towards higher levels of abstraction, promise greater designer productivity, resulting in increased design complexity and size. In order to reduce the testing and verification time, different high-level approaches have been proposed in literature. Most of these approaches are based on the definition of an error or fault model, applicable at a higher level of abstraction of the description of the system to be implemented. In this paper we concentrate our attention on the evaluation of error models, used in test generation and in functional verification.

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","1122","","Summary form only given. Weighted pseudorandom test generation (WPRTG) uses test sequences characterized by non-uniform distributions of test vectors in order to increase the detection probability of random resistant faults. Such non-uniform distributions are characterized by the values of signal probability of the CUT inputs (weights). Since different faults may require different distributions, a (small) number of distributions is typically used. The weights of such distributions are identified by analyzing the CUT The corresponding pseudorandom sequences are typically obtained by inserting a combinational network between the TPG and the CUT. Differently from the genetic-based approaches, where only numerical coefficients are computed, we have used an evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm that directly evolves the WGU network. In fact, evolutionary approaches have been shown to be effective in the design of digital circuits. In particular, we evolve a population were each individual represents a possible WGU and the fitness function considers the fault coverage as a primary target and the test length and the cost of the WGU as secondary ones. The fault coverage is evaluated here by means of fault simulation","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998478","","Character generation;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computer networks;Cost function;Digital circuits;Fault detection;Genetic programming;Random sequences","automatic test pattern generation;built-in self test;combinational circuits;evolutionary computation;fault simulation;integrated circuit testing;logic design;logic testing","ATPG;BIST;CUT inputs;WGU network;combinational network;detection probability;digital circuits;evolutionary programming algorithm;fault coverage;fault simulation;fitness function;on-chip pseudorandom TPG;pseudorandom test pattern generators;random resistant faults;signal probability;test sequence optimisation;test vectors nonuniform distributions;weighted pseudorandom test generation","","2","","3","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based on analyzing the factors that influence test parameters: compression ratio, area overhead and test application time. To improve compression ratio, the new method is based on a variable-length input Huffman coding (VIHC), which fully exploits the type and length of the patterns, as well as a novel mapping and reordering algorithm proposed in a pre-processing step. The new VIHC algorithm is combined with a novel parallel on-chip decoder that simultaneously leads to low test application time and low area overhead. It is shown that, unlike three previous approaches which reduce some test parameters at the expense of the others, the proposed method is capable of improving all the three parameters simultaneously.

Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 2002. Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","1123","","Summary form only given. Design methodologies for large designs produce circuits that consist of interconnections of functional blocks. If the blocks are large, as in core-based designs, they may be isolated for testing purposes (e.g., by test wrappers) such that different blocks can be tested independently. However, even if a test wrapper exists, it is advantageous to test functional paths that go through two or more blocks by using test vectors that propagate fault effects through several blocks. This contributes to testing of defects that cannot be detected if each block is tested separately. One of the issues that arises when several blocks are tested by the same test is that of fault isolation. If a test that propagates fault effects through blocks C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> produces a faulty response on the outputs of C<sub>2</sub>, the goal of fault isolation is to identify which one of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> is faulty. Fault isolation is perfect if every faulty response on the outputs of the circuit can be uniquely attributed to a single block. This happens when every pair of faults belonging to different blocks is distinguishable. If faults of different blocks remain undistinguished, fault isolation is not possible when responses equal to the responses produced by these faults are produced by the circuit-under-test. It may appear that tests for several non-isolated blocks will not be able to isolate faults. In this work, we study this issue and demonstrate that perfect or close-to-perfect fault isolation is possible with tests that propagate fault effects through several blocks","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998479","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Design methodology;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Integrated circuit interconnections","fault diagnosis;logic testing","circuit-under-test;core-based designs;fault isolation;functional blocks;nonisolated blocks;test vectors","","0","","","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This eliminates the need of added global paths as in the conventional oscillation test scheme. For diagnosis, the scheme transforms the circuit into a Schmitt trigger type of circuit with a positive-feedback. The output of the circuit under an applied triangular input gives signatures which are used to identify faults.

We show that such test sets may not detect faults associated with the next-to-longest paths. This may lead to undetected failures since shorter paths may fail without any of the longest paths failing. In addition, paths that appear to be shorter may actually be longer than the longest paths if the procedure used for estimating path length is inaccurate. We propose a test enrichment procedure that increases significantly the number of faults associated with the next-to-longest paths that are detected by a (compact) test set. This is achieved by allowing the underlying test generation procedure the flexibility of detecting or not detecting the faults associated with the next-to-longest paths.

Component wrappers use split-level interfaces that implement the composition rules, dynamic type determination and type inference algorithms. Using an interface description language compiler automatically generates the split-level interfaces.

The on-the-fly swapping between those implementations requires extra time to save and/or transform states of a certain task implementation. Even if the two steady-state schedules before and after the swapping are feasible, the transient schedule with the additional swapping computation time may exceed the system's capacity. Our technique is an extension to rate monotonic scheduling (RMS). While maintaining and meeting performance requirements, our technique shows an average reduction of 31% in power consumption compared to systems using a pure static scheduling approach (RMS) that cannot make use of task swapping.

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","672","676","We present a novel algorithm that applies physical layout information during common subexpression extraction to improve wiring congestion and delay, resulting in improved design closure. As feature sizes decrease and chip sizes increase, the traditional separation of physical design and logic synthesis proves to be increasingly detrimental. Interconnect delay and wiring congestion, among the most critical objective functions to meet design closure, are not considered during logic synthesis. On the other hand, physical design is too deep in the design process to be able to significantly restructure the already technology mapped netlist. While this problem has been addressed previously, the existing solutions only apply simple synthesis transforms during physical design. Hence they are generally unable to reverse decisions made during logic restructuring which have a major negative impact on the circuit structure. In our novel approach, we propose a layout driven algorithm for the concurrent extraction of common subexpressions, one of the most important steps that affect the overall circuit structure, and consequently congestion and wire length during logic synthesis. In addition, we consider dependency relations between cube divisors to improve the extraction process. As a result, our layout driven decomposition algorithm combines logic synthesis and physical layout information to effectively decrease wire length and improve congestion for improved design closure","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998371","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Data mining;Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Logic design;Process design;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;delay estimation;integrated circuit interconnections;logic CAD","algorithm;delay;feature sizes;interconnect delay;layout driven algorithm;layout driven decomposition;logic restructuring;logic synthesis;physical layout;subexpression extraction;wiring congestion","","6","","11","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This extends recent work on exact methods for wrapper/TAM co-optimization based on integer linear programming and exhaustive enumeration. We show that the SOC testing times obtained using the new heuristic algorithm are comparable to the testing times obtained using exact methods.

However, for technologies of 0.25 Î¼m and below, the wiring capacitance dominates the gate capacitance and the delay estimation based on fanout and design legacy statistics can be highly inaccurate. In addition, logic block size is no longer dictated solely by total cell area, and is often limited by wiring area resources.

On a hit in the decode filter cache, fetching from the instruction cache and the subsequent decoding is eliminated, which results in power savings in both instruction fetch and instruction decode. We propose to classify instructions into cacheable or uncacheable depending on the decoded width. Then sectored cache design is used in the decode filter cache so that cacheable and uncacheable instructions can coexist in a decode filter cache sector. Finally, a prediction mechanism is presented to reduce the decode filter cache miss penalty. Experimental results show average 34% processor power reduction and less than 1% performance degradation.","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998311","","Automatic testing;Clocks;Computer science;Decoding;Degradation;Design automation;Digital-to-frequency converters;Europe;Filters;Power dissipation","cache storage;computer architecture;decoding;embedded systems;microprocessor chips","CPU core;cacheable instructions;decode filter cache;decode filter cache miss penalty;decoded instruction stream;embedded processor power saving;instruction cache;instruction decode;instruction fetch;instruction filter cache;instruction stream servicing;processor performance degradation;processor power consumption;processor power reduction;sectored cache design;uncacheable instructions","","16","","14","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","382","386","We present a new scan-BIST approach for determining failing vectors for fault diagnosis. This approach is based on the application of overlapping intervals of test vectors to the circuit under test. Two MISRs (multiple-input signature registers) are used in an interleaved fashion to generate intermediate signatures, thereby obviating the need for multiple test sessions. The knowledge of failing and non-failing intervals is used to obtain a set S of candidate failing vectors that includes all the actual (true) failing vectors. We present analytical results to determine an appropriate interval length and the degree of overlap, an upper bound on the size of S, and a lower bound on the number of true failing vectors; the latter depends only on the knowledge of failing and non-failing intervals. Finally, we describe two pruning procedures that allow us to reduce the size of S, while retaining most true failing vectors in S. We present experimental results for the ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scan-BIST diagnosis approach.","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998302","","Application software;Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Circuit testing;Computer science;Failure analysis;Fault diagnosis;Identity-based encryption;Registers;Test pattern generators","automatic test pattern generation;automatic testing;built-in self test;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;vectors","ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits;built-in self-test;candidate failing vectors;interleaved MISR;intermediate signatures;interval length;multiple-input signature registers;pruning procedures;scan-BIST interval-based fault diagnosis;test vector overlapping intervals;true failing vector identification","","7","","17","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the concurrency alignment in most modeling frameworks is naturally expressed along hardware units, being supported by the various language constructs, and the system designers express concurrency in their system models by providing threads for some modules/units of the model. Our experimental analysis shows that this concurrency model leads to inefficient simulation performance, and a concurrency alignment along dataflow gives much better simulation performance, but changes the conceptual model of hardware structures. As a result, we propose an algorithmic transformation of designs written in these C++-based environments with concurrency alignment along units/modules. This transformation, provided as a compiler front-end, will re-assign the concurrency along the dataflow, as opposed to threading along concurrent hardware/software modules, keeping the functionality of the model unchanged. Such a front-end transformation strategy will relieve hardware system designers from concerns about software engineering issues such as, threading architecture, and simulation performance, while allowing them to design in the most natural manner whereas, the simulation performance can be enhanced up to almost two times as shown in our experiments","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998404","","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Kernel;Performance analysis;Power system modeling;Software engineering;Yarn","C++ language;concurrency theory;data flow computing;high level synthesis;multi-threading","C++ language;compiler front-end transformation;concurrency re-assignment algorithm;data flow;hardware/software module;high-level system model;reactivity;simulation kernel;system design;system-level simulation;threading architecture","","5","","18","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, this logic requires chip area and energy. A scratchpad memory is much more energy efficient, but there is a need for software control of its content.

This future, however, requires compilers that can reduce code size by compiling for both Instruction Sets. Existing compiler techniques operate at the function-level granularity and are unable to make the trade-off between increased register pressure (resulting in more spills) and decreased code size.

Currently, in a long series-connected FET chain, the dimensions of the transistors are decreased from bottom transistor to the top transistor in a manner where the width of transistors is tapered linearly or exponentially. However, it has not been mathematically proved whether either of these tapering schemes yields optimal results in terms of minimization of switching delays of the network. In this paper, we rigorously analyze MOS circuits consisting of long FET chains under the widely used Elmore delay model and derive the optimality of transistor tapering by employing variational calculus. Specifically, we demonstrate that neither linear nor exponential tapering alone minimizes the discharge time of the FET chain. Instead, a composition of exponential and constant tapering actually optimizes the delay of the network.

This heterogeneity poses a challenge to embedded system design methodologies, and has resulted in a search for a System Level Design Language (SLDL) for describing both software and hardware. We believe that to obtain a good SLDL one needs to first understand what the combination of models of computation means. To this end we are developing a kernel language in which it is possible to use different models of computation. The main contributions of this work are: (1) a common set of concepts that form the basis of the kernel language, (2) a formally defined operational semantics, which also makes it possible to verify designs using e.g. model-checking, (3) the explicit use of atomicity and, (4) the introduction of the notion of execution policy","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998494","","Automata;Computational modeling;Embedded system;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Multimedia systems;Protocols;Radio frequency;Signal design;Signal processing","embedded systems;specification languages","System Level Design Language;embedded system design;heterogenous computing;kernel language","","0","","4","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques, starting from a series of measurements carried out on a previously selected test point set, given the circuit topology and the nominal values of the components, are aimed at determining the effective values of the circuit parameters by solving a set of equations nonlinear with respect to the component values. Here the role of symbolic techniques in the automation of parametric fault diagnosis of analog circuits is investigated.

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","1092","","Summary form only given. Cache memories are known to consume a large percentage of on-chip energy in current microprocessors. Direct-mapped caches are, in general, more energy efficient as they are simpler as compared to set-associative caches, and require no complex line replacement mechanisms. This study goes beyond performance-centric techniques, and proposes an energy-oriented optimization strategy that aims directly at reducing per access energy cost for direct-mapped data caches (rather than as a side effect of a performance-oriented optimization). Specifically, we have developed a compiler algorithm that uses access pattern analysis to determine those memory references that are certain to result in cache hits in a virtually-addressed direct-mapped data cache. After detecting such references, the compiler substitutes the corresponding load operations with energy-efficient loads that access only the data array of the cache instead of both tag and data arrays.

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","964","970","We have developed a technique to compute a Quasi Static Schedule of a concurrent specification for the software partition of an embedded system. Previous work did not take into account correlations among run-time values of variables, and therefore tried to find a schedule for all possible outcomes of conditional expressions. This is advantageous on one hand, because by abstracting data values one can find schedules in many cases for an originally undecidable problem. On the other hand it may lead to exploring false paths, i.e., paths that can never happen at run-time due to constraints on how the variables are updated. This affects the applicability of the approach, because it leads to an explosion in the running time and the memory requirements of the compile-time scheduler itself. Even worse, it also leads to an increase in the final code size of the generated software. In this paper we propose a semi-automatic algorithm to solve the problem of false paths: the designer identifies and tags critical expressions, and synchronization channels are automatically added to the specification to drive the search of a schedule","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998416","","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system control;Concurrent computing;Consumer electronics;Driver circuits;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Runtime","data flow computing;embedded systems;formal specification;processor scheduling;sequential machines;synchronisation","applicability;code size;compile-time scheduler;concurrent specification;critical expressions;embedded system;false path elimination;quasi-static scheduling;run-time values;running time;semi-automatic algorithm;software partition;synchronization channels","","1","1","11","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to high accuracy of the global approximation, the extracted poles can accurately represent the exact admittance matrices in a wide frequency range. By using the recursive convolution technique, the pole-residue models can be represented by companion models, which have linear complexity with respect to the computational time.

In this paper we tackle the analysis of global resource sharing, scheduling, and buffer sizing in heterogeneous embedded systems. For many practically used preemptive and non-preemptive hardware and software scheduling algorithms of processors and busses, semi-formal analysis techniques are known. However they cannot be used in system level analysis due to incompatibilities of their underlying event models.

In this paper we introduce a novel intra-task DVS technique under compiler control using program checkpoints. Checkpoints are generated at compile time and indicate places in the code where the processor speed and voltage should be re-calculated. Checkpoints also carry user-defined time constraints. Our technique handles multiple intra-task performance deadlines and modulates power consumption according to a run-time power budget. We experimented with two heuristics for adjusting the clock frequency and voltage. For the particular benchmark studied, one heuristic yielded 63% more energy savings than the other. With the best of the heuristics we designed, our technique resulted in 82% energy savings over the execution of the program without employing DVS","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998266","","Control systems;Degradation;Dynamic scheduling;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Operating systems;Program processors;Scheduling algorithm;Time factors;Voltage control","CMOS digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;logic simulation;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling;program compilers","CMOS circuit delay;CPU energy consumption;compiler control;intra-task DVS technique;multiple intra-task performance deadlines;power consumption;processor speed;processor voltage;profile-based dynamic voltage scheduling;program checkpoints;run-time power budget","","34","2","25","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A method is presented that allows for the generation of guaranteed passive rational function models of passive systems by approximating their scattering parameter matrices. Since the order of the models may in some cases be high, an incremental fitting strategy is also proposed that allows for the generation of smaller models while still meeting the required passivity and accuracy requirements.

But in today's high-density VLSI layouts, there is simply not enough room for ""under-the-wire"" diode insertion for all wires. Thus it is necessary to insert many diodes at legal ""off-wire"" locations and extend the antenna-rule violating wires to connect to their respective diodes. Previously only simple heuristic algorithms were available for this diode insertion and routing problem. In this paper we show that the diode insertion and routing problem for an arbitrary given number of routing layers can be optimally solved in polynomial time. Our algorithm guarantees to find a feasible diode insertion and routing solution whenever one exists.

Our approach leverages the system architect's knowledge about the behavior of the pipelined processor through architecture description language (ADL) constructs, and thus allows a powerful top-down approach to pipeline verification. We applied this methodology to the DLX processor to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach","1530-1591","0-7695-1471-5","","10.1109/DATE.2002.998247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998247","","Architecture description languages;Computer architecture;Cost accounting;Data mining;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Microprocessors;Pipelines;Software tools;Space exploration","embedded systems;finite state machines;formal verification;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;pipeline processing","Architecture Description Language;DLX processor;automatic verification;deeply pipelined processor architectures;embedded systems;finite state machine;fragmented pipelines;in-order execution;microprocessors;modeling techniques;multicycle functional units;top-down approach","","4","","21","","","2002","04 Mar 2002-08 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We could opt for error correction, which exhibits larger decoding overhead, or for the retransmission of the incorrectly received data word. Provided the timing penalty associated with this latter technique can be tolerated, we show that retransmission strategies are more effective than correction ones from an energy viewpoint, both for the larger detection capability and for the minor decoding complexity.

Proceedings","20020807","2002","","","702","707","In this paper we address the problem of simultaneous routing and buffer insertion. Simultaneous maze routing and buffer insertion under the Elmore delay model have been reported in the literature previously. Such algorithms can take into account both routing obstacles and restrictions on buffer locations. It is well known that Elmore delay is only a first-order approximation of signal delay and hence could be very inaccurate. Moreover, we cannot impose constraints on the transition times of the output signal waveform at the sink or at the buffers on the route. In this paper we extend previously reported algorithm so that accurate delay models (e.g., transmission line model, delay look-up table from SPICE, etc.) can be used We show that the problem of finding a minimum-delay buffered routing path can be formulated as a shortest path problem in a specially constructed weighted graph.

The number of tester channels with high data rates may be constrained in practice however due to ATE resource limitations, the power rating of the SOC, and scan frequency limits for the embedded cores. Therefore, we formulate the following optimization problem: given two available data rates for the tester channels, an SOC-level test access mechanism (TAM) width W, V (V < W) channels that can transport test data at the higher data rate, determine an SOC TAM architecture that minimizes the testing time.

The library is based on a general and systematic methodology that takes as input the original SystemC source code without any modification and provides the estimation parameters by simply including the library within a usual simulation. As a consequence, the same models of computation used during system design are preserved and all simulation conditions are maintained. The method exploits the advantages of dynamic analysis, that is, easy management of unpredictable data-dependent conditions and computational efficiency compared with other alternatives (ISS or RT simulation, without the need for SW generation and compilation and HW synthesis). Results obtained on several examples show the accuracy of the method.

However the method presented by Basturkmen et al. utilizes tests generated using a deterministic test generator for target faults in synthesizing the Markov source to generate the tests. The requirement of a deterministic test generator may hinder the use of this procedure in industrial settings since the BIST tool must also include a deterministic ATPG tool that may add to the cost of the BIST tool. In this paper we investigate a procedure to synthesize BIST controllers with Markov sources for test generation using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). This allows us to avoid using the deterministic ATPG needed previously. Additionally we do not employ inversion logic used in by Basturkmen et al., thereby potentially reducing the hardware in the BIST controller. Nevertheless, the proposed method achieves close to 100% fault efficiency using far fewer tests than required by pseudo random tests. In this work, similar to that of Basturkmen et al., we employ Markov sources based on finite state machines (FSMs) with transitions controlled by additional inputs. Hence, transition probabilities (TPs) of the FSM are determined by the 1-probability on a corresponding input.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253792","","Automatic test pattern generation;Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Cities and towns;Costs;Electrical fault detection;Evolutionary computation;Fault detection;Phase detection;Testing","Markov processes;automatic test pattern generation;built-in self test;finite state machines;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;probability","BIST controller synthesis;FSM;Markov sources;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary optimization;finite state machines;pseudo random scan BIST;test generation;transition probabilities","","4","","1","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works (Koorapaty et al., 2003; Koorapaty, 2003; Pileggi et al., 2003) showed that by employing even limited heterogeneity for the VPGA logic blocks, namely combining a 3-LUT with two 3-input Nand gates, one can achieve performance comparable to that provided by standard cells.

In [1], the focus was on power management with the goal being to extend battery life on the AMD Mobile Athlon. This was one of the earliest papers to use DVFS settings as actuators to guarantee a given energy level in the battery at the end of a given time interval. The controller was implemented using a combination of OS files and Linux kernel modules. Almost simultaneously, [2] posed the dynamic thermal management task as a formal control-theoretic problem requiring the thermal modeling of the processor and the use of the established control structures of classical feedback theory. Some of the defining features of [2] include the development of layout-based thermal RC models for the processor; the use of an architecturally-driven control mechanism, namely, the instruction fetching rate; and the use of the SPEC2000 benchmarks to illustrate temperature control action under various workloads. The controller used in [2] is a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) structure whose input is the deviation of the sensed temperature from the target temperature and whose output is the toggle rate of the instruction fetching mechanism.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513820","","Adaptation models;Integrated circuit modeling;Multicore processing;Program processors;Temperature control;Thermal management","","","","0","","23","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
