Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","38","","Today's situation in this field is characterized by three distinct development phases: First, the analysis and design of functionality. This type of work is typically performed in the laboratory, i.e. on the desk. Second, the implementation of a prototype system, realized by (semi)automatic code generation and followed by a test with a “Lab-car” or in a real vehicle. The third and final step comprises the calibration and fine-tuning of algorithms and their parameters, commonly done in a real car. However, there are some flaws associated with this approach. There is no support for multiple interconnected electronic control units. Automatic generation of code of production quality is still a challenging task. And there is a large gap between the properties of a virtual car and the behavior of the real vehicle. The latter is one reason why nowadays the adjustment of calibration parameters still needs to be done manually. In the future, the picture outlined above will change remarkably. Function development tools will be able to generate efficient and reliable software code automatically. Vehicle models will mimic the characteristics of the real object to an extent we cannot imagine today. And automated test without manual interference will unprecedented degree of optimization and quality throughout a complex network of electronic control units.

By 2015, according to Mark Pinto of Bell Labs, the microelectronics industry “will be manufacturing 10 million silicon transistors per human being per day … and the applications will exist to consume them.” Microelectronics, through its dramatic increase in performance, is the enabler of this revolution. Soon entire products-such as mobile telephones, computers and camcorders-will be based on single silicon chips, reducing product cost and price, opening new markets and boosting manufacturing. Microelectronic chips, together with embedded software, drive the entire ICT industry, by doubling performance and halving cost every 18 months, allowing continuous innovation in products such as mobile phones and smart cards and in services like the Internet and e-commerce. The chips generate new products used by professionals and laymen: 60 percent of today's electronics applications have been made possible solely by the technical progress of microelectronics.

"Managing dynamic reconfiguration overhead in systems-on-a-chip design using reconfigurable datapaths and optimized interconnection networks","Zhining Huang; Malik, S.","Dept. of Electr.

Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","735","740","This research examines the role of dynamically reconfigurable logic in systems-on-a-chip (SoC) design. Specifically we study the overhead of storing and downloading the configuration code bits for different parts of an application in a dynamically reconfigurable coprocessor environment. For SoC designs the different configuration bit-streams will likely need to be stored on chip, thus it becomes crucial to reduce the storage overhead. In addition, reducing the reconfiguration time overhead is crucial in realizing performance benefits. This study provides insight into the granularity of the reconfigurable logic that is appropriate for the SoC context. Our initial study is in the domain of multimedia and communication systems. We first present profiling results for these using the MESCAL compiler infrastructure. These results are used to derive an architecture template that consists of dynamically reconfigurable datapaths using coarse grain logic blocks and a reconfigurable interconnection network. We justify this template based on the constraints of SoC design. We then describe a design flow where we start from an application, derive the kernel loops via profiling and then map the application using the dynamically reconfigurable datapath and the simplest interconnection network. As part of this flow we have developed a mapping algorithm that minimizes the size of the interconnection network and thus the overhead of reconfiguration, which is key for systems-on-a-chip.

Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","40","46","Intellectual Property (IP) reuse is one of the most promising techniques addressing the design complexity problem. IP reuse assumes that pre-designed components can be integrated into the design under development, thereby reducing design complexity and time. On the other hand, as the number of IP providers increases, the selection of the best IP block for a given design becomes more challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an IP component matching system targeting automatic component searching and matching across the Internet. The system is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) specification both for IP libraries (a repository of pre-designed IP components indexed by their corresponding specifications) and IP user queries (specifications with incomplete/uncertain attributes). An IP query is parsed into a document object model (DOM) and the DOM is transformed to an internal tree-structured model.

The problem of finding an optimum test stimulus detecting all faults from the fault set is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. A functional describing the differences between the good and all faulty test responses of the circuit serves as a merit functional for the programming problem. A parameter vector completely describing the test stimulus is used as the optimization vector. The gradient of the merit functional required for the optimization is computed using time-domain sensitivities. Since in this approach the evaluation of the fault detection criterion represented by the merit functional flows directly into the computation of the test stimulus, optimal test stimuli for hard to detect faults can be generated.

Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","71","76","The register transfer abstraction (RTL) has been established as the industrial standard for ASIC design, soft IP exchange and the backend interface for chip design at higher level. Unfortunately, the “synthesizable” VHDL/Verilog incarnation of the RTL abstraction has problems which prevent it from more productive use. For example, the confusion as the result of using simulation semantics for synthesis purpose, the lack of facility for component reuse at the “protocol” level, and the lack of memory abstraction. After a detailed discussion of these problems, this paper proposes a new RTL abstraction, called MetaRTL, which can be implemented by a modest extension to the traditional imperative programming languages. The productivity gain is further demonstrated by the description of a synthesis tool, called MetaSyn, which provides the “added-value”.

For circuits without feedback, we give a sufficient condition for the worst-case power estimation error to increase only linearly with the length of the IP cascades. We also give a tighter sufficient condition that ensures error boundedness in IP systems of any topology. Experiments with signal processing and data encryption systems validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

Conference and Exhibition 2001. Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","696","","Processors designed for computer entertainment must perform 3D graphics calculations, especially geometry and perspective transformations. In the PlayStation(R)2, we introduced the new idea of synthesizing emotion called Emotion Synthesis and devised a new processor architecture to support its graphics demands. The architecture is embodied in the PlayStation(R)2's “Emotion Engine” CPU, which uses vector units (VUs) as the key units for floating-point calculations. Emotion synthesis means the real-time synthesis of a computer graphics animation scene that projects a great deal of atmosphere. For example, when a female character walks into a video game scene, her motion must be determined by solving physical equations in response to interactive events instead of replaying prerecorded data. Moreover, differential equations with a large number of variables must be used to describe, for example, the waving motions of her hair in a breeze. For authenticity in emotion synthesis, the CPU must execute these calculations in real time. “Emotion Engine” (“EE”) is a system LSI including a 300 MHz 128-bit 2-way superscalar RISC core, two Vector Units (“VU”s), Image Processing Unit (“IPU”) for MPEG-2 stream decode, a 10-channel memory access (DMA) controller, two channel Rambus(R) memory controller (RAC) and other peripheral modules. 13.5 M transistors are integrated on 15.02 mm×15.04 mm die with 0.25 μm device technology with 0.18 μm gate length. Design strategy and LSI design methodologies and CAD for “Emotion Engine” LSI are presented with emphasis on practical aspects of verification and timing closure.

Recently, simulation and test methods have been accompanied by formal methods such as equivalence checking and property checking. However their industrial applicability is currently restricted to small or medium sized designs or to a specific phase in the design cycle. In this paper, we present a method for verifying temporal properties of systems described in an executable description language. Our method allows the user to specify properties about the system in finite linear time temporal logic.

The virtual platform constitutes the foundation for design decisions early in the development phase, therefore enabling decisive and competitive advantages in the development process. This paper focuses on one of the key-enablers of the methodology, the universal communication model (UCM). The UCM is defined at a level of abstraction that allows accurate estimates of the performance including the latencies over the bus network, and good simulation performance.

Late changes or corrections in functional specifications (so-called “engineering change orders” or ECOs) force us to search for a minimal perturbation that achieves the desired repair. In reconfigurable design scenarios, these incremental repairs may be in response to physical faults: the goal is to “design around” the fault. For FPGAs, incremental rerouting is an essential component of this repair problem. We have developed a new incremental rerouting algorithm for FPGAs using techniques from Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). In this application, these techniques have the twin virtues that they (1) represent all possible routing (and rerouting) constraints simultaneously and exactly, and (2) search for rerouting solutions by perturbing all nets concurrently. Preliminary results are promising. For several FPGA benchmarks, we were able to reroute fault reconfigurations that perturb up to 5.74% of all nets for a small number of fault sets (one to four faults) with only 1.55 track overhead per channel on average, with CPU time 0.76 to 4.91 seconds/fault","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915079","","Application software;Design engineering;Electronic design automation and methodology;Error correction;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic design;Manufacturing;Reconfigurable logic;Routing;Wiring","Boolean functions;circuit layout CAD;computability;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis;integrated circuit layout;network routing","Boolean satisfiability-based incremental rerouting;FPGAs;fault reconfigurations;functional specification changes;incremental redesign;repair problem;rerouting constraints;routing constraints","","6","","13","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, not all the paths identified using such analysis can be sensitized. This leads to a pessimistic estimation of the processor speed. Also, no amount of engineering effort spent on optimizing such paths can improve the timing performance of the chip. In the past we demonstrated initial results of how ATPG techniques can be used to identify false paths efficiently. Due to the gap between the physical design on which the static timing analysis of the chip is bused and the test view on which the ATPG techniques are applied to identify false paths, in many cases only sections of some of the paths in the full-chip were analyzed in our initial results. In this paper, we will fully analyze all the timing paths using the ATPG techniques, thus overcoming the gap between the testing and timing analysis techniques.

Conference and Exhibition 2001. Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","799","","A practical solution to the complexity of design validation is semi-formal verification, where the specification of correctness criteria is done formally, as in model checking, but checking is done using simulation, which is guided by directed vector sequences derived from knowledge of the design and/or the property being checked. Simulation vectors must be effective in targeting the types of bugs designers expect to find rather than some generic coverage metrics. The focus of our work is to generate property-specific testbenches for guided simulation, that are targeted either at proving the correctness of a full CTL property or at finding a bug. This is facilitated by generation of a property-specific model, called a “witness graph”, which captures interesting paths in the design. Starting from an initial abstract model of the design, symbolic model checking, pruning, and refinement steps are applied in an iterative manner, until either a conclusive result is obtained or computing resources are exhausted. The witness graph is annotated with, e.g., state or transition priorities before testbench generation. The overall testbench generation flow, and the iterative flow for witness graph generation are shown","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915124","","Boolean functions;Computational modeling;Computer bugs;Concrete;Data structures;Gold;National electric code;Performance analysis;Testing;Upper bound","formal verification;graph theory;logic testing;symbol manipulation","correctness criteria;design validation;directed vector sequences;full CTL property;guided simulation;initial abstract model;property-specific witness graph generation;pruning;refinement steps;semi-formal verification;symbolic model checking;transition priorities","","1","3","","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of recently proposed BDD based approaches have met with considerable success in this area. However, the growing gap between the capability of current solvers and the complexity of verification instances necessitates the exploration of alternative, better solutions. This paper revisits the application of Satisfiability (SAT) algorithms to the combinational equivalence checking (CEC) problem. We argue that SAT is a more robust and flexible engine of Boolean reasoning for the CEC application than BDDs, which have traditionally been the method of choice. Preliminary results on a simple framework for SAT based CEC show a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art SAT based methods for CEC and also demonstrate that even with this simple algorithm and untuned prototype implementation it is only moderately slower and sometimes faster than a state-of-the-art BDD based mixed engine commercial CEC tool. While SAT based CEC methods need further research and tuning before they can surpass almost a decade of research in BDD based CEC, the recent progress is very promising and merits continued research","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915010","","Algorithm design and analysis;Binary decision diagrams;Circuit optimization;Design methodology;Digital circuits;Digital systems;Engines;Laboratories;Prototypes;Robustness","Boolean algebra;combinational circuits;formal verification;logic CAD","Boolean reasoning;SAT;Satisfiability algorithm;combinational circuits;combinational equivalence checking;formal verification methodology","","26","6","21","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is known that leakage power due to sub-threshold leakage current in transistors in the OFF state is dependent on the input vector applied. Therefore, we try to compute an input vector that can be applied to the circuit in stand-by mode so that the power loss due to sub-threshold leakage current is the minimum possible. We employ a integer linear programming (ILP) approach to solve the problem of minimizing leakage by first obtaining a good lower bound (estimate) on the minimum leakage power and then rounding the solution to actually obtain an input vector that causes low leakage. The chief advantage of this technique as opposed to others in the literature is that it invariably provides us with a good idea about the quality of the input vector found","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915051","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Current measurement;Design automation;Integer linear programming;Leakage current;MOSFETs;Power measurement;Threshold voltage;Vectors","CMOS logic circuits;integer programming;leakage currents;linear programming;logic design;logic gates;low-power electronics;minimisation of switching nets","AOI gates;input vector;integer linear programming;power loss;stand-by leakage power minimisation;static CMOS circuits;subthreshold leakage current;transistors","","10","2","10","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus of this paper is on the formal and heuristic algorithms we use to steer the data layout decisions and the experimental results obtained using a prototype tool. Experiments on real-life demonstrators illustrate that we are able to reduce up to 82% of the conflict misses for applications that are already aggressively transformed at the source-level. At the same time, we also reduce the off-chip data accesses by up to 78% and combined with address optimizations we are able to reduce the execution time.

Conference and Exhibition 2001. Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","233","239","Efficient circuit partitioning is gaining more importance with the increasing size of modern circuits. Conventionally, circuit partitioning is solved by modeling a circuit as a hypergraph for the ease of applying graph algorithms. However there exists room for further improvement on even optimum hypergraph partitioning results, if logic information can be applied for perturbation. In this paper we present a multi-way partitioning framework which can couple any excellent hypergraph partitioner and a noval logic perturbation based technique (GBAW) for further improvement over very excellent partitioning results. Our approach can integrate with any graph partitioner. We performed experiments on 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-way partitionings for various circuits of different sizes from MCNC benchmarks.

VHDL gate models that are capable of propagating faults in fault queues perform this fault simulation. The gate models process their fault queues and propagate them in delta time units. In these models, gates with faulty input values are expanded in delta time to evaluate faulty output values and propagate them to other sections of the circuit.

Conference and Exhibition 2001. Proceedings","20020807","2001","","","488","494","For innovative portable products, Systems on Chips (SoCs) containing several processors, memories and specialised modules are obviously required. Performances but also low-power are main issues in the design of such SoCs. Are these low-power SoCs only constructed with low-power processors, memories and logic blocks? If the latter are unavoidable, many other issues are quite important for low-power SoCs, such as the way to synchronise the communications between processors as well as test procedures, online testing, software design and development tools. This paper is a general framework for the design of low-power SoCs, starting from the system level to the architecture level, assuming that the SoC is mainly based on the re-use of low-power processors, memories and logic peripherals. SoCs with many processors, co-processors, memories and peripherals cannot be synchronised with a single master clock, due to larger and larger wire delays in deep submicron technologies. Several clocking schemes have been proposed, such as GALS (Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous) but also full asynchronous architectures. This paper will present the advantages and disadvantages of these SoC clocking strategies as well as the impacts on low power. For embedded SoCs containing several processors, one has to write several pieces of software for each processor starting typically from a high-level specification using the C/C++ language. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to first transform the original specification by means of a systematic script of platform-independent source code transformations. That is illustrated by applying global loop transformation techniques to identify asynchronous partitions exhibiting little communication and high locality of access characteristics. In a second stage, we explore multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) mapping onto a given (partly) predefined platform using advanced space-time analysis techniques to maintain low data transfer rates while achieving high system throughput. At the SoC level, accurate cost feedback including high-level power estimation is required. From this essential information, energy trade-offs between application sub-modules can for example be used to refine the solution further. In the case of mapping onto programmable cores with a shared memory hierarchy, a final refinement consists in reorganising the data layout for efficient cache utilisation","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915068","","","C language;VLSI;application specific integrated circuits;asynchronous circuits;delays;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;low-power electronics;shared memory systems","C language;C++ language;GALS;cache utilisation;clocking schemes;deep submicron technologies;development tools;energy trade-offs;full asynchronous architectures;global loop transformation techniques;high-level power estimation;high-level specification;locally synchronous;logic peripherals;low-power systems on chips;multiple-instruction multiple-data mapping;online testing;platform-independent source code transformations;programmable cores;shared memory hierarchy;software design;space-time analysis techniques;system throughput;test procedures;wire delays","","1","","33","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the functional decomposition that targets LUT FPGAs, the circuit is constructed by recursively decomposing a given function and its sub-functions until each of the resulting sub-functions can be directly implemented with a LUT. The choice of sub-functions constructed in this process decides the quality of the resulting multi-level circuit expressed in terms of the logic block count and speed. In this paper, we propose a new effective and efficient method for the sub-function construction, and we consider its application in our circuit synthesis tool that targets LUT-based FPGAs.

The new RC boards offer a wealth of memory banks many of them on-chip (such as the BlockRAMs available in the Virtex architecture) and many of them offering variable number of ports and several depth/width configurations. Along with the external RAMs, a hierarchy of memories with varying access performances are available in a reconfigurable computer. It becomes critical to perform a good mapping to achieve optimal design performance. This paper presents an automatic memory mapping methodology which takes into account: the number of words and word size of design data segments and physical memory banks, number of ports on the banks, access latency of the banks, proximity of the banks to the processing unit, life cycle analysis of data segments, and it also incorporates configuration selection from the multiple configurations available in BlockRAMs of Virtex series FPGAs.

To solve the most part of data hazards in the pipeline, processors use forwarding (or bypassing) hardware to provide the required operands from the inter-stage pipeline registers directly to the inputs of the function units. The operands are then stored in the register file during the write-back pipeline stage. In this paper, we propose a power optimization technique based on the exploitation of the forwarding paths in the processor to avoid the power cost of writing/reading short-lived variables to/from the register file. In application-specific embedded systems, experimental evidence has shown that a significant number of variables are short-lived, that is their liveness (front first definition to last use) spans only few instructions. Values of short-lived variables can be accessed directly through the forwarding registers, avoiding write-back. An application example of our solution to a VLIW embedded core, when accessing the register file, has shown a power saving up to 35% with respect to the unoptimized approach on the given set of target benchmarks.

To overcome the drawback, our algorithm constructs a cluster that consists of registers with the same clock input timing located in a close area. In our algorithm, first registers are partitioned into clusters by their locations, and clusters are modified to improve the clock period while maintaining the radius of each cluster small. In our experiments for an industrial data of 888 registers, the clock period achieved is 27% shorter than that achieved by a zero-skew clock tree, and 1% longer than the theoretical minimum.

In this paper we extend the method to deal with coarse-grain operations in static scheduled VLIW processors as is introduced by Busa (2000). We allow functional units with a controller that does not traverse its states in a predefined way. This makes it possible to execute a function that contains a conditional construct like an if-statement as a single operation on a functional unit. In this way the performance penalty otherwise caused by branch instructions is reduced. By adding valid input and output signals, the problem is circumvented that during compilation it is, for this type of functional unit, not known when and how many samples will be consumed or produced. We refer to these units as Conditional Input/output Units (CIUs). The operations that are executed on CIUs are called Conditional Input/output Operations (CIOs).

Traditional caches had to compromise between the different types of locality required by the access patterns, and trade-off performance against bandwidth requirement. Instead, our approach customizes the local memory architecture matching the diverse access patterns and locality types present in the application, to reduce the main memory bandwidth requirement, and significantly improve power consumption, without sacrificing performance.

Any accurate delay model, such as delay models based on the transmission line model and SPICE simulations, can be incorporated into our algorithm. The algorithm determines the optimal number of buffers and their locations on a wire such that some optimization objective is satisfied. Two typical examples of such optimization objectives are minimizing the 50% threshold delay and minimizing the transition time. Both can be easily determined in our algorithm. We show that the buffer insertion problem can be reduced to a shortest path problem.

The main challenge for any symbolic analysis method is the exponential size of the produced symbolic expressions (10<sup>11</sup> terms for an op amp). Current research considers two ways of handling this limitation: approximation of symbolic expressions and hierarchical methods. Approximation methods retain only the significant terms of the symbolic expressions and eliminate the insignificant ones. The difficulty, however, lies in identifying what terms to eliminate and what the resulting approximation error could be. Hierarchical methods tackle the symbolic analysis problem in a divide-and-conquer manner. They consider only one part of the global network at a time and then recombine partial expressions for finding overall symbolic formulas. Existing hierarchical methods have a main limitation in that they are not feasible for addressing networks that are built of tightly coupled blocks, i.e. operational amplifiers. The originality of our research stems from exploiting regularity aspects for addressing the exponential size of produced symbolic expressions. As a result, polynomial-size models are obtained for any network, including networks formed of tightly coupled blocks. Two kinds of regularity aspects were identified","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","","10.1109/DATE.2001.915132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915132","","Analog integrated circuits;Approximation error;Circuits and systems;Contracts;Equations;Filters;Large-scale systems;Operational amplifiers;Partitioning algorithms;Polynomials","analogue integrated circuits;divide and conquer methods;integrated circuit modelling;large-scale systems;symbol manipulation","divide-and-conquer manner;exponential size;large-scale analog networks;partial expressions;polynomial-size models;regularity-based hierarchical symbolic analysis method;tightly coupled blocks","","0","","","","","2001","13 Mar 2001-16 Mar 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore timing waveforms are calculated not for all internal nodes of the gate-level circuit but only for outputs of macros.

In our previous work, it has been demonstrated that efficient and accurate simulation of substrate noise generation at gate-level is feasible. In this paper several important extensions to our previous work are introduced: modeling of I/O cells, modeling of input transition time and load dependency and the extraction methodology of an equivalent substrate model within multiple supply domains.

This lack of efficient compilation tools has also severely hampered the design space exploration of code-size efficient instruction sets, and correspondingly, their tuning to the application domain. In Zhao et al (Proc. 14th Int.

The library is based on a general and systematic methodology that takes as input the original SystemC source code without any modification and provides the estimation parameters by simply including the library within a usual simulation. As a consequence, the same models of computation used during system design are preserved and all simulation conditions are maintained. The method exploits the advantages of dynamic analysis, that is, easy management of unpredictable data-dependent conditions and computational efficiency compared with other alternatives (ISS or RT simulation, without the need for SW generation and compilation and HW synthesis). Results obtained on several examples show the accuracy of the method. In addition to the fundamental parameters needed for system-level design exploration, the proposed methodology allows the designer to include capture points at any place in the code.
