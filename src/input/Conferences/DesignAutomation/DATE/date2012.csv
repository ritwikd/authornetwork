"A methodology for automated design of hard-real-time embedded streaming systems","Bamakhrama, M.A.; Zhai, J.T.; Nikolov, H.; Stefanov, T.","Leiden Inst. of Adv. Comput.

For instance, the applications evolved to the point that in many cases hard-real-time execution on multiprocessor platforms is needed in order to meet the applications' timing requirements. Moreover, in some cases, there is a need to run a set of such applications simultaneously on the same platform with support for accepting new incoming applications at run-time. Dealing with all these new challenges increases significantly the complexity of system design. However, the design time must remain acceptable. This requires the development of novel systematic and automated design methodologies driven by the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose such a novel methodology for automated design of an embedded multiprocessor system, which can run multiple hard-real-time streaming applications simultaneously. Our methodology does not need the complex and time-consuming design space exploration phase, present in most of the current state-of-the art multiprocessor design frameworks. In contrast, our methodology applies very fast yet accurate schedulability analysis to determine the minimum number of processors, needed to schedule the applications, and the mapping of applications' tasks to processors. Furthermore, our methodology enables the use of hard-real-time multiprocessor scheduling theory to schedule the applications in a way that temporal isolation and a given throughput of each application are guaranteed. We evaluate an implementation of our methodology using a set of real-life streaming applications and demonstrate that it can greatly reduce the design time and effort while generating high quality hard-real-time systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176632","","Algorithm design and analysis;Design methodology;Processor scheduling;Production;Program processors;Schedules;Timing","computational complexity;electronic design automation;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","application timing requirements;embedded multiprocessor system;hard-real-time embedded streaming systems automated design;hard-real-time multiprocessor scheduling theory;schedulability analysis;state-of-the art multiprocessor design frameworks;system design complexity;time-consuming design space exploration phase","","4","","18","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach allows us to lower test cost by reducing test time for a given pin budget, or by reducing the number of test pins without impacting test time. To further improve resource utilization, we consider the use of MISRs for compacting the test responses of embedded cores. Experimental results for ITC'02 test benchmarks demonstrate that pin-count-aware co-optimization leads to shorter test times for a given pin-count budget and fewer pins for a given test-time budget.

An application is modeled as a set of tasks, and we consider a fixed-priority preemptive scheduling policy. We target the early design phases, when decisions have a high impact on the subsequent implementation choices. However, due to a lack of information, the early design phases are characterized by uncertainties, e.g., in the worst-case execution times (wcets), or in the functionality requirements. We model uncertainties in the wcets using the “percentile method”. The uncertainties in the functionality requirements are captured using “future scenarios”, which are task sets that model functionality likely to be added in the future. In this context, we derive a mapping of tasks in the application, such that the resulted implementation is both robust and flexible. Robust means that the application has a high chance of being schedulable, considering the wcet uncertainties, whereas a flexible mapping has a high chance to successfully accommodate the future scenarios. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach to solve this optimization problem.

During system-level DSE, system parameters like, e.g., the number and type of processors, the type and size of memories, or the mapping of application tasks to architectural resources, are considered. Simulation-based DSE, in which different design instances are evaluated using system-level simulations, typically are computationally costly. Even using high-level simulations and efficient exploration algorithms, the simulation time to evaluate design points forms a real bottleneck in such DSE. Therefore, the vast design space that needs to be searched requires effective design space pruning techniques. This paper presents a technique to reduce the number of simulations needed during system-level DSE. More specifically, we propose an iterative design space pruning methodology based on static throughput analysis of different application mappings.

Researchers have implemented reversible logic gates in optical computing domain as it can provide high speed and low energy requirement along with easy fabrication at the chip level [1]. The all optical implementation of reversible gates are based on semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) due to its significant advantages such as high speed, low power, fast switching time and ease in fabrication. In this work we present the all optical implementation of an n bit reversible ripple carry adder for the first time in literature. The all optical reversible adder design is based on two new optical reversible gates referred as optical reversible gate I (ORG-I) and optical reversible gate II (ORG-II) and the existing all optical Feynman gate. The two new reversible gates ORG-I and ORGI-I are proposed as they can implement a reversible adder with reduced optical cost which is the measure of number of MZIs switches and the propagation delay, and with zero overhead in terms of number of ancilla inputs and the garbage outputs. The proposed all optical reversible adder design based on the ORG-I and ORG-II reversible gates are compared and shown to be better than the other existing designs of reversible adder proposed in non-optical domain in terms of number of MZIs, delay, number of ancilla inputs and the garbage outputs.

Additionally a secure activation mechanism has been proposed to this standard in order to restrict access to the testing interface to eligible testers by using a cryptographic authentication mechanism. This access mechanism is necessary in order not to provide any side-channels which may leak secret information for attackers. However, this approach requires the authentication mechanism to be implemented in hardware incurring an area overhead, and the authentication secrets to be securely stored in non-volatile memory (NVM), which may be susceptible to side-channel attacks.

The inherent trade-offs between such metrics need to be explored in order to choose a solution that meets design and cost expectations. We address the generic problem of automatically deriving a hardware implementation from a high-level task description. In this paper we present a novel technique that exploits previously explored implementation design spaces in order to find optimal trade-offs for new high-level descriptions. This technique is generalizable to a range of high-level synthesis problems in which trade-offs can be exposed by changing the parameters of the hardware generation tool. Our strategy, based upon machine learning techniques, models the impact of the parameterization of the tool on the target objectives, given the characteristics of the input. Thus, a predictor is able to suggest a subset of parameters that are likely to lead to optimal hardware implementations. The proposed method is evaluated on a resource sharing problem which is typical in high level synthesis, where the trade-offs between area and performance need to be explored.

For this reason, we expect that this technology will be increasingly adopted in emerging multi-application reconfigurable systems. This paper introduces a fully automated design flow that exploits multi-objective design space exploration to enable runtime resource management for the Molen reconflgurable architecture. The entry point of the design flow is the application source code; our flow is able to heuristically determine a set of candidate hardware/software configurations of the application (i.e., operating points) that trade off the occupation of the reconflgurable fabric (in this case, an FPGA), the load of the master processor and the performance of the application itself. This information enables a run-time manager to exploit more efficiently the available system resources in the context of multiple applications. We present the results of an experimental campaign where we applied the proposed design flow to two reference audio applications mapped on the Molen architecture. The analysis proved that the overhead of the design space exploration and operating points extraction with respect to the original Molen flow is within reasonable bounds since the final synthesis time still represents the major contribution. Besides, we have found that there is a high variance in terms of execution time speedup associated with the operating points of the application (characterized by a different usage of the FPGA) which can be exploited by the run-time manager to increase/decrease the quality of service of the application depending on the available resources<sup>1</sup>.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176578","","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Resource management;Software;Space exploration;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;reconfigurable architectures","FPGA;Molen reconflgurable architecture;full-blown operating system;fully automated design flow;master processor;multiapplication reconfigurable systems;multiobjective design space exploration;operating points extraction;quality of service;run-time resource management;two reference audio applications","","7","","23","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some special design concerns, e.g., the write-pattern-dependent write reliability, are raised by this observation. We systematically analyze the root reasons to form the asymmetric switching of the MTJ and study their impacts on STT-RAM write operations. These factors include the thermal-induced statistical MTJ magnetization process, asymmetric biasing conditions of NMOS transistors, and both NMOS and MTJ device variations. We also explore the design space of different design methodologies on capturing the switching asymmetry of different STT-RAM cell structures. Our experiment results proved the importance of full statistical design method in STT-RAM designs for design pessimism minimization.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176695","","MOSFETs;Magnetic tunneling;Random access memory;Resistance;Switches;Switching circuits","CMOS memory circuits;MOSFET;integrated circuit reliability;magnetic tunnelling;random-access storage;statistical analysis","CMOS process compatibility;MTJ switching asymmetry;NMOS transistors;STT-RAM cell structures;STT-RAM design;asymmetric biasing conditions;design pessimism minimization;high integration density;magnetic tunneling junction device;nanosecond access time;next-generation nonvolatile memory technologies;reliability;spin-transfer torque random access memory;statistical design method;thermal-induced statistical MTJ magnetization process;write-pattern-dependent","","8","","12","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, there are applications, in particular in the area of partial design verification, where SAT formulas are not expressive enough and a description via Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) is much more adequate. In this paper we introduce incremental QBF solving and thereby make it usable as a core component of BMC. To do so, we realized an incremental version of the state-of-the-art QBF solver QuBE, allowing for the reuse of learnt information e.g. in the form of conflict clauses and solution cubes. As an application we consider BMC for partial designs (i.e. designs containing so-called blackboxes) and thereby disprove realizability, that is, we prove that an unsafe state is reachable no matter how the blackboxes are implemented. In our experimental analysis, we compare different incremental approaches implemented in our BMC tool. BMC with incremental QBF turns out to be feasible for designs with more than 21,000 gates and 2,700 latches. Significant performance gains over non incremental QBF based BMC can be obtained on many benchmark circuits, in particular when using the so-called backward-incremental approach combined with incremental preprocessing.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176547","","Benchmark testing;Data preprocessing;Encoding;Latches;Logic gates;Performance gain;System-on-a-chip","Boolean functions;formal verification","BMC;benchmark circuits;bounded model checking;core component;formal verification tools;incremental QBF solving;partial design verification;quantified Boolean formulas","","2","","20","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When VLIW processors are considered, standard processor-oriented SBST approaches result deficient since not able to cope with most of the failures affecting VLIW multiple parallel domains. In this paper we present a novel SBST algorithm specifically oriented to test the register files of VLIW processors. In particular, our algorithm addresses the cross-bar switch architecture of the VLIW register file by completely covering the intrinsic faults generated between the multiple computational domains. Fault simulation campaigns comparing previously developed methods with our solution demonstrate its effectiveness.

The potential speedup provided by reconfigurable logic is reduced by the overhead of RTL synthesis/implementation. This overhead can be mitigated by reducing the number of FPGA implementation processes, through the adoption of binary-level translation. Hereby we present a prototyping method that, given a set of candidate ASIP configurations, defines an overdimensioned ASIP architecture, capable of emulating all the design space points under evaluation.

The negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) is among the most important sources of the aging mechanisms. Applying the traditional guardbanding technique to address the decreased speed of devices is too costly. Due to presence of the narrow-width values, integer register files in high-performance microprocessors suffer a very high NBTI stress. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware register file (AARF) design to combat the NBTI-induced aging in integer register files. The proposed AARF design can mitigate the negative aging effects by balancing the duty cycle ratio of the internal bits in register files. By gating the leading bits of the narrow-width values during the register accesses, our AARF can also achieve a significantly power reduction, which will further reduce the temperature and NBTI degradation of integer register files. Our experimental results show that AARF can effectively reduce the NBTI stress with a 36.9% power saving for integer register files.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176528","","Aging;Degradation;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Registers;Reliability;Stress","logic design;low-power electronics;performance evaluation;power aware computing;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor technology","CMOS device degradation;NBTI-induced aging;aging mechanisms;deep submicron semiconductor technologies;duty cycle balancing;duty cycle ratio;guardbanding technique;high-performance microprocessors;integer register files;low power aging-aware register file design;narrow-width values;negative bias temperature instability;power saving","","5","","18","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RHC can be reconfigured by powering on/off SRAM/NVM arrays in a way-based manner. In this work, we discuss both the architecture and circuit design issues for RHC. Furthermore, we provide hardware-based mechanisms to dynamically reconfigure RHC on-the-fly based on the cache demand. Experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks show that the proposed RHC achieves an average 63%, 48% and 25% energy saving over non-reconfigurable SRAM-based cache, non-reconfigurable hybrid cache, and reconfigurable SRAM-based cache, while maintaining the system performance (at most 4% performance overhead).","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176431","","Arrays;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change random access memory;Radiation detectors;Runtime","SRAM chips;cache storage","cache system;circuit design;dynamically reconfigurable hybrid cache;energy-efficient last-level cache design;hardware-based mechanism;hybrid cache architecture;nonreconfigurable SRAM-based cache;nonreconfigurable hybrid cache;nonvolatile memory;phase-change RAM;spin-torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM","","5","","26","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To obtain digital test results compatible with low-cost ATE, an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.

This paper presents a new out-of-order simulator for multi-core parallel DE simulation of hardware/software designs at any abstraction level. By localizing the simulation time and carefully handling events at different times, a system model can be simulated following a partial order of time.

Currently, they are designed around off-the-shelf low-power microcontrollers for on-the-node processing. However, by employing more appropriate hardware, the energy consumption can be significantly reduced. This paper identifies that many WSN applications employ algorithms which can be solved by using parallel prefix-sums. Therefore, an alternative architecture is proposed to calculated them energy-efficiently. It consists of several parallel processing elements (PEs) structured as a folded tree. Profiling SystemC models of the design with ActivaSC helps to improve data-locality.

This task is performed by the ROB (ReOrder Buffer) that uses usually multi-ports RAM, but only two-port buffers are available in FPGA. In this work, we propose a FPGA friendly ROB (ReOrder Buffer) architecture using only 2 ports RAM called a multi-bank ROB architecture.

Although RRAM promises many attractive advantages (e.g., huge data storage, smaller form-factor, lower power consumption, non-volatility, etc.), there are many open issues that still need to be solved, especially those related to its quality and reliability. For instance, open defects may cause RRAM cell to enter an undefined state (i.e., somewhere between logic 0 and 1), making it hard to detect during manufacturing test. As a consequence, this may lead to test escapes (quality issue) and field failures (reliability issue). This paper shows - based on defect and circuit simulation - how testing RRAM is different from testing conventional random access memories and how march test cannot guarantee higher defect coverage. The paper then motivates the need of development of special Design-for-Testability (DfT). A concept of a new DfT is then proposed. The concept is further exploited and mapped into two different DfT circuitries: (i) Short Write Time and (ii) Low Write Voltage. Both DfT schemes are implemented and simulated; the simulation results show that defects causing the RRAM cell to enter an undefined state are easily detected.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176603","Design-for-Testability;memory defect;memristor;quality;reliability","Bismuth;Circuit faults;Clocks;Lead;Memristors;Phase change random access memory;Reliability","design for testability;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;random-access storage","DfT schemes;RRAM;circuit simulation;computer systems;design-for-testability;low write voltage;manufacturing test;reliability;resistive open defects;resistive random access memory;short write time","","11","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parallel architectures such as coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture, where multiple PEs are tightly coupled with each other, can be a viable solution to the problem. However, the PEs are typically controlled by a centralized control unit, which makes it hard to parallelize programs requiring different control of each PE. To overcome this limitation, it is essential to convert control flows into data flows by adopting the predicated execution technique, but it may incur additional power consumption. This paper reveals power issues in the predicated execution and proposes a novel technique to mitigate power overhead of predicated execution. Contrary to the conventional approach, the proposed mechanism can decide whether to suppress instruction execution or not without decoding the instructions and does not require additional instruction bits, thereby resulting in energy savings. Experimental results show that energy consumed by the reconfigurable array and its configuration memory is reduced by up to 23.9%.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176704","CGRA;low power design;predicated execution;predication;reconfigurable architecture","Arrays;Decoding;Energy consumption;Interpolation;Power demand;Radiation detectors;Registers","centralised control;low-power electronics;parallel architectures;reconfigurable architectures","centralized control unit;configuration memory;control flow;data flow;energy consumption;energy saving;instruction bit;instruction execution suppression;instructions decoding;low power coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture design;multiple PE;multiple processing element;parallel architecture;power consumption;power overhead mitigation;predicated execution technique;reconfigurable array;state-based full predication","","3","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing K longest path generation (KLPG) algorithms use a data structure called path store to prune the search space by restricting the number of sub-paths considered at the same time. While this restriction speeds up the KLPG process, the algorithms lose their optimality and do not guarantee that the K longest sensitizable paths are indeed found. We investigate, for the first time, the effects of missing some of the longest paths on the defect coverage. We systematically quantify how setting different limits on the path-store size affects the numbers and relative lengths of identified paths, as well as the run-times of the algorithm. We also introduce a new optimal KLPG algorithm that works iteratively and pinpointedly addresses defect locations for which the path-store size limit has been exceeded in previous iterations. We compare this algorithm with a naïve KLPG approach that achieves optimality by setting the path-store size limit to a very large value.

Channel estimation (CE) is one of the most computation intensive tasks in a software-defined radio (SDR) based OFDM demodulator. Complementary to the conventional low-power design methodology on processor architectures or circuits, we propose to reduce power also at the algorithm level. The idea is to dynamically scale the processing load of the channel estimator according to the run-time estimated channel quality. In this work, with a case study on China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting (CMMB) standard, three practical CE algorithms are adopted to form a complexity scalable algorithm set, and signal noise ratio (SNR) is chosen to be the channel quality parameter for CE algorithm switching. In order to accurately estimate the SNR in the run-time, we also propose a noise variance estimation algorithm which is robust against fast-fading channels and introduces small computation overheads. Simulation shows that, under a pre-defined scenario for our targeting SDR demodulator, more than 50% run-time load reduction can be achieved compared with a fixed worst case channel estimator, while still fulfilling the mean square error requirement, resulting in about 25% of power reduction for the total demodulator. In addition, complexity adaption enables dynamical voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) in a SDR demodulator which can lead to furthermore power reduction.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176716","","Algorithm design and analysis;Channel estimation;Complexity theory;OFDM;Signal processing algorithms;Signal to noise ratio","OFDM modulation;channel estimation;demodulators;digital multimedia broadcasting;fading channels;mean square error methods;mobile radio;software radio","CMMB standard;China mobile multimedia broadcasting;DVFS;OFDM demodulator;SDR;SDR demodulator;SNR;channel estimation;complexity adaptive channel estimator;complexity scalable algorithm;dynamical voltage and frequency scaling;fast- fading channels;low-power design methodology;mean square error;processor architectures;signal noise ratio;software-defined radio","","0","","19","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In SRAMs, variabilities reduce yield and necessitate extensive interventions, such as the use of increasing numbers of spares to achieve acceptable yield. For most microprocessor chips, the number of SRAM bits is expected to grow 2× for every generation. Consequently, microprocessor chip yields will be seriously undermined if no defect-tolerance approach is used. In this paper, we show the limits of the traditional spares-based defect-tolerance approaches for SRAMs. We then propose and implement a software-based approach for improving cache yield. We demonstrate that our approach can significantly increase microprocessor chip yields (normalized with respect to chip area) compared to the traditional approaches, for upcoming fabrication technologies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach dramatically increases effective computing capacity, measured in MIPS-per-unit-chip-area. Our approach does not require any hardware design changes and hence can be applied to improve yield of any modern microprocessor chip, incurs low performance penalty only for the chips with unrepaired defects in SRAMs, and adapts without requiring any design changes as the yield improves for a particular design and fabrication technology.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176686","","Benchmark testing;Fabrication;Hardware;Maintenance engineering;Microprocessor chips;Random access memory;Wires","SRAM chips;cache storage;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;microprocessor chips;nanofabrication","SRAM;caches;hardware design;microprocessor chips;nano-scale fabrication technology","","3","","17","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it conventionally involves an “L-shaped” butterfly datapath whose irregular shape has uneven latencies and makes scheduling difficult. This work proposes a split-radix datapath that avoids the L-shape. With this, the split-radix algorithm can be mapped onto a constant geometry interconnect structure in which the wiring in each FFT stage is identical, resulting in low multiplexing overhead. Further, we exploit the lower arithmetic complexity of split-radix to lower dynamic power, by gating the multipliers during trivial multiplications.

NEMS switching devices have been mostly used as simple switches to provide digital operation, however, we observe that their unique operation can be used to accomplish logic functions directly. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called `weighted area logic' to design logic circuits with NEMS-based switches. The technique takes advantage of the unique structural configurations possible with the NEMS devices to convert the digital switch from a simple ON-OFF switch to a logical switch. This transformation not only reduces the delay of complex logic units, but also decreases the power and area of the implementation further. To demonstrate this, we show the new designs of the logic functions of NAND, XOR and a three input function Y = A + B.C, and compose them into a 32-bit adder. Through simulation, we quantify the power, delay and area advantages of using the weighted area logic technique over a standard CMOS-like design technique applied to NEMS.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176565","","Delay;Force;Logic design;Logic functions;Logic gates;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Switches","cantilevers;nanoelectromechanical devices;switches","NEMS switching devices;NEMS-based devices;NEMS-based switches;ON-OFF switch;cantilever-based NEMS switches;complex logic units;digital circuits;electrical effects;electromechanical principles;electromechanically enabled logic computation;integrated chip design;logic circuits;logic functions;logical switch;low power switching characteristics;nanoelectromechanical systems;nanoscale technology;near-ideal digital switches;standard CMOS-like design;weighted area logic technique;weighted area technique","","1","","","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper first introduces the dual concepts of reverse domination and non-solution implications. A SAT solver is tailored to leverage reverse dominators for the early on-the-fly detection of bug-free components. These are non-solution areas and their early pruning significantly reduces the the debugging search-space. This process is expedited by branching on error-select variables first.

To mitigate these failure rates, we propose a novel error mitigation mechanism that relies on a hybrid HW-SW technique. In our proposal, we enforce SoC SRAMs by implementing a fault-tolerant memory buffer with minimal capacity to ensure error-free operation. We utilize this buffer to temporarily store a portion of the stored data, named a data chunk, that is used to restore another data chunk in a fully demand-driven way, in case the latter is faulty. We formulate the buffer and data chunk size selection as an optimization problem that targets energy overhead minimization, given that timing and area overheads are restricted with hard constraints decided beforehand by the system designers. We show that our proposed mitigation scheme achieves full error mitigation in a real SoC platform with an average of 10.1% energy overhead with respect to a base-line system operation, while guaranteeing all the design-time constraints.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176661","","Benchmark testing;Buffer storage;Error correction codes;Proposals;Reliability;System-on-a-chip;Timing","SRAM chips;buffer circuits;embedded systems;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;minimisation;network synthesis;system-on-chip","HW-SW approach;SMU failure rate augmentation;SoC SRAM;base-line system operation;buffer size selection;data chunk restoration;data chunk size selection;data storage;design-time constraint;energy overhead;error mitigation mechanism;error-free operation;failure mitigation;fault-tolerant memory buffer;intermittent error mitigation;optimization problem;overhead minimization target;reliability;single-event multi-bit upset failure rates augmentation;streaming-based embedded system;systems-on-chip","","2","1","15","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, if the model is inconsistent, these approaches do not provide further information to assist the designer in finding the error. In this work, we present an automatic debugging approach which determines contradiction candidates, i.e. a small subset of the original model explaining the conflict. These contradiction candidates aid the designer in finding the error faster and therefore accelerate the whole design process.

The proposed architecture adds one extra cycle to execute custom instructions (CIs) that violate the maximum allowed propagation delay due to the process variations. Using this method, the parametric yield of manufactured chips will greatly improve. The cost is an increase in the cycle latency of some of the CIs, and hence, a slight performance degradation for the extensible processor architectures. To minimize the performance penalty of the proposed approach, we introduce a new merit function for selecting the CIs during the selection phase of the ISA extension design flow. To evaluate the efficacy of the new selection method, we compare the extended ISAs obtained by this method with those selected based on the worst-case delay. Simulation results reveal that a speedup improvement of about 18% may be obtained by the proposed selection method.

In today's deep sub-micron era, circuit wires have become a dominating factor in most EDA processes and there are situations where removing a certain set of (perhaps extremely unwanted) wires is very useful. However, it has been experimentally suggested that the rewiring rate (percentage of original circuit wires being removable by rewiring) is only 30 to 40% for optimized circuits in the past. In this paper, we propose a generalized error cancellation modeling and flow to show that theoretically almost every circuit wire is removable under this flow. In the Flow graph Error Cancellation based Rewiring (FECR) scheme we propose here, a rewiring rate of 95% of even optimized circuits is obtainable under this scheme, affirming the basic claim of this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first known rewiring scheme being able to achieve this near complete rewiring rate. Consequently, this wire-removal process can now be considered as a powerful atomic and universal operation for logic transformations, as virtually every circuit node can also be removed through repetitions of this rewiring process. Besides, this modeling can also serve as a general framework containing many other rewiring techniques as its special cases.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176723","","Circuit faults;Flow graphs;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Testing;Vectors;Wires","electronic design automation;graph theory;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic design","EDA processes;circuit wire;flow graph error cancellation based rewiring;generalized error cancellation modeling;logic transformation technique;rewiring technique","","3","","12","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, a new method, called AYLeSS, is proposed to estimate the yield of analog circuits by introducing Latin Supercube Sampling (LSS) technique from the computational statistics field. Firstly, a partitioning method is proposed for analog circuits, whose purpose is to appropriately partition the process variation variables into low-dimensional sub-groups fitting for LSS sampling. Then, randomized QMC is used in each sub-group. In addition, the way to randomize the run order of samples in Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is used for the QMC sub-groups. AYLeSS is tested on 4 designs of 2 example circuits in 0.35μm and 90nm technologies with yield from about 50% to 90%.

In this paper, we propose a method to utilize both local and non-local network information to determine the optimal path to forward a packet.

The functionality of an FPGA circuit is represented by a programming bitstream that specifies the configuration of the FPGA's internal logic and routing. The proposed methodology allows different sets of design internal signals to be traced solely by changes to the programming bitstream followed by device reconfiguration and hardware execution. Evidently, the advantage of this new methodology vs. existing debug techniques is that it operates without the need of iterative executions of the computationally-intensive design re-synthesis, placement and routing tools. In essence, with a single execution of the synthesis flow, the new approach permits a large number of internal signals to be traced for an arbitrary number of clock cycles using a limited number of external pins. Experimental results using commercial FPGA vendor tools demonstrate productivity (i.e. run-time) improvements of up to 30× vs. a conventional approach to FPGA functional debugging.

A key aspect of the approach is a new threshold voltage (V<sub>T</sub>) assignment algorithm that employs a cost function that is globally aware of the entire circuit. Thresholds are first raised as much as possible subject to the delay constraint. To further reduce leakage, the delay constraint is then iteratively increased by Δ time units, each time enabling additional cells to have their threshold voltages increased. For each of the iterations, near-optimal cell size selection is applied so as to reacquire the original delay target. The leakage power iteratively reduces to a minimum, and then increases as substantial cell upsizing is required to re-establish the original delay target. We show results for benchmark and commercial circuits using a 40nm cell library in which four threshold voltage options are available. We show that the application of the new leakage power minimization algorithm appreciably reduces leakage power after multi-V<sub>T</sub> synthesis by a leading commercial tool, achieving an average post-synthesis leakage reduction of 37% while also reducing total active area and maintaining the original delay target.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176440","algorithm;leakage power;multiple threshold voltage (V<inf>T</inf>) optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Heuristic algorithms;Libraries;Minimization;Optimization","delays;integrated circuit design;iterative methods","cell library;cost function;delay constraint;near-optimal cell size selection;post-synthesis leakage power minimization;size 40 nm;substantial cell upsizing;threshold voltage assignment algorithm;total active area","","3","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, its further use is hindered by the lifetime issue, which is mainly impacted by wear leveling and bad block management (BBM). Besides initial bad blocks resulting from the manufacturing process, good blocks may eventually wear out due to the limited write endurance of flash cells, even with the best wear leveling strategy. Current BBM tracks both types of bad blocks, and keeps them away from regular use. However, when the amount of bad blocks exceeds a threshold, the entire chip is rendered non-functional. In this paper, we reconsider existing BBM, and propose a novel one that reuses worn-out blocks, utilizing them in wear leveling.

Formally verifying properties defined over such deeply embedded portions of the logic is challenging because formal methods do not scale to the size of the entire logic, and verifying the property on the embedded logic in isolation typically throws up a large number of counterexamples, many of which are spurious because the scenarios they depict are not possible in the entire logic. In this paper we introduce the notion of ranking the counterexamples so that only the most likely counterexamples are presented to the designer. Our ranking is based on assume properties mined from simulation traces of the entire logic. We define a metric to compute a belief for each assume property that is mined, and rank counterexamples based on their conflicts with the mined assume properties. Experimental results demonstrate an amazing correlation between the real counterexamples (if they exist) and the proposed ranking metric, thereby establishing the proposed method as a very promising verification approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176627","","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Computer bugs","embedded systems;formal verification;logic circuits;logic design","assumption mining;bug-fixing;counterexample ranking;embedded logic design;formal methods;formal verification property","","1","","20","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), and electromigration (EM) are some of the critical failure mechanisms affecting lifetime reliability. Due to the correlation between different failure mechanisms and their significant dependence on the operating temperature, existing models assuming constant failure rate and additive impact of failure mechanisms will underestimate the lifetime of a system, usually measured by mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). In this paper, we propose a new methodology which evaluates system lifetime in MTTF and relies on Monte-Carlo simulation for verifying results. Temperature variations and the correlation between failure mechanisms are considered so as to mitigate lifetime underestimation. The proposed methodology, when applied on an Alpha 21264 processor, provides less pessimistic lifetime evaluation than the existing models based on sum of failure rate. Our experimental results also indicate that, by considering the correlation of TDDB and NBTI, the lifetime of a system is likely not dominated by TDDB or NBTI, but by EM or other failure mechanisms.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176687","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176687","","Benchmark testing;Correlation;Equations;Failure analysis;Joints;Mathematical model;Reliability","Monte Carlo methods;electric breakdown;electromigration;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability","Alpha 21264 processor;Mitigating lifetime underestimation: A system-level approach considering temperature variations and correlations between failure mechanisms;Monte-Carlo simulation;NBTI;electromigration;lifetime reliability;mean-time-to-failure;negative bias temperature instability;time-dependent dielectric breakdown","","0","","25","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With multiple processor cores sharing the same caches, high-priority applications may end up contending with low-priority applications for cache space and suffer significant performance slow-down, hence affecting the Quality of Service (QoS). In datacenters, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) impose a reserved amount of computing resources and specific cache space per cloud customer. Thus, to meet SLAs, a deterministic capacity management solution is required to control the occupancy of all applications.

As a result, it combines the global perspective of minimum-cost flow approaches with the efficiency of local search algorithms. The tool is mainly designed to minimize total and maximum cell movement but it is flexible enough to optimize the effect on timing or netlength, too.

However, ignoring cache access patterns of concurrently executing applications sharing the local and remote partitions can cause inter-partition contention that reduces the overall instruction throughput. We propose a dynamic cache management scheme for LLC in NUCA-based architectures, which reduces inter-partition contention. Our proposed scheme provides efficient cache sharing by adapting migration, insertion, and promotion policies in response to the dynamic requirements of the individual applications with different cache access behaviors. Our adaptive cache management scheme allows individual cores to steal cache capacity from remote partitions to achieve better resource utilization.

To guarantee the overall success metric-driven verification flows have been developed. In these flows coverage metrics are omnipresent. Well established coverage metrics for simulation-based verification approaches exist. This is however not the case for formal verification where property checking is a major technique to prove the correctness of the implementation. In this paper we present a guiding coverage metric for this formal verification setting. Our metric reports a single number describing how much of the circuit behavior is uniquely determined by the properties. In addition, the coverage metric guides the verification engineer to achieve completeness by providing helpful information about missing scenarios. This information comes from a new behavior classification algorithm which determines uncovered behavior classes for a signal and allows to compute the coverage of a signal. To measure the complete circuit behavior we devise a coverage metric for a set of signals. The metric is calculated by partitioning the coverage computation into a safe part and an unsafe part where the latter one is weighted accordingly using recursion. This procedure takes into account that in practice properties refer to internal signals which in turn need to be covered them-self. Overall, our metric allows to track the verification progress in property checking and significantly aid the verification engineers in completing the property set.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176546","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling;Measurement;Memory management;Multiplexing;Upper bound","circuit analysis computing;formal verification;logic design;pattern classification","behavior classification algorithm;circuit behavior;circuit functional behavior;coverage computation partitioning;formal verification;guiding coverage metrics;metric-driven verification flows;property checking;simulation-based verification approaches;system functional behavior;uncovered behavior class determination;verification engineer","","1","","24","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, it proposes to apply a crossover filter to the power source and load profiles. The goal of this filtering technique is to allow the battery banks to stably (i.e., with low variation) receive energy from the power source and/or provide energy to the load device, while leaving the spiky (i.e., with high variation) power supply or demand to be dealt with by the supercapacitor banks. To maximize the HEES system cycle efficiency, a mathematical problem is formulated and solved to determine the optimal charging/discharging current profiles and charge transfer interconnect voltage, taking into account the power loss of the EES elements and power converters. To minimize the state of health (SoH) degradation of the battery array in the HEES system, we make use of two facts: the SoH of battery is better maintained if (i) the SoC swing is smaller, and (ii) the same SoC swing occurs at lower average SoC. Now then using the supercapacitor bank to deal with the high-frequency component of the power supply or demand, we can reduce the SoC swing for the battery array and lower the SoC of the array. A secondary helpful effect is that, for fixed and given amount of energy delivered to the load device, an improvement in the overall charge cycle efficiency of the HEES system translates into a further reduction in both the average SoC and the SoC swing of the battery array. The proposed charge management algorithm for a Li-ion battery - supercapacitor bank HEES system is simulated and compared to a homogeneous EES system comprised of Li-ion batteries only. Experimental results show significant performance enhancements for the HEES system, an increase of up to 21.9% and 4.82x in terms of the cycle efficiency and cycle life, respect- vely.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176652","charge management;hybrid electrical energy storage system;state of health","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Batteries;Degradation;Measurement;Supercapacitors;System-on-a-chip","battery management systems;lithium;secondary cells;supercapacitors","HEES system;Li;SoC;charging-discharging current profiles;crossover filter;efficient charge management algorithm;health aware charge management;high-frequency component;hybrid electrical energy storage systems;lithium-ion battery;power source;supercapacitor banks","","8","","19","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A HEES system is capable of providing an electrical energy storage means with very high performance by taking advantage of the strengths (while hiding the weaknesses) of individual EES elements used in the system. Charge migration is an operation by which electrical energy is transferred from a group of source EES elements to a group of destination EES elements. It is a necessary process to improve the HEES system's storage efficiency and its responsiveness to load demand changes. This paper is the first to formally describe a more general charge migration problem, involving multiple sources and multiple destinations. The multiple-source, multiple-destination charge migration optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem where the goal is to deliver a fixed amount of energy to the destination banks while maximizing the overall charge migration efficiency and not depleting the available energy resource of the source banks by more than a given percentage. The constraints for the optimization problem are the energy conservation relation and charging current constraints to ensure that charge migration will meet a given deadline. The formulation correctly accounts for the efficiency of chargers, the rate capacity effect of batteries, self-discharge currents and internal resistances of EES elements, as well as the terminal voltage variation of EES elements as a function of their state of charges (SoC's). An efficient algorithm to find a near-optimal migration control policy by effectively solving the above NLP optimization problem as a series of quasi-convex programming problems is presented. Experimental results show significant gain in migration efficiency up to 35%.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176455","charge management;charge migration;hybrid electrical energy storage system","Algorithm design and analysis;Batteries;Control systems;Optimization;Supercapacitors;System-on-a-chip","battery chargers;convex programming;energy conservation;energy resources;energy storage","HEES system storage efficiency;NLP optimization problem;charge transfer interconnection;destination banks;energy conservation relation;energy resource;heterogeneous electrical energy storage element;hybrid electrical energy storage system;individual EES element internal resistance;load demand;multiple destination charge migration efficiency;multiple source charge migration problem;multiple source multiple destination charge migration optimization problem;near-optimal migration control policy;nonlinear programming problem;optimization problem;quasiconvex programming problem;self-discharge current;terminal voltage variation","","2","","11","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It requires sophisticated multilevel hierarchies where private and shared caches coexist. It relies on hardware support to implicitly manage relaxed program order and write atomicity so as to provide well-defined shared-memory semantics (captured by the axioms of a memory consistency model) at the hardware-software interface. This paper addresses the problem of checking if an executable representation of the memory system complies with a specified consistency model. Conventional verification techniques encode the axioms as edges of a single directed graph, infer extra edges from memory traces, and indicate an error when a cycle is detected. Unlike them, we propose a novel technique that decomposes the verification problem into multiple instances of an extended bipartite graph matching problem. Since the decomposition was judiciously designed to induce independent instances, the target problem can be solved by a parallel verification algorithm. Our technique, which is proven to be complete for several memory consistency models, outperformed a conventional checker for a suite of 2400 randomly-generated use cases. On average, it found a higher percentage of faults (90%) as compared to that checker (69%) and did it, on average, 272 times faster.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176424","","Algorithm design and analysis;Coherence;Complexity theory;Hardware;Monitoring;Observability;Silicon","directed graphs;formal verification;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","ESL verification;conventional checker;extended bipartite graph matching problem;hardware-software interface;high-end embedded computing;memory consistency;memory consistency model;mobile computing;parallel verification algorithm;private cache;relaxed program order;shared cache;shared-memory semantics;single directed graph;system-on-chip multiprocessing;write atomicity","","2","","12","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The only generally applicable technique to model a static-order schedule in an SDFG is to convert it to a homogeneous SDFG (HSDFG). This conversion may lead to an exponential increase in the size of the graph and to sub-optimal analysis results (e.g., for buffer sizes in multi-processors).

Unfortunately, most of these tools are only optimizing the execution time by splitting up applications into concurrently executed tasks. In the domain of embedded devices, however, it is not sufficient to look only at this criterion. Since most of these devices are constraint-driven regarding execution time, energy consumption, heat dissipation and other objectives, a good trade-off has to be found to efficiently map applications to multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) devices. Therefore, we developed a fully automated multi-objective aware parallelization framework, which optimizes different objectives at the same time. The tool returns a Pareto-optimal front of solutions of the parallelized application to the designer, so that the solution with the best trade-off can be chosen.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176503","Automatic Parallelization;Embedded Software;Energy awareness;Genetic Algorithms;Multi-Objective;Task-Level Parallelism","Benchmark testing;Data mining;Energy consumption;Genetic algorithms;Image edge detection;Optimization;Parallel processing","Pareto optimisation;genetic algorithms;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;power aware computing;system-on-chip","MPSoC device;Pareto optimal front;automated multiobjective aware parallelization framework;constraint-driven execution time;embedded devices;energy consumption;genetic algorithm;heat dissipation;multiprocessor system on chip devices;task-level parallelism","","4","","23","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the limits of physics are preventing further scaling of speed, forcing a paradigm shift towards multicore computing and parallelization. In effect, the system is taking over the role that the single CPU was playing: high-speed signals running through chips but also packages and boards connect ever more complex systems. High-speed signals making their way through the entire system cause new challenges in the design of computing hardware. Inductance, phase shifts and velocity of light effects, material resonances, and wave behavior become not only prevalent but need to be calculated accurately and rapidly to enable short design cycle times. In essence, to continue scaling with Moore's Law requires the incorporation of Maxwell's equations in the design process. Incorporating Maxwell's equations into the design flow is only possible through the combined power that new algorithms, parallelization and high-speed computing provide. At the same time, incorporation of Maxwell-based models into circuit and system-level simulation presents a massive accuracy, passivity, and scalability challenge. In this tutorial, we navigate through the often confusing terminology and concepts behind field solvers, show how advances in field solvers enable integration into EDA flows, present novel methods for model generation and passivity assurance in large systems, and demonstrate the power of cloud computing in enabling the next generation of scalable Maxwell solvers and the next generation of Moore's Law scaling of systems.

The proposed thermal balancing technique uses an analytical model for forced convective heat transfer in microchannels, and has been applied to a two tier 3D-MPSoC.

The state-of-the-art logic encryption technique inserts gates randomly into the design [3] and does not necessarily ensure that wrong keys corrupt the outputs.

CACTI-3DD includes TSV models, improves models for 2D off-chip DRAM main memory over current versions of CACTI, and includes 3D integration models that enable the analysis of a full spectrum of 3D DRAM designs from coarse-grained rank-level 3D stacking to bank-level 3D stacking.

We demonstrate the utility of CACTI-3DD in analyzing design trade-offs of emerging 3D die-stacked DRAM main memories. We find that a coarse-grained 3D DRAM design that stacks canonical DRAM dies can only achieve marginal benefits in power, area, and timing compared to the original 2D design. To fully leverage the huge internal bandwidth of TSVs, DRAM dies must be re-architected, and system implications must be considered when building 3D DRAMs with redesigned 2D planar DRAM dies.

For the latter, an on-chip trust evaluation method is required. To this end, we present a general architecture for post-deployment trust evaluation based on on-chip classifiers. Specifically, we discuss the design of an on-chip analog neural network which can be trained to distinguish trusted from untrusted circuit functionality based on simple measurements obtained via on-chip measurement acquisition sensors. The proposed method is demonstrated using a Trojan-free and two Trojan infested variants of a wireless cryptographic IC design, as well as a fabricated programmable neural network experimentation chip.

We develop an analytical model for the error rate of SCSA to facilitate both design exploration and convergence.

We merge all individual paths from the Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) of the target applications, leading to a minimal set of required resources; this set is organized into a column of physical operators and cloned, thus generating a domain-specific rectangular lattice. A bus-based FPGA-style interconnection network is then generated and dimensioned to meet the needs of the applications.

Therefore, we proposed a compare and compress recovery architecture, consisting of a parallel run-length codec (PRLC) and a state table logic, to reduce the area of nonvolatile registers. Experimental results demonstrate that it can reduce the number of nonvolatile registers by 4 times with less than 1% overflow possibility, which leads to 43% overall processor area savings. Furthermore, we implemented the novel PRLC and defined the method to optimize the optimal parallel degree to accelerate the compressions. Finally, we proposed a reconfigurable state table architecture, which supports the reference vector selecting for different applications. With our heuristic vector selecting algorithm, the optimal vector can provide over 42% better register number reduction than other vector selecting approaches.

GIC is a Trojan-free IC which is required, in all existing HT frameworks, as a reference point to verify the responses obtained from an IC under authentication. However, identifying a GIC is not a trivial task. A GIC may not even exist, since all the fabricated ICs may be HT-infected. We propose a framework which is based on adding a set of detection sensors to a design which are integrated in the free spaces on the layout and fabricated on the same die. After fabrication, a self-authentication procedure is proposed in order to determine if a Trojan is inserted in a set of arbitrarily-selected paths in the design. The detection process uses on-chip measurements on the sensors and the design paths in order to evaluate the correlation between a set of actual and predicted delay ranges. Error in the on-chip measurement infrastructure is considered. If our framework determines that a Trojan is (or is not) inserted on a considered path, then it is accurate. In our computational experiments, conducted for challenging cases of small Trojan circuits in the presence of die-to-die and within-die process variations, we report a high detection rate to show its effectiveness in realizing a self-authentication process which is independent of a GIC.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176698","","Delay;Layout;Semiconductor device measurement;Sensors;System-on-a-chip;Trojan horses","integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit packaging","Trojan circuits;design path;detection sensors;die-to-die variation;hardware Trojan detection;on-chip measurement infrastructure;sensor-assisted self-authentication framework;within-die process variation","","2","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Debugging the erroneous interactions of events and state in a modern platform when things go wrong is hard enough on a VP; on a real platform (such as an emulator or FPGA-based prototype) it can become impossible unless a new level of sophistication is offered. The priority now is to ensure that the capabilities of these platforms meet the requirements of every application domain for electronics and software-based product design. And to ensure that all the use cases are satisfied.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract variation-aware and correlation-inclusive leakage power models for fast and accurate system-level analysis. For each individual module we generate a power model with different correlation information specified by the module vendor or customer. The local random variables in the power models are replaced by the corresponding ones at system level to reconstruct the correlation between modules so that the accuracy of system-level analysis is guaranteed.

There is a growing interest in using SDRAMs in safety critical application domains like aerospace, automotive and industrial automation. Some of these applications have hard real-time requirements where missing a deadline can have devastating consequence. Before integrating any hardware or software in this type of system it needs to be proven that deadlines will always be met. In practice, this is done by analyzing application's timing behavior and calculating its Worst Case Execution Time (WCET). SDRAMs have variable access latencies depending on the refresh operation and the previous accesses. This paper builds on hardware techniques such as bank interleaving and applying Priority Based Budget Scheduling (PBS) to share the SDRAM among multiple masters. Its main contribution is a technique to bound the WCET of an application accessing a shared SDRAM of a multicore architecture using the worst case access pattern.

Sometimes RDL is so congested that the capacity for routing is insufficient. Routing therefore cannot be completed within a single layer even for manual routing. Although [2] proposed a routing algorithm that uses two layers of RDLs, but in practice the required routing area is a little more than one layer. We overcome this problem by adopting the concept of pseudo single-layer. With the heuristics for routing on mapped channels and observations on staggered pins to relieve vertical constraints, the area of 2-layer routing can be minimized and the routability is 100%. Comparisons of routing results between manual design, the commercial tool, and the proposed method are presented. We have shown the effectiveness on a real industrial case: it originally required fully manual design, the proposed method can finish RDL routing automatically and effectively.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176727","","Routing;Substrates;Welding","flip-chip devices;network routing","2-layer routing;RDL routing;flip-chip design;flip-chip routing;mapped channels;peripheral IO placement;power distribution;pseudo single redistribution layer;redistribution layer;routing area","","1","","11","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Every component of the processor should be reconsidered to reduce wasted energy and area. Prefetching is an important technique for tolerating memory latency. Prefetcher designs have important impact on the energy efficiency of the memory hierarchy. Stride prefetchers require little storage, but cannot handle irregular access patterns. Delta correlation (DC) prefetchers can handle complicated access patterns, but waste storage because of storing multiple miss addresses for a stride pattern. Moreover, DC prefetchers waste the bandwidth and energy of the memory hierarchy because they cannot identify whether an address has been prefetched and generate a large number of redundant prefetches. In this paper, we propose a storage and energy efficient data prefetcher called stride/DC (S/DC) to combine the advantages of stride and DC prefetchers. S/DC uses a pattern prediction table (PPT) which stores two recent miss addresses in each entry to capture stride patterns. PPT avoids recording multiple miss addresses for a stride pattern, and thus improves the storage efficiency. When handling stride patterns, each PPT entry maintains a counter for obtaining the last prefetched address to avoid generating redundant prefetches. When handling other patterns, S/DC compares the new predicted address with earlier generated addresses in the prefetch queue and filters the redundant ones. In addition, to expand the filtering scope, S/DC uses a prefetch filter to store addresses evicted from the prefetch queue. In this way, S/DC reduces the bandwidth requirements and energy consumption of prefetching. Experimental results demonstrate that S/DC achieves comparable performance with only 24% of the storage and reduces 11.46% of the L2 cache energy, as compared to the CZone/DC prefetcher.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176515","","Bandwidth;Correlation;Energy efficiency;Filtering;Indexes;Prefetching;Radiation detectors","cache storage;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;storage management chips","CZone;DC prefetchers;L2 cache energy;S/DC;delta correlation prefetchers;energy efficient data prefetcher;irregular access patterns;memory hierarchy;memory latency;multiple miss addresses storage;pattern prediction table;prefetch queue;prefetcher designs;processor designs;storage efficient data prefetcher;stride pattern;stride prefetchers","","0","","18","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Memory hierarchies are efficiently optimized by performing code transformations prior to HLS in frameworks which exploit the linearity of the mapping functions between loop indexes and memory references (called linear kernels). Unfortunately, non-linear kernels are algorithms which do not benefit of such classical frameworks, because of the disparity of the non-linear functions to compute their memory references. In this paper we propose a method to design non-linear kernels in a HLS flow, which can be seen as a code pre-processing. The method starts from an algorithmic description and generates an enhanced algorithmic description containing both the non-linear kernel and an optimized memory hierarchy. The transformation and the associated optimization process provides a significant gain when compared to a standard optimization. Experiments on benchmarks show an average reduction of 28% of the external memory traffic and about 32 times of the embedded memory size.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176666","","Analytical models;Data models;Indium phosphide;Kernel;Optimization;Prefetching;System-on-a-chip","embedded systems;high level synthesis;memory architecture;storage management","HLS flow;HLS tools;RTL model;algorithmic description;code preprocessing;code transformations;embedded memory size;external memory traffic;hardware accelerator;high level synthesis flow;loop index;mapping function linearity;memory references;nonlinear kernel design;optimization process;optimized memory hierarchy","","0","","11","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, Inverted Temperature Dependence (ITD) is certainly the most unusual. It manifests itself as a speed up of CMOS gates when the temperature increases, resulting in a reversal of the worst-case condition, i.e., CMOS gates show the largest delay at low temperatures. On the other hand, for metal interconnects an high temperature still holds as worst case condition. The two contrasting behaviors may invalidate the results obtained through standard design flow which do not consider temperature as an explicit variable in their optimizations. In this paper we focus on the impact of ITD on clock distribution networks (CDN), whose function is vital to guarantee the synchronization among physically spaced sequential components of digital circuits.

This paper proposes an incremental system-level synthesis framework that tightly integrates behavioral synthesis of modules into the layer assignment and floorplan- ning stage of 3D IC design. Behavioral synthesis is implemented as a sub-routine to be called to adjust delay/power/variability/area of circuit modules during the physical planning process.

To guarantee that the system works as intended, the memory controller must be configured such that all the real-time requirements of all sharing applications are satisfied. The attainable worst-case bandwidth, latency, and power of the memory depend largely on memory map configuration. Sharing SDRAM amongst multiple applications is challenging, since their requirements might call for different memory maps. This paper presents an exploration of the memory-map design space. Two contributions improve the memory-map selection procedure. The first contribution reduces the minimum access granularity by interleaving requests over a configurable number of banks instead of all banks. This technique is beneficial for worst-case performance in terms of bandwidth, latency and power.

Wide area connectivity between such geographically distributed data centers has an important role to ensure both the quality of service, and, as bandwidths increase to 100Gbps and beyond, as an efficient way to dynamically distribute the computation. The energy cost of data transmission is dominated by the router power consumption, which is unfortunately not energy proportional. In this paper we not only quantify the performance benefits of leveraging the network to run more jobs, but also analyze its energy impact. We compare the benefits of redesigning routers to be more energy efficient to those obtained by leveraging locally available green energy as a complement to the brown energy supply. Furthermore, we design novel green energy aware routing policies for wide area traffic and compare to state-of-the-art shortest path routing algorithm. Our results indicate that using energy proportional routers powered in part by green energy along with our new routing algorithm results in 10x improvement in per router energy efficiency with 36% average increase in the number of jobs completed.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176458","energy proportional;green energy;network;routing","Bandwidth;Energy efficiency;Gears;Green products;Power demand;Routing;Servers","computer centres;data communication;power aware computing;power consumption;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","brown energy supply;computational demand;data transmission;energy impact analysis;energy proportional;geographically distributed data centers;green energy aware routing policies;green energy benefits;high speed wide area networks;quality of service;router energy efficiency;router power consumption;state-of-the-art shortest path routing algorithm;wide area traffic","","7","","38","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The calculation of depth information and Motion Estimation can be considered as two fundamental image processing applications in these systems, which have already been evaluated in diverse research scenarios. However, in order to push these computation-intensive features towards series integration, future in-vehicle implementations must adhere to the automotive industry's strict power consumption and cost constraints. As an answer to this challenge, this paper presents a high-performance FPGA-based dense block matching solution, which enables the calculation of both object motion and the extraction of depth information on shared hardware resources. This novel single-design approach significantly reduces the amount of logic resources required, resulting in valuable cost and power savings. The acquired sensor information can be fusioned into 3D positions with an associated 3D motion vector, which enables a robust perception of the vehicle's environment. The modular implementation offers enhanced configuration features at design and execution time and achieves up to 418 GOPS at a moderate energy consumption of 10 Watts, providing a flexible solution for a future series integration.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176475","","Arrays;Automotive engineering;Cameras;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Vehicles","cameras;computer vision;driver information systems;field programmable gate arrays;image matching;image motion analysis;sensor fusion","3D motion vector;3D positions;FPGA-based dense block matching solution;acquired sensor information;automotive 6D-vision;automotive industry;automotive manufacturers;camera-based driver assistance systems;computation-intensive features;cost constraints;depth information;high-performance dense block matching solution;image processing applications;in-vehicle implementations;motion estimation;power consumption constraints;series integration;shared hardware resources","","1","","12","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, today's digital microfluidic biochips suffer from the drawback that there is no feedback to the control software from the underlying hardware platform. Due to the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments, errors are likely during droplet manipulation, but error recovery based on the repetition of experiments leads to wastage of expensive reagents and hard-to-prepare samples. By exploiting recent advances in the integration of optical detectors (sensors) in a digital microfluidics biochip, we present a “physical-aware” system reconfiguration technique that uses sensor data at checkpoints to dynamically reconfigure the biochip. A re-synthesis technique is used to recompute electrode-actuation sequences, thereby deriving new schedules, module placement, and droplet routing pathways, with minimum impact on the time-to-response.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176682","","Arrays;Electrodes;Optical detectors;Schedules;Software","lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics;optical sensors","biochemical experiments;cyberphysical synthesis approach;digital microfluidic biochips;droplet manipulation;droplet routing pathways;droplet-based digital microfluidic technology;electrode-actuation sequences;error recovery;healthcare applications;module placement;optical detectors;physical-aware system reconfiguration technique;resynthesis technique;sensors;software-controlled biochips","","11","","23","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to pre- and post-conditions, they represent global constraints. That is, they are harder to explicitly consider and, thus, become disadvantageous when the design process approaches the implementation phase. As a consequence, they should be removed from a design when it comes to an implementation. However, so far only naïve tool support aiding the designer in this task is available. In this paper, we present an approach which addresses this problem. A methodology is proposed which iteratively removes invariants from a model and, afterwards, presents the designer with invalid scenarios originally prevented by the just eliminated invariant. Using this, the designer can either manually modify the model or simply take the automatically generated suggestion. This enables to entirely eliminate all invariants without changing the semantics of the model. Case studies illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176669","","Computational modeling;Context;Object oriented modeling;Semantics;Switches;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language","UML/OCL models;global constraints;implementation phase;naïve tool support;unified modeling language","","1","","9","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"AFRA: A low cost high performance reliable routing for 3D mesh NoCs","Akbari, S.; Shafiee, A.; Fathy, M.; Berangi, Reza","Sch. of Comput.

Such networks have shorter communication hop count, compared to 2D NoCs, and enjoy fast and power efficient TSV wires in vertical links. Unfortunately, the fabrication process of TSV connections has not matured yet, which results in poor vertical links yield. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce AFRA, a deadlock-free routing algorithm for 3D mesh-based NoCs that tolerates faults on vertical links. AFRA is designed to be simple, high performance, and robust. The simplicity is achieved by applying ZXY and XZXY routings in the absence and presence of fault, respectively. Furthermore, AFRA, as will be proved, is deadlock-free when all vertical faulty links have the same direction. This enables the routing to save virtual channels for performance rather than scarifying them for deadlock avoidance. Finally, AFRA provides robustness, which means supporting connection for all possible pairs of communicating nodes in high fault rates. AFRA is evaluated, though cycle accurate network simulation, and is compared with planar adaptive routing. Results reveal that AFRA significantly outperforms planar adaptive routing in both synthetic and real traffic patterns. In addition, the robustness of AFRA is calculated analytically.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176490","","Adaptation models;Circuit faults;Reliability;Routing;System recovery;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","network routing;network-on-chip;three-dimensional integrated circuits;wires","2D NoC;3D mesh NoC;AFRA;XZXY routings;cycle accurate network simulation;fault rates;high-density 3D many-core IC;low cost high performance reliable routing;planar adaptive routing;power efficient TSV wires;three-dimensional mesh network-on-chips;vertical links;virtual channels","","8","","20","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the problem of formal verification of hardware implementations of (modulo) multipliers over Galois fields of the type F<sub>(2k)</sub>, using a computer-algebra/algebraic-geometry based approach. The multiplier circuit is modeled as a polynomial system in F<sub>(2k)</sub>[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... , x<sub>d</sub>] and the verification problem is formulated as a membership test in a corresponding (radical) ideal. This requires the computation of a Gröbner basis, which can be computationally intensive. To overcome this limitation, we analyze the circuit topology and derive a term order to represent the polynomials. Subsequently, using the theory of Gröbner bases over Galois fields, we prove that this term order renders the set of polynomials itself a Gröbner basis of this ideal - thus significantly improving verification. Using our approach, we can verify the correctness of, and detect bugs in, upto 163-bit circuits in F<sub>(2163)</sub>; whereas contemporary approaches are infeasible.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176625","","Boolean functions;Computer bugs;Data structures;Elliptic curve cryptography;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Polynomials","Galois fields;digital arithmetic;formal verification;multiplying circuits;network topology;polynomials;process algebra","163-bit circuits;Galois field arithmetic;Galois field multiplier;Grobner basis reductions;algebraic geometry-based approach;bug detection;circuit topology;computer algebra-based approach;formal verification;multiplier circuit modeling;multiplier hardware implementation;polynomial system","","3","","24","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The prediction challenge is mainly due to limited access for direct delay measurement on the design paths after fabrication, combined with the high degree of variability in the process and environmental factors. Our framework is based on using on-chip delay sensors to improve timing prediction. Given a placed netlist at the pre-silicon stage, an optimization procedure is described which automatically generates the sensors subject to an area budget and available whitespace on the layout, in the presence of process variations. Each sensor is then generated as a sequence of logic gates with an approximate location on the layout at the pre-silicon stage. The on-chip sensor delay is then measured to predict the delays of individual design paths with less pessimism. In our experiments, we show that custom on-chip sensors can significantly increase the rate of predicting if a specified set of paths are failing their timing requirements.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176726","","Delay;Equations;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Optimization;Sensors","elemental semiconductors;logic gates;optimisation;sensors;silicon","Si;custom on-chip sensors;direct delay measurement;environmental factors;logic gates;optimization procedure;post-silicon delay characterization;post-silicon failing path isolation;post-silicon validation characterization","","3","","12","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact makes them vulnerable to attacks. On the other hand, Self-Timed Rings (STR) are currently considered as a promising solution to generate robust clock signals. Although many studies deal with their temporal behavior and robustness in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), equivalent study does not exist for FPGAs. Furthermore, these oscillators were not analyzed and characterized as entropy sources aimed at TRNG design. In this paper, we analyze STRs as entropy sources for TRNGs implemented in FPGAs. Next, we compare STRs and IROs when serving as sources of randomness. We show that STRs represent very interesting alternative to IROs: they are more robust to environmental fluctuations and they exhibit lower extra-device frequency variations.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176697","","Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency measurement;Jitter;Oscillators;Propagation delay;Robustness;Voltage measurement","application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;jitter;oscillators;random number generation","ASIC;FPGA;IRO;STR;TRNG;application specific integrated circuits;entropy sources;inverter ring oscillators;jittery clocks;self-timed ring;true random number generators","","3","","7","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For controller synthesis, a controller is modeled as a player while the environment, or plant, is modeled as the opponent player (adversary). Synthesizing an optimal controller that satisfies a given criterion corresponds to finding a winning strategy for the controller player. Emerging streaming applications (audio, video, communication, etc.) for embedded systems exhibit both input sensitive and controller sensitive runtime behavior, where the controller's role is runtime management or scheduling. Embedded controllers need to be optimized for dynamic inputs, while guaranteeing throughput constraints. In this paper, we consider this design task for scenario- and resource-aware dataflow graphs that model streaming applications. Scenarios in these models capture classes of dynamic environment behavior.

The performance of logic simulators, however, is not sufficient to attain acceptable verification coverage on large industrial designs within the time-frame available. Acceleration platforms are a valuable addition to the verification effort in that they can provide much higher coverage in less time. Unfortunately, these platforms do not provide the rich checking capability of software-based simulation. We propose a novel solution to deploy those complex checkers, typical of simulation-based environments, onto acceleration platforms. To this end, checkers must be transformed into synthesizable, compact logic blocks with bug-detection capabilities similar to that of their software counterparts. Our “approximate checkers” trade off logic complexity with bug detection accuracy by leveraging novel techniques to approximate complex software checkers into small synthesizable hardware blocks, which can be simulated along with the design on an acceleration platform.

Moore's Law continues to deliver ever-more transistors on an integrated circuit, but discontinuities in the progress of technology mean that the future isn't simply an extrapolation of the past. For example, design cost and complexity constraints have recently caused the microprocessor industry to switch to multi-core architectures, even though these parallel machines present programming challenges that are far from solved. Moore's Law now translates into ever-more processors on a multi-, and soon many-core chip. The software challenge is compounded by the need for increasing fault-tolerance as near-atomic-scale variability and robustness problems bite harder. We look beyond this transitional phase to a future where the availability of processor resource is effectively unlimited and computations must be optimised for energy usage rather than load balancing, and we look to biology for examples of how such systems might work.

Therefore, this paper presents a block-level flash memory management scheme, WAB-FTL, to effectively manage NAND flash memory while reducing write activities of the PCM-based embedded systems. The basic idea is to preserve each bit in flash mapping table hosted by PCM from being inverted frequently during the process of mapping table update. To achieve this, a new merge strategy is adopted in WAB-FTL to delay the mapping table update, and a tiny mapping buffer is used for caching frequently updated mapping records.

This paper tackles the TTNoC scheduling problem and presents an approach based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving. We first formulate the complete problem as an SMT instance, which can always compute a feasible solution if exists.

The complexity of large systems is dealt with by partitioning the system into manageable subblocks that are modeled separately. These models are then evaluated to obtain the system specifications. However, highly expensive reliability simulations, combined with nonlinear output behavior and the high dimensionality of the problem is still a very challenging task. Therefore the use of fast function extraction symbolic regression (FFX) is proposed. This allows to capture the high-dimensional nonlinear problem with good accuracy. Also, an active learning sample selection algorithm is introduced to minimize the amount of expensive aging simulations. The algorithm trades of space exploration with function nonlinearity detection and model uncertainty reduction to select optimal model training samples. The simulation method is demonstrated on a 6 bit Flash ADC, designed in a 32nm CMOS technology.

When processing computation intensive kernels, multiple FGRAs may be used to execute a complex function. In order to exploit the adaptivity of a fine-grained reconfigurable fabric, a runtime system should decide when and which FGRAs to reconfigure with respect to application requirements. To enable this adaptivity, a flexible infrastructure is required that allows combining FGRAs to execute complex functions. We propose a mixed-grained reconfigurable architecture composed from a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Infrastructure (CGRI) that connects the FGRAs. At runtime we synthesize CGRI configurations that depend on decisions of the runtime system, e.g. which FGRAs shall be reconfigured. Synthesis and place & route of the FGRAs are done at compile time for performance reasons. Combined, this results in a partial online synthesis for mixed grained reconfigurable architectures, which allows maintaining a low runtime overhead while exploiting the inherent adaptivity of the reconfigurable fabric. In this work we focus on the crucial parts of synthesizing the configurations for the CGRI at runtime, propose algorithms, and compare their performance/overhead trade-offs for different application scenarios. We are the first to exploit the increased adaptivity of FGRAs that are connected by a CGRI, by using our partial online synthesis.

In this paper, we propose an error-resilient architecture for Context-Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) in H.264/AVC. Due to its context-adaptive nature and intricate control flow CAVLC is very sensitive to soft errors. An error during the CAVLC process (especially during the context adaptation or in VLC tables) may result in severe mismatch between encoder and decoder. The primary goal in our error-resilient CAVLC architecture is to protect codeword/codelength tables and context adaptation in a reliable yet power efficient manner. For reducing the power over-head, the tables are partitioned in various sub-tables each protected with variable-sized parity. Moreover, for further power reduction, our approach incorporates state-retentive power-gating of different sub-tables at run time depending upon the statistical distribution of syntax elements. Compared to the unprotected case, our scheme provides a video quality improvement of 18dB (averaged over various fault injection cases and video sequences) at the cost of a 35% area overhead and 45% performance overhead due to the error-detection logic. However, partitioned sub-tables increase the potential for power-gating, thus bring a leakage energy saving of 58%. Compared to state-of-the-art table protection, our scheme provides 2x reduced area and performance overhead. For function-al verification and area comparison, the architecture is prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, though not limited to it.

In mobile systems running both real-time and non-real-time applications, the memory configuration must satisfy bandwidth requirements of real-time applications, meet the power consumption budget, and offer the best average-case execution time to the non-real-time applications. There is currently no well-defined methodology for selecting a suitable memory configuration for real-time mobile systems. The worst-case bandwidth, average-case execution time, and power consumption of mobile DRAMs across generations have furthermore not been investigated. This paper has two main contributions. 1) We analyze the worst-case bandwidth, average-case execution time, and power consumption of mobile DRAMs across three generations: LPDDR, LPDDR2 and Wide-IO-based 3D-stacked DRAM. 2) Based on our analysis, we propose a methodology for selecting memory configurations in real-time mobile systems.We show that LPDDR (32-bit IO), LPDDR2 (32-bit IO) and 3D-DRAM (128-bit IO) provide worst-case bandwidth up to 0.75 GB/s, 1.6 GB/s and 3.1 GB/s, respectively.

Source-level simulation models can be easily integrated into SystemC based simulation environment for fast simulation of complex multiprocessor systems. The accurate back-annotation of the timing information relies on the mapping between source code and binary code. The compiler optimizations might make it hard to get accurate mapping information. This paper addresses the mapping problems caused by complex compiler optimizations, which are the main source of simulation errors. To obtain accurate mapping information, we propose a method called fine-grained flow mapping that establishes a mapping between sequences of control flow of source code and binary code. In case that the code structure of a program is heavily altered by compiler optimizations, we propose to replace the altered part of the source code with functionally-equivalent IR-level code which has an optimized structure, leading to Partly Optimized Source Code (POSC). Then the flow mapping can be established between the POSC and the binary code and the timing information is back-annotated to the POSC.

A key drawback of PCMs is limited write endurance. To address this problem, several static wear-leveling methods that change logical to physical address mapping periodically have been proposed. Although these methods have low space overhead, they suffer from unnecessary data migrations thereby failing to exploit the full lifetime potential of PCMs. This paper proposes a new dynamic wear-leveling method that reduces unnecessary data migrations by adopting a hot/cold swapping-based dynamic method. Compared with the conventional hot/cold swapping-based dynamic method, the proposed method requires only a small amount of space overhead by applying Bloom filters to the identification of hot and cold data. We simulate our method using SPEC2000 benchmark traces and compare with previous methods.

It is shown that for W<sub>FET</sub> less than a critical value (~7 times the minimum feature length), one-finger transistor yields minimum cell area. For large W<sub>FET</sub>, minimum cell area is achieved with a two-finger transistor. We also show that for a range of W<sub>FET</sub>, the cell area is limited by the metal pitch of bit- and source-lines. As a result, in the metal pitch limited (MPL) region, W<sub>FET</sub> can be increased with no change in the cell area. We analyze the impact of increase in W<sub>FET</sub> in the MPL region on the write margin and cell tunneling magneto-resistance (CTMR) of different genres of STT MRAMs. We consider conventional STT MRAM cells in the standard and reverse-connected configurations and STT MRAMs with tilted magnetic anisotropy for the analysis. By increasing W<sub>FET</sub> from the minimum to the maximum value in the MPL region (at iso-cell area) and reducing read voltage to achieve iso-read disturb margin, 2X improvement in write margin and 27% improvement in CTMR is achieved for the reverse-connected STT MRAM.

Each policy has different requirements (e.g., power, fault-tolerance) and is exploited by our dynamic memory management module (VaMVisor), which adapts to the underlying hardware, prioritizes the memory resources according to their characteristics (e.g., power consumption), and selectively maps data to the best-fitting memory resource (e.g., high-utilization data to low-power memory space). Our experimental results on embedded benchmarks show that VaMV is capable of reducing dynamic power consumption by 63% on average while reducing total execution time by an average of 34% by exploiting: 1) SRAM voltage scaling, 2) DRAM power variability, and 3) Efficient dynamic policy-driven variability-aware memory allocation.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176479","","Dynamic scheduling;Hardware;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Resource management;System-on-a-chip","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtual storage","DRAM power variability;SRAM voltage scaling;VaMV;VaMVisor;application address space;best-fitting memory resource;dynamic memory management module;dynamic policy-driven variability-aware memory allocation;dynamic power consumption reduction;execution time reduction;mapping policy;off-chip DRAM;on-chip SRAM;power consumption variability;variability-aware memory virtualization;virtual address region","","5","","24","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our study, we investigate the feasibility and issues of applying a real PCM to main memory. In this paper, we report our case study of characterizing the PCM and evaluating its usefulness in the main memory. Our results show that the PCM/DRAM hybrid main memory with a modest DRAM size can give comparable performance to that of the DRAM only main memory.

Resource sharing, however, introduces new timing interdependencies between system components, which must be analyzed to verify that the initial timing requirements of the application domain are still met. Graphs with synchronous dataflow (SDF) semantics are frequently used to model these systems. In this paper, we present a method to integrate resource sharing into SDF graphs. Using these graphs and a throughput constraint, we will derive deadlines for resource accesses and the amount of memory required for an implementation. Then we derive the resource load directly from the SDF description, and perform a formal schedulability analysis to check if the original timing constraints are still met.

In order to be commercially viable, the assembly yield for 3D-stacked ICs must be as high as possible, requiring TSVs to be reparable. Existing techniques typically assume TSV faults to be uniformly distributed and use neighboring TSVs to repair faulty ones, if any. In practice, however, clustered TSV faults are quite common due to the fact that the TSV bonding quality depends on surface roughness and cleaness of silicon dies, rendering prior TSV redundancy solutions less effective. To resolve this problem, we present a novel TSV repair framework, including a hardware architecture that enables faulty TSVs to be repaired by redundant TSVs that are farther apart, and the corresponding repair algorithm. By doing so, the manufacturing yield for 3D-stacked ICs can be dramatically improved, as demonstrated in our experimental results.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176602","","Circuit faults;Clustering algorithms;Joining processes;Maintenance engineering;Redundancy;Through-silicon vias;Timing","three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D-stacked IC;TSV bonding quality;TSV redundancy solutions;TSV repair framework;clustered TSV faults;hardware architecture;semiconductor industry;silicon die cleaness;surface roughness;through-silicon vias","","26","","27","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper considers challenges and opportunities in identifying this variation and methods to combat it for improved computing systems. We introduce the notion of instruction-level vulnerability (ILV) to expose variation and its effects to the software stack for use in architectural/compiler optimizations. To compute ILV, we quantify the effect of voltage and temperature variations on the performance and power of a 32-bit, RISC, in-order processor in 65 nm TSMC technology at the level of individual instructions.

New techniques are needed to shorten time-to-market and to reduce the cost of producing a correct analog integrated circuit. Model order reduction is an approach used to reduce the computational complexity of the mathematical model of a dynamical system, while capturing its main features. This technique can be used to reduce an analog circuit model while retaining its realistic behavior. In this paper, we present an approach to model order reduction of nonlinear analog circuits. We model the circuit using fuzzy differential equations and use qualitative simulation and K-means clustering to discretion efficiently its state space. Moreover, we use a conformance checking approach to refine model order reduction steps and guarantee simulation acceleration and accuracy. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to a transmission line with nonlinear diodes and a large nonlinear ring oscillator circuit. Experimental results show that our reduced models are more than one order of magnitude faster and accurate when compared to existing methods.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176699","","Analog circuits;Computational modeling;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Transient analysis;Vectors","analogue integrated circuits;computational complexity;differential equations;fuzzy set theory;integrated circuit modelling;pattern clustering;semiconductor diodes","K-means clustering;analog integrated circuit model;computational complexity;cost reduction;fuzzy differential equations;mathematical model;model order reduction;model order reduction steps;nonlinear analog circuits;nonlinear diodes;nonlinear ring oscillator circuit;qualitative simulation;time-to-market;transmission line","","2","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large fraction of the traffic originates not from data messages exchanged between sharing cores, but from the communication between the cores and intermediate hardware structures (i.e., directories) for the purpose of maintaining coherence in the presence of conflicting updates. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Directories, a method allowing the directories to be placed arbitrarily in the chip by piggy-backing the virtual to physical address translation. This eliminates a large fraction of the on-chip interconnect traversals, hence reducing the power consumption. Through trace-driven and cycle-accurate simulation in a range of scientific and Map-Reduce applications, we show that our technique reduces the power and energy expended by the on-chip interconnect by up to 37% (16.4% on average) with negligible hardware overhead and a small improvement in performance (1.3% on average).","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176456","Multicore architecture;Non-uniform caches;On-chip networks","Coherence;Integrated circuit interconnections;Multicore processing;Principal component analysis;System-on-a-chip;Tiles","cache storage;cores;integrated circuit modelling;network-on-chip;power integrated circuits","chip overall power consumption;cycle-accurate simulation;data messages;dynamic directories;map-reduce applications;multicores;piggy-backing;reducing on-chip interconnect power;through trace-driven","","4","","21","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the TLM 2.0 standard based on OSCI SystemC, a single transaction can transfer a large data block. Due to such high abstraction, a great amount of information becomes invisible and thus timing accuracy can be degraded heavily. We present a methodology to accurately time such block transactions and achieve high simulation performance at the same time. First, before abstraction, a profiling process is performed on an instruction set simulator (ISS). Driver functions that implement the transfer of the data blocks are simulated. Several techniques are employed to trace the exact start and end of the driver functions as well as HW usages. Thus, a profile library of those driver functions can be constructed. Then, the application programs are host-compiled and use a single transaction to transfer a data block. A strategy is presented that efficiently estimates the timing of block transactions based on the profile library. It is the first method that takes into account caching effects that influence the timing of block transactions. Moreover, it ensures overall timing accuracy when integrated in other SW timing tools for full system simulation. Experimental results show that the block transactions are accurately timed, with average error less than 1%. At the same time, the simulation gain can be up to three orders of magnitude.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176446","","Cameras;Estimation error;Libraries;Time domain analysis;Time varying systems;Timing","C language;device drivers;instruction sets;software libraries;virtual prototyping","HW usages;OSCI SystemC;SW timing tools;TLM 2.0 standard;accurately timed transaction level models;block transactions;driver functions;high abstraction level;instruction set simulator;profile library;virtual prototyping","","2","","13","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reports on the application of Interactive Markov Chains (IMC) to capture SADF and to formally verify functional and performance properties. To this end, we propose a compositional IMC semantics for SADF based on which the Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes (CADP) tool suite enables model checking various properties. Encountered challenges included dealing with probabilistic choice and potentially unbounded buffers, both of which are not natively supported, as well as a fundamental difference in the underlying time models of SADF and IMC.

The architecture uses a single-cycle mesh of tree as the interconnection network between processors and a unified Tightly Coupled Data Memory (TCDM). The proposed technique is able to compensate the effect of process variation on processor to memory paths. By adding one stage of controllable pipeline on the processor to memory paths we are able to switch between two modes: with and without pipeline. If there is no variation, the processor to memory path is fully combination and we have single-cycle read and write operations. If the variation occurs, the controllable pipeline is switched to pipeline mode and by increasing the latency of the read/write operation we mitigate the effect of the variations. We also propose a configuration-time approach to conditionally add the extra pipeline state based on detection of timing-critical paths. Experimental results show that our speed adaptation approach is able to compensate up-to 90% degradation in the request path with less than 1% hardware overhead for a shared-Ll CMP with 16 processors and 32 memory banks.

In this paper, we adopt the Importance Sampling (IS) based information theory inspired Minimum Cross Entropy method, to propose a general technique to quickly evaluate the failure probability of SRAM cells. In particular, we first mathematically formulate the failure of SRAM cells such that the concept of `Cross Entropy Distance' can be leveraged, and the distance between the ideal distribution for IS and the practical distribution for IS (which is used for generating samples), is well-defined. This cross entropy distance is now minimized resulting in a simple analytical solution to obtain the optimal practical distribution for IS, thereby expediting the convergence of estimation. The experimental results of a commercial 45nm SRAM cell demonstrate that for the same accuracy, the proposed method yields computational savings on the order of 17~50X over the existing state-of-the-art techniques.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176467","","Accuracy;Entropy;Equations;Mathematical model;Minimization;Random access memory;Vectors","SRAM chips;failure analysis;integrated circuit reliability","SRAM failure rate;computational savings;cross entropy distance;failure probability;importance smpling;mnimum cross entropy minimization;process variations;size 45 nm","","1","","13","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose an application-specific partitioned cache architecture in which a cache is organized as a set of independently addressable sub-blocks; by properly using the idleness of the various banks to drive how the partition is determined, it is possible to extend the effective lifetime of the cache while saving extra energy. Two are the distinctive features of our approach: First, we allow the cache sub-blocks age at different rates, achieving a sort of graceful degradation of performance while extending lifetime beyond the limits of previously published works. Proper architectural arrangements are also introduced in order to cope with the issue of using a progressively smaller cache. Second, the sub-blocks have non-uniform sizes, so to maximally exploit idleness for joint energy and aging optimization. Simulation results show that it is possible to extend the effective lifetime of the cache by more than 2x with respect to previous methods, while concurrently improving energy consumption by about 50%.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176498","","Aging;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Indexing;Measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","cache storage;power aware computing","aging optimization;application-specific memory partitioning;application-specific partitioned cache architecture;energy consumption;idle cache line;independently addressable subblock;joint energy optimization;lifetime optimization;negative bias temperature instability;power management","","2","","19","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Energy-efficient branch prediction with Compiler-guided History Stack","Mingxing Tan; Xianhua Liu; Zichao Xie; Dong Tong; Xu Cheng","Microprocessor R&D Center, Peking Univ., Beijing, China","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2012","20120403","2012","","","449","454","Branch prediction is critical in exploring instruction level parallelism for modern processors. Previous aggressive branch predictors generally require significant amount of hardware storage and complexity to pursue high prediction accuracy. This paper proposes the Compiler-guided History Stack (CHS), an energy-efficient compiler-microarchitecture cooperative technique for branch prediction. The key idea is to track very-long-distance branch correlation using a low-cost compiler-guided history stack. It relies on the compiler to identify branch correlation based on two program substructures: loop and procedure, and feed the information to the predictor by inserting guiding instructions. At runtime, the processor dynamically saves and restores the global history using a low-cost history stack structure according to the compiler-guided information. The modification on the global history enables the predictor to track very-long-distance branch correlation and thus improves the prediction accuracy. We show that CHS can be combined with most of existing branch predictors and it is especially effective with small and simple predictors. Our evaluations show that the CHS technique can reduce the average branch mispredictions by 28.7% over gshare predictor, resulting in average performance improvement of 10.4%. Furthermore, it can also improve those aggressive perceptron, OGEHL and TAGE predictors.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176513","","","power aware computing;program compilers","CHS;branch correlation;compiler guided history stack;compiler guided information;compiler microarchitecture;distance branch correlation;energy efficient branch prediction;hardware complexity;hardware storage;history stack structure;instruction level parallelism","","1","","24","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NBTI is strongly dependent on the input vector. Moreover, a considerable fraction of execution time of an application is spent to execute NOP (No Operation) instructions. Based on these observations, we present a novel NOP assignment to minimize NBTI effect, i.e. maximum NBTI relaxation, on the processors. Our analysis shows that NBTI degradation is more impacted by the source operands rather than instruction opcodes. Given this, we obtain the instruction, along with the operands, with minimal NBTI degradation, to be used as NOP. We also proposed two methods, software-based and hardware-based, to replace the original NOP with this maximum aging reduction NOP. Experimental results based on SPEC2000 applications running on a MIPS processor show that this method can extend the lifetime by 37% in average while the overhead is negligible.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176465","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176465","","Degradation;Delay;Hazards;Logic gates;Program processors;Registers;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;ageing;integrated circuit reliability","CMOS technology;MIPS processor;NBTI degradation;NBTI mitigation;NBTI relaxation;NOP assignment;instruction opcodes;maximum aging reduction NOP;negative bias temperature instability mitigation;optimized NOP assignment;optimized NOP insertion","","8","","18","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Non-preemptive scheduling is obviously not subject to any preemption delay but its schedulability may be quite poor, whereas fully preemptive scheduling is subject to preemption delay, but benefits from a higher flexibility in the scheduling decisions. The time-delay involved by task preemptions is a major source of pessimism in the analysis of the task Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) in real-time systems. Preemptive scheduling policies including non-preemptive regions are a hybrid solution between non-preemptive and fully preemptive scheduling paradigms, which enables to conjugate both world's benefits. In this paper, we exploit the connection between the progression of a task in its operations, and the knowledge of the preemption delays as a function of its progression. The pessimism in the preemption delay estimation is then reduced in comparison to state of the art methods, due to the increase in information available in the analysis.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176520","","Computational modeling;Delay estimation;Estimation;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Real time systems","delay estimation;processor scheduling;real-time systems","floating nonpreemptive region scheduling;preemption delay analysis;preemption delay estimation;preemptive scheduling policies;real-time systems;task preemptions;time-delay;unicore systems;worst-case execution time","","2","","13","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the power consumption of existing tuning methods to properly calibrate the optical devices would be prohibitively high. We propose two calibration and reconfiguration techniques that can significantly reduce the worst case tuning power of a ring-resonator-based optical modulator: 1) a channel re-mapping scheme, with sub-channel redundant resonators, which results in significant reduction in the amount of required tuning, typically within the capability of voltage based tuning, and 2) a dynamic feedback calibration mechanism used to compensate for both process and thermal variations of the resonators. Simulation results demonstrate that these techniques can achieve a 48X reduction in tuning power - less than 10W for a network with 1-million ring resonators.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176711","","Calibration;Detectors;Modulation;Optical ring resonators;Optical waveguides;Tuning","calibration;optical communication;optical resonators","channel remapping scheme;dynamic feedback calibration mechanism;next-generation high performance multicore systems;on-chip optical communication infrastructure;optical devices;power consumption;power-efficient calibration;ring-resonator-based optical modulator:;subchannel redundant resonators;thermal variation;tuning methods","","0","","27","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study a switching scheme where control messages are dynamically scheduled between the time-triggered and the event-triggered slots. This allows more efficient use of time-triggered slots which are often scarce and therefore should be used sparingly. Our focus is to perform a schedulability analysis for this setup, i.e., in the event of an external disturbance, can a message be switched from an event-triggered to a time-triggered slot within a specified deadline?

About 100 ECU's with more than 7.000 semiconductor components realize safety, comfort and powertrain functions. These numbers will increase drastically when going the step from the conventional vehicle to the e-car, where a lot more functions have to be realized just by electronics. Finally the functionality has to be guaranteed in one of the harshest environments where electronics are used with a target of 0 ppm concerning the subcomponents for the 15 years lifetime of the car. We give an overview of the challenges on the way to reach this target. The task of getting to a high level of robustness and quality within short maturing periods of new technologies and semiconductor products are discussed. Using state-of-the-art semiconductor process technologies for devices in a car is necessary to fulfill today's performance requirements and even more future requirements with respect to the e-car. But it leads to a mission which seems to be a paradoxon: combining more robustness of the complete system and quality of its subcomponents with less mature technologies. A way out of this dilemma can only be found by reviewing carefully today's qualification and validation processes and understand their strengths, weaknesses and capabilities. This must be the starting point for an evolution to a qualification strategy which is suitable for this fundamentally changed situation. Therefore the limits of today's qualification methods will be discussed as well as some suggestions for future strategies will be made to bring complexity, quality and robustness in an early phase of product lifetime together.

The sensitivity of an SRAM cell functionality metrics when using control voltage level assist techniques is analyzed in read and write operation modes. The efficiency of the assist techniques is estimated by means of parametric analysis. The purpose is to find the degree of functionality metric improvement in each operation mode. The Acceptance Region concept is used for parametric analysis of SRAM cell functionality under random threshold voltage variations. In order to increase the reliability of the SRAM several assist techniques, chosen among the most efficient ones for each operation mode, are considered. This analysis offers a qualitative indication of the cell's functionality improvement by means of the efficient computation of a metric in parameter domain analysis. The results are proven to have high correlation with the ones obtained by means of the classical Monte Carlo simulations with significant savings in comparing different assist techniques.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176700","SRAM Cell;Spec Violation Metric;Voltage Level Assist Techniques","Computer architecture;Measurement;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Reliability;Support vector machines;Voltage control","Monte Carlo methods;SRAM chips;failure analysis;integrated circuit reliability","SRAM cell functionality improvement;SRAM operation reliability;acceptance region concept;classical Monte Carlo simulations;control voltage level assist techniques;functionality metric improvement;parameter domain analysis;parametric analysis;parametric failure mitigation techniques;random process variation;random-threshold voltage variations;read-write operation modes","","1","","10","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the first time, we also present a signal-dependent closed-loop system for the quality assessment of the denoised ECG.

Arrhythmia classification based on a state-of-the-art algorithm with the direct use of noisy data thus obtained shows sensitivity and positive predictivity values of 87.7% and 90.0%, respectively, at an input signal SNR of -9 dB. Detection with the use of ECG data denoised by the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in the performance of the classifier with the corresponding results being 96.5% and 99.1%, respectively. In a related lab trial, we demonstrate a reduction in RMS error of instantaneous heart rate estimates from 47.2% to 7.0% with the use of 56 minutes of denoised ECG from four physically active subjects.

Based on the characteristics of an application or thread the instruction set architecture (ISA) can be adapted to increase performance or reduce resource/power consumption. To benefit from this run-time flexibility automatic selection of an appropriate ISA for each function of a given application is envisioned. This demands a cycle-accurate simulator that is capable of measuring the performance characteristics of an ISA dependent on the target application. However, simulation speed of a cycle-accurate simulator of our reconfigurable VLIW-like processor instances featuring dynamic operation execution would become relatively slow due to the superscalar-like microarchitecture. Within this paper we address this problem by presenting our cycle-approximate simulator approach containing a heuristic dynamic operation execution and memory model that provides a good trade-off between performance and accuracy. Additionally, the simulator features measurement of instruction level parallelism (ILP) that could be theoretically exploited by VLIW processor instances running on our architecture. The theoretical ILP could be used as an indicator for the ISA selection process without the need to simulate any combination of the different ISAs and applications.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176426","","Approximation methods;Computer architecture;Delay;Hardware;Libraries;Registers;VLIW","instruction sets;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;reconfigurable architectures","KAHRISMA architecture;cycle-accurate simulator;cycle-approximate mixed-ISA simulator;dynamic operation execution;instruction format;instruction level parallelism;instruction set;instruction set architecture;memory model;processor architectures;reconfigurable VLIW- like processor;run-time flexibility automatic selection;superscalar-like microarchitecture;thread level parallelism","","4","","14","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the horizon of standards is so wide and heterogeneous that a single FFT implementation hardly satisfies them all. In order to have a reusable, easily extensible and reconfigurable solution, most of the baseband processing is moving towards a software implementation: to this end several new Digital Signal Processor (DSP) architectures are emerging, each with its own set of differentiating properties. Within this context, we propose a software implementation of the FFT on the Block Processing Engine (BPE) platform. Several implementations have been investigated, ranging from a single instruction based approach, to others employing several instructions either in parallel or in pipeline. The outcome is a flexible set of solutions that leaves degrees of freedom in terms of computational load, achievable throughput and power consumption.

It is well known that by allowing software to have explicit fine-grained control over the datapath, the transport-triggered architectures (TTAs) can substantially reduce the RF traffic, thereby minimizing the RF energy. However, it is important to make sure that the gain in RF is not cancelled out by the overhead due to the fine-grained datapath control, in particular, the deterioration of code density in conventional TTAs. In this paper, we analyze the potential of minimizing RF energy in MOVE-Pro, a TTA-based processor framework. We present a flexible compiler backend, which performs energy-aware instruction scheduling to push the limit of RF energy reduction. The experimental results show that with the proposed energy-aware compiler backend, MOVE-Pro is able to significantly reduce RF energy compared to its RISC/VLIW counterparts, by up to 80%. Meanwhile the code density of MOVE-Pro remains at the same level as its RISC/VLIW counterparts, allowing the energy saving in RF to be successfully transferred to total energy saving.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176502","Code Generation;Low Power;MOVE-Pro;Register File;TTA","Energy consumption;Kernel;Radio frequency;Reduced instruction set computing;Registers;Schedules;VLIW","minimisation;parallel architectures;power aware computing;processor scheduling;program compilers","MOVE-Pro;RF energy;RF traffic;RISC-VLIW counterparts;code density deterioration;energy-aware instruction scheduling;explicit datapath architectures;fine-grained datapath control;flexible compiler backend;modern processor architectures;processor power;register file energy minimization scheduling;transport-triggered architectures","","2","","22","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that the leakage power in off-path transistors takes up most of the active leakage power in multiplexers that control routing, and strongly depends on Hamming distance between the state of the on-path input and the states of the off-path inputs. Hence, an off-path leakage power aware routing algorithm is proposed to minimize Hamming distance between the state of on-path input and the states of off-path inputs for each multiplexer.

A new 2-stage Clos switch is proposed to reduce the area overhead of asynchronous SDM routers. It is shown that replacing the crossbars with the 2-stage Clos switches can significantly reduce the area overhead of SDM routers when more than two virtual circuits are used.

However, one issue remains: The power consumption of high-speed wireless transceivers and non-volatile memory grows with the data rate. This prevents from innovations using these high-speed wireless interfaces in ultra-low power (or even energy-passive) medical equipment that can be used by patients without a heavy power source. Clear efforts are required to close this gap, i.e., to provide high-speed wireless solutions with reduced energy consumption per transmitted bit.

The sleep mode is state-retentive, which precludes the necessity to flush the caches after they are woken up. The primary reason for the effectiveness our technique lies in the fact that the latency of detecting cache inactivity, putting a cache to sleep and waking it up before it is accessed, is completely hidden microarchitecturally. The technique incurs insignificant overheads in terms of power and area. Experiments were performed using the GPGPU-Sim simulator on benchmarks that was set up using the CUDA framework. The power and latency modeling of the cache arrays for measuring the wake-up latency and the break-even periods is performed using a 32-nm SOI IBM technology model.

This makes reliability an increasingly critical concern in computer systems. In general, there is a tradeoff between system reliability and performance of multithreaded applications running on multicore architectures. In this paper, we conduct a performance-reliability analysis for different parallel versions of three data-intensive applications including FFT, Jacobi Kernel, and Water Simulation. We measure the performance of these programs by counting execution clock cycles, while the system reliability is measured by Thread Vulnerability Factor (TVF) which is a recently-proposed metric. TVF measures the vulnerability of a thread to hardware faults at a high level. We carry out experiments by executing parallel implementations on multicore architectures and collect data about the performance and vulnerability. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the choice is clear for FFT application and Jacobi Kernel. Transpose algorithm for FFT application results in less than 5% performance loss while the vulnerability increases by 20% compared to binary-exchange algorithm. Unrolled Jacobi code reduces execution time up to 50% with no significant change on vulnerability values. However, the tradeoff is more interesting for Water Simulation where nsquared version reduces the vulnerability values significantly by worsening the performance with similar rates compared to faster but more vulnerable spatial version.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176624","Distributed Algorithms;Multi-Core Architectures and Support;Reliable Parallel","Hardware;Instruction sets;Jacobian matrices;Measurement;Multicore processing;Registers;Reliability","Jacobian matrices;fast Fourier transforms;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips","FFT application;Jacobi Kernel;TVF;chip multiprocessors;computer systems;execution clock cycles;multicore architectures;multithreaded applications;performance-reliability tradeoff analysis;thread vulnerability factor;transient errors;unrolled Jacobi code;water simulation","","1","","21","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Time analysable synchronisation techniques for parallelised hard real-time applications","Gerdes, M.; Kluge, F.; Ungerer, T.; Rochange, C.; Sainrat, P.","Univ. of Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2012","20120403","2012","","","671","676","In this paper we present synchronisation techniques for hard real-time (HRT) capable execution of parallelised applications on embedded multi-core processors. We show how commonly used software synchronisation techniques can be implemented in a time analysable way based on the proposed hardware primitives. We choose to implement the hardware synchronisation primitives in the memory controller for two reasons. Firstly, we remove pessimism in the WCET analysis of parallelised HRT applications. Secondly, we enable that the implementation of synchronisation techniques is mostly independent of the chosen instruction set architecture (ISA) which allows to use the existing ISAs without enhancements. We analyse the presented synchronisation techniques with the static worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis tool OTAWA. In summary, our specifically engineered synchronisation techniques yield a tremendous gain on the WCET of parallelised HRT applications.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176555","","Hardware;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Real time systems;Synchronization","embedded systems;instruction sets;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;synchronisation","ISA;OTAWA tool;WCET analysis;embedded multicore processors;hardware synchronisation primitives;instruction set architecture;memory controller;parallelised hard real-time applications;software synchronisation techniques;static worst-case execution time analysis tool;time analysable synchronisation techniques","","8","","17","","","12-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following this paradigm, the STMicroelectronics/CEA Platform 2012 (P2012) project designed an area- and power-efficient many-core accelerator as an answer to the needs of computing power of next-generation data-intensive embedded applications. Synchronization handling on this architecture was critical since speed-ups of parallel implementations of embedded applications strongly depend on the ability to exploit the largest possible number of cores while limiting task management overhead. This paper presents the HardWare Synchronizer (HWS), a flexible hardware accelerator for synchronization operations in the P2012 architecture. Experiments on a multi-core test chip showed that the HWS has less than 1% area overhead while reducing synchronization latencies (up to 2.8 times) and contentions.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513565","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Hardware;Power demand;Registers;Software;Synchronization","","","","2","","11","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fast and efficient Lagrangian Relaxation-based Discrete Gate Sizing","Livramento, Vinicius S.; Guth, Chrystian; Guntzel, Jose Luis; Johann, Marcelo O.","Computer Sciences Department - PPGCC, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013","20130504","2013","","","1855","1860","Discrete gate sizing has attracted a lot of attention recently as the EDA industry faces the challenge of optimizing large standard cell-based circuits. The discreteness of the problem, along with complex timing models, stringent constraints and ever increasing circuit sizes make the problem very difficult to tackle. Lagrangian Relaxation is an effective technique to handle complex constrained optimization problems and therefore has been used for gate sizing. In this paper, we propose an improved Lagrangian Relaxation formulation for leakage power minimization that accounts for maximum gate input slew and maximum gate output capacitance in addition to the circuit timing constraints. We also present a fast topological greedy heuristic to solve the Lagrangian Relaxation Subproblem and a complementary procedure to fix the few remaining slew and capacitace violations. The experimental results, generated by using the ISPD 2012 Discrete Gate Sizing Contest infrastructure, show that our technique is able to optimize a circuit with up to 959K gates within only 51 minutes. Comparing to the ISPD Contest top three teams, our technique obtained on average 18.9%, 16.7% and 43.8% less leakage power, while being 38, 31 and 39 times faster.","1530-1591","978-1-4673-5071-6","","10.7873/DATE.2013.370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513816","","Lead;Linear programming;Logic gates","","","","2","","19","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
