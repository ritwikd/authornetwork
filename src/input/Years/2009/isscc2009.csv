Operating in discrete time also allows for system reconfiguration by changing the sampling frequency. Moreover, different sampling frequencies can be applied throughout a system. This multirate feature can then be exploited to trade performance for power and flexibility. The multirate technique can also be of benefit to discrete-time DeltaSigma modulators. In DeltaSigma modulators, the first integrators are the largest contributors to the overall power consumption since they set the overall noise and distortion of the modulator. The multirate technique can then be used to reduce the sampling speed of the first integrators and hence the power and compensate for loss in resolution by increasing the speed of the last integrators. However, multirate processing inside a single-loop DeltaSigma modulator introduces additional complexity due to the feedback from the last integrators to the input operating at a lower sampling frequency. This complexity can be avoided by using a cascaded architecture in which the sampling frequency is modified between the stages. It can be shown that a cascade DeltaSigma with the first loop operating at fs/2 and the second loop at 2fs is equivalent in terms of resolution to a cascade DeltaSigma with both loops operating at fs. Furthermore, a cascaded implementation can offer a power-efficient implementation in a multimode context by switching off the appropriate last stages . In this paper we present a 90 nm CMOStri-mode DT multirate cascade DeltaSigma modulator.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977365","","3G mobile communication;Bluetooth;CMOS technology;Delta modulation;Energy consumption;Feedback;Frequency;GSM;Robustness;Sampling methods","3G mobile communication;Bluetooth;CMOS digital integrated circuits;delta-sigma modulation;discrete time systems","Bluetooth;GSM;UMTS;digital CMOS;discrete-time system;multirate cascade DeltaSigma modulator;power 3.4 mW to 6.8 mW;power consumption;sampling frequency;size 90 nm;transistor","","3","","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A variable delay line (VCDL) or a DLL is widely used for elastic timing control not only in source-synchronous serial links but also in clock-and-data- recovery systems for further enhancing the BER performance. The conventional analog delay line, however, suffers from PVT variations, and calibrating the analog delay line brings substantial design efforts. For better testability and robust operation, a digitally controlled delay line is preferred. The semi- digital DLL or the all-digital DLL provides more robust delay control, but achieving fine timing resolution such as sub-ps is still challenging due to an algorithmic jitter problem.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977476","","Circuit noise;Clocks;Delay;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency conversion;Interpolation;Jitter;Linearity;Phase modulation;Quantization","UHF circuits;clock and data recovery circuits;delay lines;delta-sigma modulation;error statistics;robust control","BER performance;analog delay line calibration;clock skew;clock-and-data-recovery system;elastic timing control;frequency 0.4 GHz to 1.6 GHz;low-OSR DeltaSigma DLL;oversampling ratio;robust delay control;self-referenced multiphase generation;source-synchronous serial link;variable delay line;wireline application","","1","","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design consists of a mixer and a phase-generation oscillator for each channel, in addition to a four-channel intermediate-frequency (IF) summer and 256b serial register for digital programming. This unique architecture exploits the steady-state phase at the output of an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) to create the desired phase-shift pattern. The four-channel receiver core draws only 42 mW (10.5 mW/channel) from a 1.55 V power supply and occupies 1.2times1.2 mm<sup>2</sup> of active area. This is approximately 50% lower power than phased-array receivers reported in the recent literature.

The trade-off between flexibility, performance and power consumption is a key focus of video-codec design. Homogeneous multi-core processors are power-consuming and achieving high-throughput is difficult. While dedicated circuits can minimize power consumption, the dedicated decoders and encoders in previous reports have difficulty performing all of the media processing that is indispensable for a modern cellular phone.

Single-channel AFEs have been published; however, there are drawbacks to using multiple discrete single-channel AFEs in a multichannel system. For example, column readout patterns are particularly sensitive to mismatch between AFE channels. Also, DSLR cameras support many different frame capture modes and read-out patterns, requiring clock rates from below 10MS/s to over 70MS/s, and previous AFEs have not been designed to operate over such a wide range.

The time interval between the ramp starting point, which is synchronous with the reference clock, and the instant the input signal crosses the ramp is measured by a 2-step time-to-digital converter.

Power consumption is an important issue of digital reception when digitization of the RF signals into N bits needs frequencies up to 20 GHz. We hereafter describe a non-coherent receiver that simply digitizes the signal asynchronously on only one bit and calculates the signal power in a 500 MHz bandwidth. The sampling frequency is hence reduced to 1 GHz while the 1b conversion simplifies the design and consequently reduces the power consumption. The proposed transmitter also has mostly-digital architecture. It achieves low power consumption by generating pulses without use of high frequency synthesis and by activating the generator only during pulse emission. Low power consumption and integration level are further improved by using an integrated digital baseband that can be optionally activated.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977433","","Bandwidth;Baseband;Energy consumption;Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;Power generation;Pulse generation;Sampling methods;Transceivers;Transmitters","CMOS integrated circuits;low-power electronics;transceivers;ultra wideband communication","802.15.4a-compliant fully integrated UWB transceiver;CMOS;digital reception;frequency 4 GHz to 5 GHz;frequency synthesis;integrated digital baseband;low power consumption;size 0.13 mum","","9","1","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within pulsed radios, noncoherent (NC) RF front ends that use simple square-and-integrate samplers offer significant energy-per-bit savings over their coherent counterparts. However, such samplers lose phase information and accumulate squared noise over the integration period. While this increases the SNR required to relay a bit reliably, the greater challenge is achieving signal synchronization. Telemetry applications often have small pay- loads (10 to 100 bits) where synchronization time dominates. Furthermore, synchronization performance is being continually pushed to enable positioning capability. Hence, the ultimate advantage of NC receivers relies on their ability to synchronize efficiently.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977403","","Baseband;Clocks;Costs;Estimation error;Frequency synchronization;Matched filters;Physical layer;Radio frequency;Receivers;Transceivers","ultra wideband communication","IR-UWB radios;bit rate 16 Mbit/s;low data rate sensing applications;noncoherent IR-UWB digital baseband;power 1.6 mW;pulsed radios;time -1 ns;time 1 ns;voltage 0.55 V","","5","","7","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A 0.1-to-5GHz SDR receiver, including LO generation, has been developed in a 45nm CMOS technology. To be competitive with dedicated single-mode radios, this SDR combines the most demanding requirements such as high sensitivities for cellular standards, low phase noise, and high linearity for the inter-modulation test in DVB-H mode.

For digital circuits, the leakage current results in a high stand-by power consumption. For analog circuits, it degrades the accuracy and performance. PLLs are widely used in various wireline and wireless communication systems. For a phase/frequency detector (PFD) and a divider in a PLL, the leakage current increases the in-band phase noise and jitter. For a VCO, the leakage current alters the common-mode voltage, and as a result the VCO may not operate at a low frequency. For a charge pump (CP) and a loop filter, the leakage current induces a steady phase error and jitter. It is because the leakage current charges or discharges the loop filter while the CP is off. Since a PLL usually needs a large capacitor in its loop filter, the MOS capacitor is often used to save the area. However, the large MOS capacitor suffers from the large leakage current in a nanoscale CMOS process.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977477","","CMOS process;Digital circuits;Filters;Jitter;Leakage current;MOS capacitors;Mixed analog digital integrated circuits;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;CMOS digital integrated circuits;MOS capacitors;charge pump circuits;jitter;leakage currents;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;nanoelectronics;phase detectors;phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","MOS capacitor;PLL;VCO;charge pump;digital circuit;frequency detector;high-performance analog integrated circuit;jitter;leakage current;leakage-suppression technique;loop filter;mixed-signal integrated circuit;nanoscale CMOS process;phase detector;phase-locked loop;size 65 nm;voltage-controlled oscillator;wireless communication system","","6","1","7","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC 2009. IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","402","403,403a","Recently, there has been an increasing demand for SoCs in the biomedical field. In implantable applications, SoCs are designed under very stringent power and area constraints. The analog and mixed-signal circuits as well as digital circuits in those SoCs require a clock source, because clock-based signal-processing techniques, such as sampling and chopper stabilization, are often used. The primary clock source for such SoCs needs to provide good accuracy and long-term stability of the oscillation frequency foscto minimize variations and drifts of the system characteristics. A fairly pure clock signal is required to avoid signal distortion when sampling or chopping techniques are applied. Considering such a source is typically a free-running oscillator, and biomedical signals of typical interest reside at low frequencies, the close-in phase noise is important. For implantable biomedical sensor SoCs, due to high power consumption of quartz crystal oscillators and their bulky size, monolithic oscillators are preferred as a primary clock source. Relaxation oscillators can operate with low power and set their oscillation period Tosc in well-defined manner while consuming small silicon area. However, their performance is limited by process variations, noisy current sources, and noise and offset voltages of the comparators. Geraedts et al. presented an idea of subtracting a fixed charge packet and filtering out the comparator noise to improve the phase noise particularly at large offset frequencies. In this work, a self-clocked offset-cancellation scheme is presented for comparators in the relaxation oscillator, resulting in smaller frequency drifts and lower close-in phase fluctuations, which are more relevant parameters for primary clock sources in implantable biomedical SoCs.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977478","","Biosensors;Choppers;Circuit stability;Clocks;Digital circuits;Distortion;Frequency;Oscillators;Phase noise;Sampling methods","biomedical electronics;biosensors;crystal oscillators;phase noise;relaxation oscillators;system-on-chip","biomedical signals;clock-based signal-processing techniques;close-in phase noise;implantable biomedical sensor SoC;precision relaxation oscillator;quartz crystal oscillators;self-clocked offset-cancellation scheme","","15","2","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Implementation of high-performance analog circuits in nanometric technologies faces several challenges. Time-domain digital signal processing (TDSP) can be used as an alternative for some analog circuits to overcome these challenges. The TDSP technique utilizes the high timing resolution available in nanoscale technologies, and can be implemented using digital circuits that are inherently less susceptible to noise. Circuits using this technique also become faster, smaller and consume less power with technology scaling. Hence, solutions using TDSP with as many digital circuits as possible are desired. An ADC architecture that uses a VCO-based time-domain quantizer is presented. This architecture uses a conventional feedback element (multi-element DAC with DEM) and 950 MHz sample rate that leads to high power consumption. In this work, a pulse-width modulator (PWM) and an all- digital time-to-digital converter (TDC) are used to implement the quantizer as well as the feedback element in the time domain. This approach achieves the necessary linearity in the feedback path without DEM or calibration, and allows a low output rate of 250 MS/S.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977364","","Analog circuits;CMOS technology;Communication industry;Digital circuits;Feedback;Integrated circuit technology;Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation converters;Time domain analysis;Wireless communication","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;voltage-controlled oscillators","DeltaSigma ADC;VCO-based time-domain quantizer;bandwidth 20 MHz;digital time-to-digital converter;feedback element;high-performance analog circuits;multibit time-domain quantizer;nanoscale CMOS technologies;pulse-width modulator;time-domain digital signal processing;wireless communication industry","","11","3","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to satisfy strict specifications, a column-parallel ADC is a key element in a state-of-the-art CIS. However, this architecture leads to side-effects such as vertical fixed pattern noise (VFPN) and read noise. In order to reduce these non-idealities, several techniques can be applied such as digital CDS using a single-slope ADC, and pre-amplified digital CDS using a SAR ADC. It is challenging to overcome the difficulty of compatibility between ADC speed and bit resolution, while maintaining low-noise performance and high dynamic range (DR). In this paper, a low-noise high-DR and high-speed CIS with a 13b column-parallel cyclic ADC based on a single-ended architecture is presented. The cyclic ADC requires 12 cycles for 13b resolution. The ADC requires identical conversions for reset and signals, within the limited horizontal time period, at a frame rate of over 300 fps, so as to achieve perfect digital CDS and ultra-low VFPN. In addition, lower total read noise is achieved without signal amplification by removing: (1) dual analog paths in fully differential circuits, (2) a common reference route, and (3) digital coupling noise. Published cyclic ADCs that are located in the column of a CIS have column pitch of 15 mum or larger. The circuits with the single-ended architecture presented in this paper are squeezed into 5.6 mum column pitch and can be applied to 2.8 mum-pitch pixels with double-side disposition.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977411","","CMOS image sensors;Capacitors;Circuits;Computational Intelligence Society;Dynamic range;Image converters;Image sampling;Linearity;Signal resolution;Switches","CMOS image sensors;analogue-digital conversion;image resolution;integrated circuit noise","CMOS image sensor;SAR ADC;column-parallel single-ended cyclic ADC;common reference route;differential circuit;digital coupling noise;dual analog path;noise figure 71 dB;pixel resolution;signal amplification;size 2.8 mum;size 5.6 mum;vertical fixed pattern noise","","4","2","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, however, the transfer curve of the PD may not be linear or even monotonic for large Deltathetas . With a nonlinear PD, the transient response of PLL cannot be easily formulated and slow down the acquisition behavior.This work presents an edge-missing compensator (EMC) that has arbitrary width of linear operation region. The EMC also can precisely compensate the missing edges to speed up the acquisition of PLL with low power and smaller area. Precisely counting the number of missing edges is not an easy task. One may count the number of edges in both input signals. However when Deltathetas exceeds the range of plusmn2pi, miscounting occurs when the both input signals raise at the same time. On the other hand, some literatures interfacing with PFD to achieve fast locking feature, but the loop parameters are sensitive and may not be appropriately applied for diverse PLL applications.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977474","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Clocks;Electromagnetic compatibility;Frequency synthesizers;Noise measurement;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement;Phase noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","phase detectors;phase locked loops","PLLs;edge-missing compensator;fast-settling wide-locking range;phase detector;phase locked loop","","3","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the emergence of consumer applications for sensors and reconfigurable radio, the MEMS industry is at a growth inflection point. Many start-ups are trying to bring low-cost devices to market using a fab-less or a fab-light business model. The pure-play MEMS foundries have grown in number and capability, and cost-effective hermetic encapsulation techniques are now widely available. Despite this, successful commercialization stories are sparse among MEMS start-ups and are mostly generated by the larger and more established companies that have introduced MEMS products after many years of costly internal research and development for high price margin applications. In addition, products have mostly represented single functionality so far while sensor fusion and integration ideas for multi-functionality and reconfigurable chips may become increasingly popular. Here are some questions the MEMS industry is faced with: Are today's MEMS low cost enough to compete and survive in consumer markets? Given the smaller mask count and larger feature sizes of micromechanical devices, can MEMS die-cost-per-area become less than CMOS die-cost-per-area? What challenges are involved in making this a reality? What integration schemes will have a more promising future? Can planar integration of CMOS and MEMS survive the cost and size scaling? Can we think of a generic process flow that can address 80–90% of the MEMS market?","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977538","","","","","","0","","","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Leveraging the VCO output phase directly precludes the need to span the entire nonlinear K<sub>v</sub> characteristic since small perturbations (in the range of 10s of mV) at the tuning node are sufficient to shift the VCO phase by a substantial amount. Since an open-loop VCO is sensitive to frequency offsets and drift, and easily saturates its phase detector for large input signals, some form of negative feedback is necessary. Here, a multibit DAC subtracts the previously quantized phase value from the VCO input, creating a residue that is integrated during the next clock cycle. This feedback loop not only allows large signals to drive the VCO without incurring distortion from K<sub>v</sub> nonlinearity, but also it is a 1s,-order CT DeltaSigma ADC loop, and it therefore 1s,-order shapes quantization noise.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977362","","Clocks;Drives;Feedback loop;Negative feedback;Negative feedback loops;Nonlinear distortion;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;voltage-controlled oscillators","BW CT DeltaSigma ADC;CMOS;VCO-based integrator;VCO-based quantizer;feedback loop;frequency 20 MHz;multibit DAC;negative feedback;power 87 mW;size 0.13 mum;voltage-controlled oscillator","","6","4","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A fractional-N PLL with an analog discrete-time PFD and loop filter, along with an error canceling DAC is utilized to alleviate the impact of DeltaSigma quantization error and nonlinearities on the phase noise and spurious emissions. A two-state type-I loop replaces the more conventional type-ll charge-pump PLLs. The type-I loop shifts the operating point of the phase detector away from the nonlinear region (i.e., close to zero phase error), thus eliminating the need for special CP linearization techniques. In PLL architecture, a third-order re-quantization path along with an 8b current-steering DAC reduces quantization noise induced phase error by more than 20 dB, enabling a wide loop bandwidth of 1 MHz. The two-state PFD drives a PMOS current source, integrating phase error across the sampling capacitor. PLL can enable data-weighted averaging in order to achieve DEM (dynamic-element matching) between the PFD path and the noise-cancellation path. The synthesizer is fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 mum CMOS process and draws 26 mA from a 1.8V supply.

IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","100","101,101a","Short-distance parallel optical links are poised to replace copper interconnects in high throughput links between computing nodes. In the receiver front-end of such systems, one- and two-dimensional monolithically integrated arrays of power- and area-efficient TIAs are required. Differential signaling is preferred for superior supply rejection while power consumption per amplifier unit should be minimized to avoid heat dissipation issues and to maintain the energy efficiency (J/bit) advantage over copper interconnect. On the other hand, lower gain is acceptable due to the intended short-haul application. Multi-Gb/s CMOS TIAs suffer from a fundamental BW limit at the input. The TIA input sees significant extrinsic capacitive loading (C<sub>IN</sub>), not only from the photodiode (C<sub>PD</sub>) which is dominant, but also from the ESD structures (C<sub>ESD</sub>) and the offset-cancellation circuit (C<sub>OC</sub>), which is needed due to finite extinction ratio of the transmitter laser diodes. The impact is more severe in CMOS as the input impedance of the circuit (1/g<sub>m</sub>) is relatively high due to the low g<sub>m</sub>/l<sub>D</sub> of CMOS technology. The regulated cascode approach is an effective BW-extension technique that desensitizes the circuit to input capacitance by reducing the TIA input impedance through negative feedback. However, in its conventional implementation, power dissipation is increased due to the additional broadband feedback amplifier while stability can be compromised by phase shifts. In this work, the voltage gain available from the common-gate TIA front-end is reused for the compensation rather than employing a dedicated amplifier; with the aim of demonstrating a more power- and area-efficient approach to CMOS BW extension.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977327","","CMOS technology;Copper;Electrostatic discharge;Impedance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Optical fiber communication;Optical interconnections;Power amplifiers;Power system interconnection;Throughput","CMOS integrated circuits;amplifiers;integrated optoelectronics;optical interconnections","BW extension;CMOS TIA;ESD structures;amplifier unit;bit rate 5 Gbit/s;differential signaling;energy efficiency;extrinsic capacitive loading;finite extinction ratio;gain-reuse regulated cascode compensation;heat dissipation;offset-cancellation circuit;parallel optical interconnects;phase shift;photodiode;power 14 mW;power consumption;power dissipation;receiver front-end;short-distance parallel optical link;transimpedance amplifier;transmitter laser diodes;voltage gain","","9","","2","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these sensors do not take part in the main computing activity but rather play the auxiliary, albeit important, role of temperature monitoring, their presence in terms of area, power, and design effort should be minimal, thus, all-digital sensors are desired. Temperature sensing based on temperature-dependent delays of inverters could be suited for microprocessor applications, as it lends itself to digital implementation: by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC), an inverter delay can be compared to an absolute delay reference and converted to a digital temperature output. We report on an all-digital CMOS temperature sensor for microprocessor application, which also exploits temperature-dependent inverter delays within the TDC-based framework. It, however, has two improvements over prior art. First, it removes the effect of process variation on inverter delays via calibration at one temperature point (instead of 2-point calibration), thus, reducing high volume production cost. Second, we use two fine-precision DLLs, one to synthesize a set of temperature-independent delay references in a closed loop, the other as a TDC to compare temperature-dependent inverter delays to the references. The use of DLLs simplifies sensor operation and yields a high measurement bandwidth (5 kS/s) at 7b resolution, which could enable fast temperature tracking.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977311","","Art;Calibration;Delay;Energy management;Inverters;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Thermal management","CMOS digital integrated circuits;delay lock loops;microprocessor chips;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","CMOS all-digital temperature sensor;complementary metal-oxide semiconductor;delay-locked loop;digital implementation;dual-DLL;microprocessor thermal monitoring;temperature-dependent inverter delay;time-to-digital converter","","30","1","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As each controller regulates the output in time-multiplexed manner, it is difficult to extend the number of outputs and power capacity. The converter reported in solves these limitations by adopting comparator-controlled method. Each comparator-controlled output receives its required energy and one final PWM controller adjusts the total inductor current so that the remaining current is adequate for the last output. However, as the PWM controller regulates one of the converter outputs, the response of controller becomes slow and voltage ripple of the other outputs increases when the load current of PWM-controlled output is reduced to zero (or near zero). As a possible solution, minimum bleeding current can be set for the last output, however, this approach degrades the efficiency at light-load condition. Also, the operation region of the previously reported multiple- output converters is restricted to step-up mode only.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977498","","Capacitors;Current control;DC-DC power converters;Error correction;Inductors;Pulse width modulation;Switches;Switching circuits;Switching converters;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;electric current control;switching convertors","discontinuous conduction mode;multiple-output step-down switching DC-DC converter;multiple-output step-up switching DC-DC converter;pseudo-continuous conduction mode;single-inductor dual-output boost converter;vestigial current control","","13","1","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The LDO usually comes after a switching DC-DC converter to reduce the output ripples and provide a regulated voltage source for noise-sensitive blocks. For a higher level of integration, there is a need to increase the operating frequency of the switching converters. This necessitates a subsequent LDO regulator with high ripple rejection at frequencies up to several MHz. These LDO regulators should also provide a low drop-out voltage to cope with the low supply voltage of the state-of-the-art CMOS technology.This paper presents a high PSR low-voltage LDO regulator using a feedforward ripple cancellation (FFRC) technique. The LDO maintains conventional loop dynamics, supplies high current, has a low quiescent current, and provides a PSR better than -56dB over a wide frequency range.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977442","","CMOS technology;Communication switching;DC-DC power converters;Energy management;Frequency;Low voltage;Noise reduction;Power system management;Regulators;Switching converters","CMOS integrated circuits;feedforward;low-power electronics;voltage regulators","CMOS LDO regulator;current 25 mA;drop-out voltage;feedforward ripple-cancellation technique;frequency 10 MHz;low drop-out linear regulators;power-supply rejection;size 0.13 mum;supply voltage","","5","1","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many players that will be competing for the lion's share of this market. The usage scenarios of the MID necessitate an effective combination of very high performance with low power consumption. This means that existing high performance, personal computer focused, CPU architectures will need to battle power consumption, and existing consumer focused, low power, embedded core architectures will need to address performance, in order to penetrate this market segment. Last, but not the least, there remains the question of whether backward software compatibility will be the determining factor of which architecture approach will ultimately dominate the MID market.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977545","","","","","","0","","","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the V<sub>T</sub>-shift issue in thin-film transistors (TFT) has to be addressed to enable wide deployment. Voltage programming and current programming are well-known V<sub>T</sub>-shift-compensation techniques for analog driving. However, they all need more than 4 TFTs per pixel, which increases the panel complexity and decreases yield and aperture ratio. Recently, a V<sub>T</sub>-shift compensation technique that uses a 2TFT-1C pixel in an analog driving AMOLED has been reported. However, it requires OLED supply voltage programming, and shows a 14% variation in OLED current after V<sub>T</sub>-shift compensation, which is not enough for high-definition applications. Digital driving has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the V<sub>T</sub>-shift issue with a simple pixel structure and to provide flexibility to the driver design. In this paper shows the pixel structures for voltage programming, current programming and digital driving. While the gate of the driving TFT (M2) is in the high state, the voltage across M2 is very small due to the large current-driving capability of a TFT as compared with an OLED. Hence, the current through the OLED is dominated by the supply voltage (PVDD), and minimally affected by the variations in TFT characteristics. Digital driving is also useful for true dark-level expression since the OLED can be completely turned off for black gray levels.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977412","","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Digital modulation;Driver circuits;Energy consumption;Flat panel displays;Humans;Noise shaping;Pulse width modulation;Thin film transistors;Visual system","delta-sigma modulation;organic light emitting diodes;thin film transistors","DeltaSigma modulation;QVGA AMOLED display;V<sub>T</sub>-shift-compensation technique;active-matrix organic LED;current programming;digital driving technique;high-definition display application;next-generation display;pixel structure;thin-film transistor;voltage programming","","1","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Switching mixers also require a large LO power in the range of OdBm for ideal switching operation. In this work, a 0.6V mixer for Bluetooth specification with a target sensitivity of -90dBm, which requires a NF of 12dB and IIP3 of -7dBm, is described.

SFDR is limited by the linearity (intercept point IIP3 mostly, sometimes IIP2) and the noise floor. As receivers already have low noise figure (NF) there is more room for improving the SFDR by increasing the linearity. As there is a strong relation between distortion and voltage swing, it is challenging to maintain or even improve linearity intercept points in future CMOS processes with lower supply voltages. Circuits can be linearized with feedback but loop gain at RF is limited. Moreover, after LNA gain, mixer linearity becomes even tougher. If the amplification is postponed to IF, much more loop gain is available to linearize the amplifier. This paper proposes such an LNA-less mixer-first receiver. By careful analysis and optimization of a passive mixer core for low conversion loss and low noise folding it is shown that it is possible to realize IIP3>11 dBm and NF<6.5dB, i.e. a remarkably high SFDR>79dB in 1MHz bandwidth over a decade of RF frequencies.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977388","","CMOS process;Dynamic range;Feedback circuits;Linearity;Noise figure;Noise measurement;Radio frequency;Receivers;Spectral analysis;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MMIC mixers;integrated circuit noise;microwave receivers","CMOS receiver;LNA-less mixer-first receiver;RF frequencies;bandwidth 1 MHz;conversion loss;distortion;frequency 0.2 GHz to 2.0 GHz;noise;noise folding;passive mixer;size 65 nm;spurious-free dynamic range","","13","7","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As shown in Fig. 6.5.2, first the IF l/Q voltage inputs are filtered by the passive LPF to lower the far-out noise. By switching on/off the transistors M1 to M4 through the quadrature-phased LO with 25% duty cycle, the filtered IF quadrature input voltages V<sub>l+</sub>, V<sub>Q+</sub>, V<sub>l-</sub>, and V<sub>Q-</sub>. are sequentially copied to the voltage mixer output, which sees the high input impedance of the PA driver. Such operation leads to a direct quadrature voltage modulation. The output of the voltage mixer contains both the desired fundamental LO mixing product, and the unwanted odd-harmonic LO mixing products. For a packaged device the unwanted harmonics can be attenuated below -40dBc by a harmonic filter (formed by the RF output bonding wire and capacitors) after the PA driver.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977337","","Bonding;Harmonic filters;Impedance;Multiaccess communication;Packaging;Passive filters;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Transmitters;Voltage","code division multiple access;modulators;power amplifiers;surface acoustic waves","LO mixing product;PA driver;direct quadrature voltage modulation;harmonic filter;low-power SAW-less WCDMA transmit modulator;passive voltage mixer;size 45 nm","","8","1","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially stringent requirements are imposed on the DACs for AMLCD data drivers: uniform performance in each data channel, and compactness in chip implementation, as well as extremely low power consumption. The prevalent use of resistor-DAC (RDAC) architectures is partly owing to their uniform characteristics, because each RDAC in the data channels shares a common resistor string for reference voltage. In this paper, a piecewise-linear 10 b DAC architecture is introduced. An interpolation scheme with drain-current modulation shows uniform channel performance, and keeps the 10 b data driver size smaller than that of a conventional 8 b driver. The DAC architecture requires no modification to the conventional data-driver structure except for the addition of a minimal number of circuits for drain-current modulation. The chip is fabricated in a 0.1 mum CMOS process.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977409","","Active matrix liquid crystal displays;CMOS process;Driver circuits;Error correction;Linearity;Measurement standards;Piecewise linear techniques;Resistors;Solid state circuits;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;digital-analogue conversion;driver circuits;liquid crystal displays;low-power electronics;piecewise linear techniques","AMLCD driver IC;CMOS process;active-matrix LCD;data channel;data voltage generation;drain-current modulation;interpolation scheme;low power consumption;piecewise-linear DAC architecture;word length 10 bit","","4","","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, pre-emphasis techniques have demonstrated significantly better energy-efficiency than repeater interconnects. To further improve energy-efficiency over pre-emphasis techniques that require analog subtraction, our TX selects a pattern-dependent current to inject into the wire, performing feed-forward equalization (FFE) while mitigating the nonlinearity of the driver. This 3-tap charge-injecting (CI) FFE enables stronger equalization than the capacitively driven TX or edge-detection pre-emphasis, achieving data-rate of 4 Gb/s over a 1 cm on-chip wire. The TIA at RX improves bandwidth, signal amplitude, and reduces bias power, breaking the trade-offs in conventional resistor termination, and mitigates equalized signal degradation due to impedance changes in dynamic current sensing.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977310","","Bandwidth;Degradation;Energy efficiency;Feedforward systems;Filters;Repeaters;Resistors;Sampling methods;Transceivers;Wire","CMOS integrated circuits;charge injection;equalisers;integrated circuit interconnections;nonlinear filters;preamplifiers;transceivers","equalized on-chip interconnect;feed-forward equalization;nonlinear charge-injecting 3-tap transmit filter;sampling receiver;size 10 mm;size 90 nm;transceiver;transimpedance pre-amplifier;transimpedance receiver","","9","","8","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The limitation of the classical folding architecture is the separate coarse channel to determine which fold an input signal is in. Higher-resolution ADCs benefit from a higher order of folding, which results in more closely spaced folds and makes the alignment between this ""fine"" channel and the ""coarse"" channel increasingly difficult due to offset and settling mismatch. In this paper we eliminate this separate coarse channel using instead a single ""unified"" set of cascaded folding stages, in which each folding stage acts as the coarse channel for the following folding stage. This extends previous work where the coarse channel is distributed and where the cascaded folding stages are pipelined. Our approach is demonstrated in a dual 1.8 V 1.0 GS/s 10 b ADC that achieves plusmn0.2 LSB DNL and 9.1 ENOB at Nyquist while consuming 1.2 W/channel.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977316","","Calibration;Clocks;Degradation;Equations;Error correction;Frequency conversion;Frequency estimation;Jitter;Linearity;Solid state circuits","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;calibration;cascade networks;interpolation","CMOS design;ENOB;Nyquist frequency;cascaded folding stages;coarse channel;self-calibrating unified-folding-interpolating ADC;voltage 1.8 V;word length 10 bit","","8","","7","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless interface allows the removal of a highly capacitive ESD protection device and results in a 2times reduction in power consumption, and a 40times reduction in I/O circuit-layout area. Using bonding wires for the power supply and wireless interface for data access reduces the number of bonding wires in the 64-chip stack from over 1,500 wires to less than 200 wires. This reduction in the number of bonding wires makes it possible to integrate 64 chips in one package, which conventionally requires eight separate packages. This wireless interface is based on inductive coupling between inductors on the stacked chips. The inductors emit magnetic field both upwards and downwards. This creates both intentional and unintentional communication link, which makes it difficult to be used in homogeneous stacking. Our technique enables data delivery upwards and downwards for memory read and write with measured BER < 10<sup>-12</sup>.

CFIAs are attractive because of their ability to sense differential input voltages in a common-mode voltage range (CMVR) that includes either of the supply rails. They can thus interface directly, for instance, with ground-referenced sensors in a single-supply system. This property results from the fact that the input voltage is sensed by an open-loop input stage, which typically exploits the inherent level-shift provided by the input transistors' threshold voltage to sense beyond the rail.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977439","","Bandwidth;Circuit noise;Clocks;Gain measurement;Instruments;Operational amplifiers;Rails;Resistors;Transconductors;Voltage","instrumentation amplifiers","chopping;common-mode voltage range;current-feedback instrumentation amplifier;open-loop input stage;ping-pong auto-zeroing","","11","1","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Harvesting ambient vibration energy through piezoelectric (PE) means is a popular energy harvesting technique that can potentially supply 10 to 100's of muW of available power. One of the limitations of existing PE harvesters is in their interface circuitry. Commonly used full-bridge rectifiers and voltage doublers severely limit the electrical power extractable from a PE harvesting element. Further, the power consumed in the control circuits of these harvesters reduces the amount of usable electrical power. In this paper, a bias-flip rectifier that can improve upon the power extraction capability of existing full-bridge rectifiers by up to 4.2times is presented. An efficient control circuit with embedded DC-DC converters that can share their filter inductor with the bias-flip rectifier thereby reducing the volume and component count of the overall solution is demonstrated. The circuit diagram and figures are also given.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977425","","Buck converters;DC-DC power converters;Delay;Inductors;Rectifiers;Regulators;Switches;Switching circuits;Voltage;Zero current switching","energy harvesting;inductors;piezoelectric devices;power supply circuits;rectifying circuits","ambient vibration energy harvesting;bias-flip rectifier;control circuit;electrical power;filter inductor;full-bridge rectifier;piezoelectric energy-harvesting interface circuit;power 10 muW to 100 muW;shared inductor;voltage doubler","","10","","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the continued transistor performance enhancement and extensive process-circuit co-optimization, the 32 nm SRAM design is able to achieve 2times improvement in density and 15% faster access speed when compared to the 45 nm design at the same voltage. The design supports a broad range of operating voltages to enable dynamic voltage scaling in today's high-performance and low-power applications.

However, linear PDs face a speed limitation at around 10 Gb/s, primarily because of the required pulsewidth comparison and finite flip-flop CK-to-Q delay. Parallelism could relax the stringent speed requirement, but it also introduces other issues such as clock skews and jitters. Frequency acquisition without an external reference such as Pottbacker FD and other similar approaches require quadrature clocks, potentially leading to higher phase noise as well. This paper presents the design and analysis of a 20 Gb/s full-rate CDR circuit in 90 nm CMOS, which completely eliminates the conventional issues by using an alternative linear PD structure and a referenceless FD with automaticity.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977460","","Automatic frequency control;Bandwidth;Clocks;Detectors;Flip-flops;Jitter;Phase detection;Phase noise;Solid state circuits;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;clock and data recovery circuits;clocks;phase noise","CMOS;automatic frequency acquisition;bit rate 20 Gbit/s;finite flip-flop CK-to-Q delay;full-rate linear CDR circuit;phase noise;quadrature clock;size 90 nm","","1","","8","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the cost reduction for screening test will be a key issue to maintain continuous LSI-performance scaling. This paper proposes a novel wireless DC voltage transmission technique which implements all the circuits for DC tests into the area of an inductor. There are two keys to this technique.

Recently, design techniques to enhance the locking range of ILFDs have been reported. Injection into two coupled LC oscillators and sandwiched injection into two identical LC oscillators are proposed, but these techniques are suitable for dividers with quadrature outputs.

For instance, it detects human faces from a QVGA image with 81% accuracy and consumes 0.47 mW/fps. Power consumption is 57times lower than that of conventional object recognition processors with comparable accuracy. A fair comparison, by taking technology differences into account, shows greater than 8times power efficiency. This processor detects speech from very short and low quality sound signals (72 ms in 10 s, 8 kHz, 8 b) recorded by a microphone in a sensor node. It also recognizes human activities such as walking, reading and typing from short and low quality 3D acceleration signals (2 s in 10 s, 50 Hz, 8 b) taken by an accelerometer. Recognition accuracy is over 90% in both applications. The versatility and low-power dissipation are attributed to optimal VLSI design from algorithm to architecture and circuit levels.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977351","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Face detection;Humans;Image recognition;Object recognition;Power dissipation;Signal processing;Speech processing;Wireless sensor networks","VLSI;image processing equipment;image recognition;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips;video equipment","3D acceleration signal;Haar-like feature;QVGA image;VLSI design;acceleration signals;accelerometer;cascaded classifier;human faces detection;image recognition;low power dissipation;low quality sound signal;power consumption;sound detection;versatile recognition processor;video detection;wireless sensor networks","","11","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, they benefit from replacing the bulky passive loop filter by a more cost-effective and flexible digital filter. The architecture of the presented ADPLL is composed of a dual-mode PFD, a PI digital loop filter composed of programmable integral (alpha) and proportional (beta) paths, a locking process monitor (LPM), an LC-based DCO, a divide-by-4 prescaler, and two phase accumulators PAC1 and PAC2. The PAC1 accumulates quarter of the frequency multiplication factor (N/4) while PAC2 accumulates the prescaler output phase. The phase difference (Phi<sub>E</sub>) between f<sub>REF</sub> and f<sub>OUT</sub>/N is then resolved by a subtractor.

"CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver with modal-dispersion equalizer for 10Gb/s 500m MMF transmission","Watanabe, D.; Ono, A.; Okayasu, T.","Advantest, Gunma, Japan","Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers, 2009. ISSCC 2009. IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","106","107,107a","Data communication over 300 m of distance, such as Ethernet standards, where the required data rate per channel reaches 10 Gb/s or more, demand optical transmission. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and multimode optical fiber (MMF) are usually used in such optical transmission systems, because they offer several advantages such as ease of assembly and optical alignment for cost reduction. The modulation frequency of commercial VCSEL devices is limited to approximately 10 GHz. To overcome this limitation, solutions have been reported by Palermo et al. (2006, 2007). However, these papers merely describe that the modulation frequency of VCSEL can be extended by equalization. On the other hand, the transmission performance of MMF is generally defined by the product of transmission distance and modulation frequency. In a commercial graded-index (Gl) MMF, the transmission performance stays about 500 MHz-km due to modal dispersion. In the case of 10 Gb/s data transmission, the required bandwidth for transmission medium is 10 GHz or more. Therefore, when using these commercial Gl MMF, the transmission distance will be limited to 50 m. Thus, when several hundred meters of transmission is achieved using MMF, the modal dispersion of MMF becomes a rather predominant transmission bottleneck than the use of VCSEL. To overcome this bottleneck, a 4-PAM VCSEL driver with an equalization scheme to compensate the modal dispersion of MMF is described in this paper. The driver is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS and achives 10 Gb/s 500 m 4-PAM transmission using conventional MMF having a 500 MHz-km of transmission bandwidth. Using this driver, the transmission distance with 10 Gb/s is extended by 10times (5 GHz-km).","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977330","","Bandwidth;Communication standards;Data communication;Equalizers;Ethernet networks;Fiber lasers;Frequency modulation;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical modulation;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","CMOS integrated circuits;data communication equipment;driver circuits;equalisers;gradient index optics;integrated optoelectronics;optical fibre communication;optical fibre dispersion;optical modulation;pulse amplitude modulation;surface emitting lasers","CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver fabrication;MMF transmission;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;data communication;data transmission;distance 500 m;equalization scheme;graded-index MMF;modal dispersion;modal-dispersion equalizer;multimode optical fiber;optical transmission system;pulse amplitude modulation;size 90 nm;vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser","","2","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge associated with this approach is how to achieve the proportional-path latency and gain required for overall low-noise DPLL performance. In particular, it is well-known that the strong nonlinearity introduced by the BB-PFD manifests itself as a bounded limit cycle. This results in the DPLL output jitter to increase as the proportional path latency and gain increase. To minimize the negative effect of the limit cycle, the DPLL architecture features a separate low-latency proportional path, with the BB- PFD output directly controlling the DCO. Other features include controllability of the proportional-path gain and of the BBPFD gain.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977324","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Clocks;Delay;Jitter;Optical buffering;Phase locked loops;Power supplies;Quantization;Varactors","digital phase locked loops;jitter;phase noise","bang-bang digital PLL;feedback clock;feedback phase jitter;fractional-N loop;frequency 11 GHz;frequency 20 GHz;high-speed serial communication application;integer-N BB-PFD DPLL architecture;low-phase-noise;proportional-path gain;proportional-path latency;reference clock;time-to-digital converter;wireline communication","","15","4","8","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","164","165,165a","In the interest of extending battery life in mobile systems that use pipelined ADCs, several power-efficient pipelined ADCs have recently been proposed. The most promising topologies reported thus far are those that substitute the opamp, which is the largest consumer of power in pipelined ADCs, with alternative and more power-efficient circuits. However, opamp-less pipelined ADCs thus far either: 1) require complex nonlinear calibration, 2) are single- ended, 3) are pseudo-differential, or 4) require a sampling scheme that limits linearity (less than 8b ENOB). In this paper, a low-power pipelined ADC is presented that has significantly lower power consumption than many previous 10b ADCs in the mid-to-high speed range. The ADC does not require power-hungry opamps, and hence achieves similar power savings. However, unlike prior opamp-free topologies, the ADC: 1) requires only stage-gain digital calibration, 2) uses fully differential pipelined stages, and 3) uses a sampling scheme that can achieve high linearity (SFDR of 66dB and better than 9b ENOB).","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977359","","Calibration;Capacitors;Charge pumps;Circuits;Clocks;Linearity;Pipelines;Sampling methods;Switches;Topology","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;charge pump circuits","CMOS;analog-digital convertor;capacitive charge-pump;lower power consumption;opamp-free topologies;pipelined ADC;power 9.9 mW;power-efficient circuit;size 0.18 mum","","4","2","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, the IEEE 802.15 WBAN task group has discussed the combining of wearable and implantable body sensor networks (BSNs), but no real chip implementation has been reported. In this paper, the implementation of a unified BSN is described. The unified BSN combines low-power body-channel communication (BCC) and versatile medical implant communication service (MICS) using a network controller located on the human body. This unified BSN has 2 main advantages over the conventional BSNs. First, the MICS band antenna shared with the BCC electrode can be attached directly to human skin to shorten the communication distances among the controller and implanted radios, relaxing their sensitivity and selectivity requirements. Second, due to low path loss of the human body channel, low-power communication is possible among the wearable devices. In addition, the on-body sensors do not need external antennas because the bio-signal sensing electrode functions as the interface for data transmission.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977489","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977489","","Biomedical electrodes;Body sensor networks;Communication system control;Dual band;Humans;Implants;Medical services;Microwave integrated circuits;Skin;Transceivers","biomedical communication;body area networks;multifrequency antennas;transceivers;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15 WBAN task group;MICS band antenna;MICS dual-band transceiver;implantable body sensor networks;implantable personal health care devices;low-power body-channel communication;medical implant communication service;on-body sensors;power 10.8 mW;unified body-sensor-network controller;wearable body sensor networks;wireless network","","3","","8","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The input impedance of a CG LNA is simplified as Mgm, and the noise factor is inversely proportional to gm.

While highly capable chips, these monolithic image sensors devote substantial perimeter area to signal acquisition and control circuitry and trade off pixel complexity for fill factor. For applications such as wide-area persistent surveillance, reconnaissance, and astronomical sky surveys it is desirable to have simultaneous near-real-time imagery with fast, wide field-of-view coverage. Since the fabrication of a complex large-format sensor on a single piece of silicon is cost and yield-prohibitive and is limited to the wafer size, for these applications many smaller-sized image sensors are tiled together to realize very large arrays. Ideally the tiled image sensor has no missing pixels and the pixel pitch is continuous across the seam to minimize loss of information content. CCD-based imagers have been favored for these large mosaic arrays because of their low noise and high sensitivity, but CMOS-based image sensors bring architectural benefits, including electronic shutters, enhanced radiation tolerance, and higher data-rate digital outputs that are more easily scalable to larger arrays. In this report the first back-illuminated, 1 Mpixel, 3D-integrated CMOS image sensor with 8 mum-pitch 3D via connections. The chip employs a conventional pixel layout and requires 500 mum of perimeter silicon to house the support circuitry and protect the array from saw damage. In this paper we present a back-illuminated 1 Mpixel CMOS image sensor tile that includes a 64-channel vertically integrated ADC chip stack, and requires only a few pixels of silicon perimeter to the pixel array. The tile and system connector design support 4-side abuttability and fast burst data rates.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977296","","CMOS image sensors;Circuits;Costs;Image sensors;Pixel;Sensor arrays;Silicon;Spatial resolution;Surveillance;Tiles","CMOS image sensors;analogue-digital conversion","ADC chip stack;CCD-based imager;CMOS image sensor;analog-digital converters;electronic shutter;monolithic image sensor;mosaic array;pixel array;signal acquisition","","15","1","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Magnetically labeled biosensors are proposed as a promising candidate to potentially eliminate or augment the optical instruments used by conventional fluorescence-based sensors. However magnetic biosensors developed thus far require externally generated magnetic biasing fields and/or exotic post-fabrication processes. This limits the ultimate form-factor of the system, total power consumption, and cost. To address these impediments, we present a low-power scalable frequency- shift magnetic particle biosensor array in bulk CMOS, which provides single- bead detection sensitivity without any (electrical or permanent) external magnets.

In a 10 GHz 3-stage comparator in 1.2 V 0.11 mum CMOS is presented and is designed to extract every 4<sup>th</sup> bit of a 40 Gb/s data stream. A BER<1012 for 1 V<sub>pp</sub> at the input is achieved. Depending of the intended application, the constant tail current and the low-voltage swing of the CML blocks may or may not be beneficial. In a latch-type sense amplifier (in 1.5V 0.13 mum CMOS) for use in SRAMs is investigated. The delay time is 119 ps for an input voltage difference of 100 mV. A disadvantage is that for proper operation a sufficiently large supply voltage is needed due to the stack of transistors and therefore the comparison time is longer than 11 ns at 0.7 V In a comparator with similar circuit structure in 1.8 V 0.18 mum CMOS is described, consuming 350 muW at 1.4 GHz. The standard deviation of the offset without compensation is delta=31.6 mV. The sense-amplifier presented (1.2V 90nm CMOS, 225 muW @ 2GHz) also consists of a typical latch with two cross-coupled CMOS inverters. The comparator (1.5V 0.12 mum CMOS, low-threshold transistors) reaches a sensitivity (BER=10-9) of 16.5 mV @ 4 GHz/1.5 V and 25.8 mV @ 500 MHz/0.5 V.

ISSCC 2009. IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","446","447,447a","The rapid advancement of processor technology has posed stringent challenges on power supply design. For high efficiency, switching converters are used. Frequent load switching requires the converters to have fast load transient response with recovery times in the order of mus, and therefore the switching frequency in the MHz range. The transient overshoot and undershoot voltages must be within 10% of the output voltage, and such specifications are difficult to meet for a processor core voltage of 0.8V. For fast load transient, inductor current should be fed forward to the PWM generator, which needs a high performance integrated current sensor. In the output feedforward (or V<sup>2</sup>) converter, inductor current is sensed by the equivalent series resistor (ESR) of the output capacitor instead. The generic implementation of a V<sup>2</sup> buck converter is shown in paper. The output voltage, V<sub>0</sub>, is fed back to the error-correction path (ECP) for precision output voltage control, and V<sub>0</sub> is also directly fed to the PWM generator through the feedforward path (FFP). It is shown that the output voltage ripple, DeltaV<sub>0</sub>, is dominated by Deltal<sub>lscr</sub>timesR<sub>ESR</sub>, and any change in V<sub>0</sub> requires the PWM generator to adjust the inductor current immediately, thus speeding up the response. However, to make sure that the V<sup>2</sup> converter operates properly without pulse skipping, a large ESR is needed. To eliminate a large ESR, a derivative-output-voltage (DOV) technique is suggested, to extract the inductor current ripple through differentiating V<sub>0</sub>. However, V<sub>0</sub> is a noisy node and is affected by frequent load changes, and therefore obtaining accurate current information is challenging.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977500","","Buck converters;Capacitors;Frequency conversion;Hysteresis;Inductors;Paramagnetic resonance;Power supplies;Pulse width modulation;Switching converters;Voltage","error correction;hysteresis;switching convertors;voltage control","PWM generator;derivative-output-voltage technique;equivalent series resistor;error-correction path;frequent load switching;output feedforward converter;power supply design;precision output voltage control;quasi-V<sup>2</sup> hysteretic buck converter;switching converters","","11","","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the considerable advantage of silicon lies in its natural capability for integration that will enable a higher level of complexity in such sensors. This paper presents a fully integrated 24GHz UWD radar sensor implemented in a 0.13mum SiGe BiCMOS process. The UWB signal generation takes advantage of a PLL. The produced 24.125GHz carrier is properly BPSK modulated to increase sensor robustness within the entire SRR sensor network.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977430","","Automotive applications;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Driver circuits;Germanium silicon alloys;Microwave sensors;Microwave technology;Road accidents;Road safety;Silicon germanium;Ultra wideband radar","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Ge-Si alloys;automotive electronics;phase shift keying;ultra wideband radar","BPSK modulation;PLL;SRR sensor network;SiGe BiCMOS process;UWB radar sensor;UWB signal generation;automotive applications;frequency 24.125 GHz;phase locked loop","","12","","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HR schemes are often used, but amplitude and phase mismatches limit HR to between 30 and 40 dB. A quick calculation shows that much more rejection is wanted: in order to bring harmonic responses down to the noise floor (e.g. -100 dBm in 10 MHz for 4 dB NF), and cope with interferers between -40 and 0 dBm, an HR of 60 to 100 dB is needed. Also in terrestrial TV receivers and in applications like DVB-H with co-existence requirements with GSM/WLAN transmitters in a small telephone, high HR is needed. In this work, an architecture aiming for >80 dB HR is shown. It consists of an analog front-end followed by adaptive interference cancellation (AIC) in the digital domain. AIC is known for its ability to adapt to and mitigate unknown system non-idealities, e.g. gain and phase imbalances. Due to its adaptivity it can achieve large improvements, provided the interference estimate is accurate. To the authors' knowledge, they are the first to explore AIC for HR and previously presented simulation results. Here a new and different architecture and measured results with the RF part implemented in 65 nm CMOS and the AIC in software are presented.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977393","","Digital video broadcasting;GSM;Interference cancellation;Noise measurement;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;TV receivers;Wideband;Wireless LAN","CMOS integrated circuits;harmonics suppression;interference suppression;radio receivers;software radio","CMOS;GSM transmitter;WLAN transmitter;adaptive interference cancellation;analog front-end;dual-domain harmonic rejection;frequency 400 MHz to 900 MHz;premixer RF filter;size 65 nm;software-defined radio;terrestrial TV receiver;wideband direct-conversion harmonic-rejection receivers","","15","1","7","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary innovation is to employ two different communication links (UWB and UHF) respectively in the uplink and downlink of the tag. This is because the amount of data or instructions from a reader to a tag is small and as a result a conventional UHF-RFID link at 900MHz can be used as the downlink. The UHF signal also provides remote power to the tag. The uplink requires higher data rates and precise positioning capability therefore an l-UWB transmitter is employed.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977376","","Binary phase shift keying;Clocks;Communication system control;Downlink;Passive RFID tags;Protocols;Pulse modulation;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Shape control","CMOS integrated circuits;radiofrequency identification;ultra wideband communication","CMOS;UHF downlink;UWB uplink;bit rate 100 Mbit/s;frequency 900 MHz;power 14.1 muW;remote-powered RFID tag;size 0.18 mum","","21","","7","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To compensate for this, the temperature of critical mechanical components must be measured with high resolution (<1 muK), typically by using precision thermistor bridges. Furthermore, this resolution must be maintained over several minutes, which means that the amplifier used for bridge readout should have a 1/f noise corner of only a few mHz. Such noise performance is well beyond the capabilities of currently available CMOS amplifiers. This paper describes a chopper current-feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) with a continuous-time (CT) ripple-reduction loop (RRL).The loop synchronously demodulates the amplifier's output ripple, and then drives it to zero by canceling the offset of the input stage. Due to the CT nature of the loop, it does not suffer from noise folding. By using a three-stage nested-Miller topology, and chopping the 1st and 2nd stages, the amplifier achieves a 1/f noise corner of 1mHz, a noise density of 15nV/radicHz and an offset of less than 5 muV. Furthermore, the combination of chopping and the use of a current- feedback topology results in a DC CMRR of greater than 130dB.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977438","","Bridges;Choppers;Instruments;Mechanical variables measurement;Mechatronics;Noise cancellation;Temperature;Thermal expansion;Thermistors;Topology","1/f noise;CMOS integrated circuits;choppers (circuits);feedback amplifiers;integrated circuit noise","1/f noise;CMOS amplifiers;chopper current-feedback instrumentation amplifier;continuous-time ripple-reduction loop;noise density;three-stage nested-Miller topology","","0","4","8","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way of reducing DFE power consumption is to use current-integrating summers. Previously published current-integrating DFEs operating above 5 Gb/s were demonstrated on simple test chips lacking support circuitry for CDR and DFE adaptation functions. The architecture presented here includes additional data paths based on current-integrating summers to realize a fully integrated RX with CDR and continuous DFE adaptation.

The design of a MEMS microphone, consisting of a compliant membrane and a stiff back-plate forming a variable capacitor, is a challenging task with a number of design trade-offs. For cost reasons, a small-area membrane is desired; however, lower acoustical noise is obtained with a larger membrane. In this work, we demonstrate a method to increase the SNR of a microphone system without the need for a complicated and risky MEMS die redesign. An SNR of 66 dB is achieved using two microphones (instead of a single one) in a differential configuration, thus doubling the total membrane area.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977452","","Biomembranes;Capacitors;Consumer electronics;Electrets;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Lead;Micromechanical devices;Microphones;Signal to noise ratio;Silicon","CMOS integrated circuits;elemental semiconductors;micromechanical devices;microphones;silicon","CMOS MEMS microphone;MEMS die redesign;Si;acoustical noise;electret condenser microphones;high-volume consumer electronic product;lead-free solder reflow cycles;stiff back-plate forming;variable capacitor","","6","","12","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Connecting multiple outdoor units (ODU) to the set-top boxes traditionally needed multiple cables. A first step has been achieved with so-called satellite channel stacking switch<sup>TM</sup> technology (CSS), able to deliver the full suite of TV programs to all STBs in a single home through a reduced number of cables. However, this pure analog/RF technology does not offer enough flexibility in terms of the number of simultaneous users (12 users maximum) and requires multiple external components like SAW filters, increasing significantly the cost of the solution. Introducing digital processing in this RF dominated application to sort and assemble user channels removes the need of in-band SAW filters, offers full flexibility of channel selection, and supports up to 50 users simultaneously. This digital channel multiplexer (DCM) solution is a transceiver located in the ODU. It receives the satellite signal from the LNB after down conversion to an intermediate frequency (IF), and transmits the channels selected by the users on a single cable to multiple STBs. Each user has some reserved bandwidth on the output signal. The visualisation of the chips, the functions and the block diagram of DCM are also illustrated.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977406","","Cable TV;Digital TV;Multiplexing;Radio frequency;SAW filters;Satellite broadcasting;Switches;TV broadcasting;Transceivers;US Department of Transportation","CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital video broadcasting;direct broadcasting by satellite;multiplexing equipment;transceivers","CMOS transceiver;SAW filter;analog-RF technology;digital channel multiplexer;digital processing;frequency 1 GHz;in-band SAW filter;intermediate frequency;multiple cable;multiple low-noise block head;multituner set-top box;satellite channel stacking switch technology;satellite outdoor unit;size 65 nm","","1","","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the targeted band of 9 GHz (plus margin for process variations) is divided in two parts, each part being covered by a separate oscillator. This relaxes the tunability requirements for each oscillator. To enable direct conversion, the PLL uses quadrature VCOs (QVCOs) having quadrature signals at the output. The outputs of both QVCOs are buffered and multiplexed by a frequency selector. Next, the wideband frequency divider chain is realized with an injection-locked divide-by-4 prescaler, followed by a divide-by-2 prescaler and an integer-N frequency divider. A frequency counter at the output of the divider is read via a shift register and used to calibrate the PLL. A phase-frequency detector (PFD), a charge pump (CP) and a 3rd-order active loop filter complete this 4th-order type-ll PLL.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977524","","CMOS technology;Charge pumps;Counting circuits;Frequency conversion;Injection-locked oscillators;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Shift registers;Wideband","CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital phase locked loops;field effect MIMIC;frequency dividers;millimetre wave oscillators;phase locked oscillators;voltage-controlled oscillators","3rd-order active loop filter;4th-order type-ll PLL;bandwidth 9 GHz;charge pump;digital CMOS circuit;divide-by-2 prescaler;frequency 57 GHz to 66 GHz;frequency counter;frequency selector;injection-locked divide-by-4 ring oscillator;integer-N frequency divider;oscillator tunability;phase-frequency detector;quadrature PLL;quadrature VCO;shift register;size 45 nm;wideband frequency divider chain","","28","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various types of radiation, from cosmic rays to high-energy proton beams to gamma radiation, have an effect on the functionality and accuracy of imagers and the literature is extensive. Techniques to maximize sensor tolerance have also been developed for a number of years and several imagers resistant to up to 30Mrad (Si) of gamma radiation have been reported. These sensors have several shortcomings: either significant noise performance degradation, up to several orders of magnitude, or unacceptably high pre-radiation noise levels. In addition, many radiation-tolerant sensors use dedicated processes, thus possibly limiting their suitability for mass-market applications. This paper describes a CMOS photon-counting imager designed to detect the Earth's airglow, which is the atmospheric oxygen emission at 762 nm due to oxygen recombination. Airglow occurs day and night and enables geostationary and orbiting satellites to infer their position referred to the Earth's center for attitude determination.

It contains a radio controller with sleep timer and can perform higher-level MAC functions such as beacon detection and network timing synchronisation autonomously, thereby enabling significant power savings in the overall system. The primary design goal for the receive path is to achieve excellent channel selectivity and dynamic range combined with good sensitivity at very low power consumption, all of which are important parameters for the reliable operation of WSN in the harsh 2.4GHz ISM band. The receiver uses a direct-conversion architecture and offers up to 20dB improved interference rejection in the adjacent channels compared to recently published WPAN transceivers based on the low-IF architecture. Further emphasizing WSN reliability, the receiver supports switched antenna diversity to mitigate multipath fading. Implemented in a 1P6M 0.18mum RFCMOS process, the IC occupies a die area of less than 5.9mmA It operates with a supply voltage from 1.8V to 3.6V, draws 16.8mA in receive mode and 18mA when transmitting at 3dBm.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977484","","Control systems;Dynamic range;Energy consumption;Radio control;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Receivers;Timing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","CMOS integrated circuits;diversity reception;personal area networks;radio receivers;synchronisation;transceivers;wireless sensor networks","IEEE802.15.4 WPAN;beacon detection;direct-conversion diversity receiver;frequency 2.6 GHz;highly integrated low-power transceiver;low-power RF transceiver;network timing synchronisation;size 0.18 mum;wireless sensor networks","","8","","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The limited energy from power sources, typically either microfabricated batteries or scavenged energy, remains one of the biggest challenges for such platforms. Reducing power consumption can lower system volume and extend lifetime. To achieve very low power consumption aggressive voltage scaling has been applied in recent microsystems. The average power consumption of sensor platforms, which are often low duty cycle, can be greatly reduced by applying strong power gating while idling. A key component in power gating is the timekeeping device while the system is in the idle mode. Since the timer is always active, it is often the dominant source for energy loss and must oscillate at a low frequency (e.g., from sub-Hzto 10Hz).","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977440","","Circuits;Energy consumption;Frequency;Gate leakage;MOSFETs;Ocean temperature;Oscillators;Temperature sensors;Testing;Voltage","energy conservation;sensors;timing circuits","energy loss;energy scavenging;implantable medical devices;power consumption reduction;program-and-hold timer;sensor platforms;ultralow-power sensor platforms","","11","","5","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, leading-edge low-voltage designs are pushing FET operation into the weak inversion and subthreshold regimes. Investigators around the world are reporting circuits at voltages between 180mV and 700mV that offer performance which could support a range of applications in wireless sensors, mobile phones, biomedical devices, and ultra-mobile PCs. However, these circuits are highly sensitive to variations in temperature and process. Ultra-low-voltage circuits will be increasingly challenging to design as feature sizes shrink. Current trends indicate nominal supply voltages are unlikely to be reduced much below 1V, transistor threshold voltages will likely remain between 0.3 and 0.4V to manage subthreshold leakage, and effects such as random- dopant fluctuation will increase the spread in transistor parameters, all of which create difficulties in designing robust circuits at low V<inf>DD</inf>.

Seamless switching between WiMAX and WLAN is envisioned as a means to enable users to stay connected anywhere and anytime. A low-cost low-power small-form-factor dual-mode (802.16e and 802.11b/g/n) dual-band (2.3G to 2.7G and 3.3G to 3.9G) 2x2 MIMO direct-conversion radio in 90 nm CMOS has been developed to address this rapidly growing market. The transceiver supports wide dual-frequency bands and multiple signal bandwidths of 3.5, 5, 7,10,14, 20, and 40 MHz for worldwide dual-mode operations. Many key challenges in WiMAX direct-conversion transceiver design stem from its small subcarrier spacing, which is necessary to combat multipath fading of OFDM signals in 125 km/h mobile vehicular environments. With the first subcarrier as close as 7.8125 kHz to DC, stringent requirements are imposed on RX and TX flicker noise, TX LO leakage, and LO settling time. Flicker noise in RX is greatly reduced with the adoption of a passive mixer. Several other circuit techniques, system optimizations, and build-in self-calibrations including DC offset with dynamic bandwidth control, IQ mismatch, TX LO leakage, filter bandwidth, LO frequency and amplitude calibrations are used to accomplish high transceiver performance. The chip also achieves excellent WiMAX/WiFi/BIuetooth/GPS/cellular co-existence performance owing to high RX linearity, robust high dynamic range RX AGC with smart blocker detection, and low TX noise. Ultra-wide RX input-signal dynamic range with EVM of better than -35dB to support MIMO 64-QAM OFDM application is achieved. A well-balanced TX gain control scheme is devised to obtain a very wide range of output power with EVM better than -35 dB.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977485","","1f noise;Bandwidth;Broadband communication;Dual band;Dynamic range;MIMO;OFDM;Transceivers;WiMAX;Wireless LAN","CMOS integrated circuits;MIMO communication;WiMax;field effect MMIC;transceivers;wireless LAN","64-QAM application;IEEE 802.16e;OFDM signal;WiMAX-WLAN application;bandwidth 10 MHz;bandwidth 14 MHz;bandwidth 20 MHz;bandwidth 3.5 MHz;bandwidth 40 MHz;bandwidth 5 MHz;bandwidth 7 MHz;broadband wireless communication;dual band dual mode direct-conversion CMOS transceiver;frequency 2.3 GHz to 2.7 GHz;frequency 3.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz;fully integrated MIMO transceiver;high data-rate communication;mobile vehicular environment;multipath fading;multiple signal bandwidth;size 90 nm;ultrawide RX input-signal dynamic range;well-balanced TX gain control scheme","","2","","2","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even a low gain of 6dB can clip OdBm OBI to a 1.2V supply, blocking the receiver. Hard-switching mixers not only translate the wanted signal to baseband but also the interference around LO harmonics. Harmonic rejection (HR) mixers have been used, but are sensitive to phase and gain mismatch. Indeed the HR in shows a large spread, whereas other work only shows results from one chip.

Wireless systems heavily rely on the phase-locked-loop, but recent shifts into nanometer CMOS processes for RF SoCs open new architectural opportunities for all-digital and digitally-intensive implementations, both for carrier frequency synthesis and for phase-modulated transmission schemes. Data converter performance has improved so much that ADC performance is now limited as much by the clock-path noise and jitter, as by the quantization or thermal noise of the input signal path.

In particular, the noise added in-band trades off with the linearity required to handle close out-of-band interferers [1]. Since the integrated noise generally is proportional to kT/C, once the noise floor for the filter is set, the amount of capacitance is roughly defined as well as a lower bound for area and power consumption. The solution presented in this paper aims to break this trade off by inserting an in-band zero in the output noise transfer function to improve the dynamic range.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977445","","Band pass filters;Bandwidth;Capacitance;Circuit noise;Cutoff frequency;Impedance;Linearity;Noise figure;Noise reduction;Passband","band-pass filters;transfer functions","SFDR CT filter;baseband filter;direct-conversion wireless receiver;inband noise reduction;noise figure 75 dB;out-of-band interferers;power 1.25 mW;spurious free dynamic range;transfer function","","5","","3","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hopping generator allows the generation of 56 accurate channels with a single frequency source, making FCC compliant FHSS possible in the ISM bands (915 and 2400 MHz) at a power dissipation of only 325 muW, which is more than an order of magnitude less than existing state-of-the-art fast-hopping synthesizers.

The most commonly used architecture is a dual-loop CDR where a DLL (or PLL) generates k equidistantly spaced clock phases that are fed into n/2 phase rotators, where n is the number of sampling latches in the CDR. Another method was proposed, where the multi-phase generation and phase shifting is achieved at the same time in a single PLL, in this case achieving phase-adjustment capability through the weighted summing of charge-pump outputs for several phases. This approach eliminates the additional delay associated with using phase rotators and simplifies the overall design. However, all these conventional methods require either a PLL or a DLL, blocks that demand the largest share of power consumption and of silicon area in the CDR circuit. An alternate approach to implementing a phase generator and rotator is described in this paper, with the basic design concept of this approach is also illustrated.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977326","","Circuit testing;Clocks;Filters;Frequency;Interpolation;Inverters;Jitter;Leg;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement","CMOS digital integrated circuits;MMIC;UHF generation;UHF integrated circuits;clock and data recovery circuits;digital phase locked loops;microwave generation;silicon-on-insulator","SOI CMOS;all-digital phase generator-rotator;charge-pump output;frequency 0.8 GHz to 5 GHz;multiphase generator;phase shifting;power 5.4 mW;power consumption;serial link receiver;size 45 nm","","0","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Time-Interleaved (Tl) successive-approximation-register-based (SAR) ADCs are ideally suited to these applications due to their highly scalable architecture and due to the steady improvement in matching and density of metal-finger capacitors (MFC). This paper presents a Tl C-2C SAR ADC that achieves high performance by using: (1) a small-area C-2C SAR architecture with low input capacitance; (2) high-speed boosted switches to overcome high device threshold; (3) background comparator offset calibration and radix calibration; and (4) redundant-ADC-based gain, offset and timing calibration to reduce Tl errors.","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977315","","Baseband;CMOS process;Calibration;Capacitance;Capacitors;Digital signal processing;Performance gain;Process design;Switches;Timing","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;low-power electronics","C-2C SAR ADC;analog-digital convertor;comparator offset calibration;high-speed boosted switches;high-speed communication system;low input capacitance;low-power digital CMOS process;metal-finger capacitors;power 50 mW;radix calibration;size 45 nm;time-interleaved successive-approximation-register;voltage 1.1 V;word length 7 bit","","23","5","4","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increased downconverter dynamic range is thus required for a SAW-less RX path. In addition, avoiding SNR degradation from reciprocal mixing imposes additional constraints on LO phase noise.

The past trend of using smaller transistors to build larger microprocessor cores operating at higher frequency and consuming more power is also at an end. The new era of microprocessor scaling is a system-on-a-chip approach that combines a diverse set of components using adaptive circuits, integrated sensors, sophisticated power-management techniques, and increased parallelism to build products that are many-core, multi-core, and multi-function.

The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side. The CCM is a CCD-specific efficient signal-amplification device. CCM, combined with the BSI structure and cooling, achieved very high sensitivity.

Since the conventional intra-panel interfaces with multi-drop configurations, such as RSDS and mini-LVDS, increase the cost of overall systems at high bandwidth, new intra panel interfaces have been proposed to meet the bandwidth requirement with point-to-point configurations. This paper presents a new high-speed video interface that offers significant complexity reduction in the receiver. It is because receivers are integrated in a DDI with relatively slow high-voltage processes, while transmitters in host controllers are implemented with the more advanced deep-submicron processes. Compared to the PLL-based clock recovery circuits in [K. Yamguchi et al., 2009; I. Jung et al., 2009], the DLL-based data recovery circuit occupies a smaller area with lower power consumption and offers unconditionally stable characteristics along with higher jitter tolerance.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746393","","Clocks;Delay;Jitter;Logic gates;Phase frequency detector;Receivers","display devices;phase locked loops;video signals","DLL-based data recovery circuit;PLL-based clock recovery circuit;bandwidth requirement;clock-embedded video interface;complexity reduction;deep-submicron process;display driver IC;high-speed video interface;jitter tolerance;multidrop configuration;panel interface;point-to-point configuration;power 13.8 mW;video data","","1","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A 6Gb/s receiver with 32.7dB adaptive DFE-IIR equalization","Yi-Chieh Huang; Shen-Iuan Liu","Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2011 IEEE International","20110407","2011","","","356","358","To ensure the signal integrity over a lossy channel, an analog equalizer and/or a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are widely adopted in high-speed data transmission. An adaptive analog equalizer or adaptive DFE is also attractive to compensate the frequency-dependent loss due to the different channel lengths and environment variations. Conventionally, a multiple-tap DFE is adopted to compensate the inter-symbol interference (ISI), which is induced by postcursors due to the non-ideal channel impulse responses. To avoid the power and area penalty due to many postcursors, a DFE with infinite impulse response (MR) filter feedback has been presented. In [B. Kim et al., 2009], no adaptation scheme ensures that such MR filter cancels the postcursors precisely, i.e., its RC time constant and amplitude need to be manually adjusted. In this work, a 6Gb/s receiver using a DFE with an adaptive continuous-time MR filter and a clock/data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented. In a high loss environment, a conventional digital qaudricor relator frequency detector (QFD) may fail due to the significant data dependent jitter. To integrate an adaptive DFE with a CDR circuit, a proposed frequency sweeping frequency detector (FD) and a lock detector (LD) are presented in this work.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746352","","Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Detectors;Frequency measurement;IIR filters;Jitter;Receivers","IIR filters;clock and data recovery circuits;intersymbol interference","adaptive DFE-IIR equalization;adaptive analog equalizer;adaptive continuous-time MR filter;channel impulse response;clock/data recovery circuit;data dependent jitter;decision feedback equalizer;digital qaudricor relator frequency detector;frequency sweeping frequency detector;frequency-dependent loss;high speed data transmission;infinite impulse response filter feedback;intersymbol interference;lock detector;lossy channel;receiver;signal integrity","","0","","6","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
