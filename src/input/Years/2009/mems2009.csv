The temperature dependency can be reduced through thermal oxidation of the resonator (Melamud et al., 2007). However, in this paper it is concluded that thickness control of the oxidation layer has a major influence on the absolute frequency, besides on the temperature drift, and as such dominates the frequency spread of a MEMS resonator after production including oxidation. This is a result of the large difference in Young's modulus of Si and SiO<sub>2</sub> and the added mass due to oxidation. The overall frequency range in operation - including both thermal drift range and spread in absolute frequency - can even deteriorate, rather than improve, through thermal oxidation, depending on the accuracy at which the oxide thickness is controlled.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805467","","Micromechanical devices;Optical resonators;Oscillators;Oxidation;Resonance;Resonant frequency;Silicon;Temperature dependence;Thickness control;Vibration measurement","micromechanical resonators;oscillators;oxidation;oxygen compounds;silicon compounds","MEMS based oscillators;MEMS resonator;SiO<sub>2</sub>;Young modulus;on temperature drift and absolute frequency;resonance frequency;thermal oxidation","","1","2","5","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was found that the strength of the ODEP force induced on the hydrogenated amorphous silicon surface is determined by the wavelength of the illuminating patterns. Therefore two moving lines and one stationary illuminated line which produced the ODEP forces as virtual electrodes were first defined by projecting lights onto a photoconductive chip. The moving lines and one stationary illuminated line were used to generate a stronger and a weaker ODEP force, respectively. As the moving lines approached to the weaker line, micro-particles between them were concentrated by the higher ODEP forces and squeezed through the stationary electrode. Finally, lager micro-particles were subsequently separated from the smaller particles. With this approach, continuous particle separation can be automatically achieved in a short period of time. This developed method may be promising for a variety of applications such as cell-based assays and sample pre-treatment using micro-particles.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805315","","Amorphous silicon;Biomedical optical imaging;Dielectrics;Dielectrophoresis;Electrodes;Glass;Indium tin oxide;Optical devices;Optical surface waves;Surface waves","electrophoresis;elemental semiconductors;hydrogen;photoconducting devices;silicon","Si:H;cell-based assays;hydrogenated amorphous silicon surface;microparticle separation;optically-induced dielectrophoretic forces;photoconductive chip;stationary electrode;stationary illuminated line;virtual electrodes","","2","","13","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The device implements a switchable air gap capacitor and is therefore not limited in lifetime by dielectric charging as opposed to contact-type capacitive switches implementing high-k dielectrics. It is shown how these switched capacitors, even though having a capacitance ratio of only 2.8, can still form adequate switching devices and RF-circuits by proper design and combining of these devices with high-Q inductors and transmission lines. The novelty of the proposed process is that it combines a sacrificial layer consisting of a single layer with a single dry etching step for the dimples which define the air gap in the down-state. This airgap is switched by electrostatic actuation of a thick electroplated nickel bridge-structure. The device is realized in a 4-lithographic steps process with low complexity and high robustness.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805518","","Capacitance;Capacitors;Dielectric devices;Electrostatics;Fabrication;High-K gate dielectrics;Microswitches;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Robustness;Switches","air gaps;capacitor switching;circuit complexity;electrostatic devices;inductors;microswitches","capacitance ratio;contact-type capacitive switches;dielectric charging;electrostatic actuation;frequency 100 Hz;high-Q inductor;high-k dielectrics;lithographic steps process;robust air gap-based MEMS switch technology;single dry etching step;switchable air gap capacitor;thick electroplated nickel bridge-structure;transmission line;unipolar actuation","","1","","7","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is demonstrated that the stability of the drive-mode oscillations significantly improves by using a compensation capacitor across resistive preamplifiers of drive-mode oscillator output when the oscillator is driven by square-wave input signal generated by conventional automatic gain control (AGC) loops.

The relative phase shift of 45deg of a single stage is achieved by vertically moving a lambda/2-long high-resistivity silicon dielectric block above a 3D micromachined coplanar waveguide (3D CPW) by electrostatic actuation, resulting in different propagation constants of the microwave signal for the up-state and the down-state. For full 360deg phase-shift capability, seven stages are cascaded. The devices are fabricated and assembled by wafer-scale processes using bulk and surface micromachining. The measurement results of the first prototypes show that the W-band return and insertion loss of a single 45deg stage is better than -15 dB and -1.7 dB, respectively, while the 7-stage phase shifter has a return loss better than -12 dB with an insertion loss less than -4 dB. The phase shifters also perform well from 1-110 GHz with the return loss better than -10 dB, an insertion loss of less than -1.5 dB and a fairly linear phase-shift over the whole frequency range and the actuation voltage is 30 V. To the knowledge of the authors this phase shifter is better than all previous works in term of insertion loss, return loss and phase shift per losses (deg/dB) from 70-100 GHz.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805307","","Assembly;Coplanar waveguides;Dielectrics;Electrostatic actuators;Insertion loss;Micromechanical devices;Microwave devices;Phase shifters;Propagation constant;Silicon","coplanar waveguides;electrostatic actuators;micromachining;microwave circuits;microwave phase shifters","3D micromachined coplanar waveguide;W-band insertion loss;W-band return loss;actuation voltage;bulk micromachining;down-state;electrostatic actuation;frequency 1 GHz to 110 GHz;high-resistivity silicon dielectric block;phase shift;reconfigurable 7X45deg multi-stage dielectric-block phase shifter;surface micromachining;ultra-broadband multi-stage digital-type microwave MEMS phase shifters;up-state;voltage 30 V;wafer-scale processes","","3","","5","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As reported in Transducers 2007, two-curve fitting of Raman spectrum was useful for analyzing stress magnitude at the edge of convex structures. In this study, the partial least-square (PLS) method was adopted for the obtained Raman spectra at the convex edge in order to determine stress components as well as their magnitudes.

Vibration induced by air flow was measured by the piezoelectric material of PZT on the silicon cantilever beam. Theoretical resonant frequency of the cantilever beam (610 mum times 300 mum times 3.3 mum) was 12,416 Hz. For the air flow velocities of 2.8 m/sec and 9.7 m/sec, shifted resonant frequencies were 12,810 Hz and 15,602 Hz, respectively.

Specifically, the introduction of slots along the output axis of a 53-MHz wine-glass mode disk resonator structure realizes a single gain stage with a measured input-to-output displacement amplification of 3.08 x. Multiple such mechanical displacement gain stages can then be cascaded in series via half-wavelength beam couplers to achieve multiplicative gain factors; e.g., two cascaded gain stages achieve a total measured gain of 7.94 x. The devices have also been operated as resonant switches, where displacement gain allows impact switching via actuation voltages of only 400 mV, which is 6 x smaller than for previous reso switches without displacement gain. The availability of such high frequency displacement gain strategies for resonant switches may soon allow purely mechanical periodic switching applications (such as power amplifiers and power converters) with much higher efficiencies than current transistor-based versions.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805308","","Availability;Couplers;Displacement measurement;Frequency conversion;Gain measurement;Mechanical variables measurement;Micromechanical devices;Resonance;Switches;Voltage","VHF devices;microswitches;resonance;resonators","frequency 53 MHz;half-wavelength beam coupler;high frequency displacement gain;impact switching;mechanical displacement gain stages;mechanical periodic switching;micromechanical resonant displacement gain stages;resonant structures;resonant switches;wine glass mode disk resonator structure","","1","","7","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using new paradigms of biological inspiration and understanding of electron transfer mechanism in biological systems, we have created quantized Plasmon Resonance Energy Transfer (PRET) nanospectroscopy for molecular imaging of living cells (Fig. 1). For the remote optical control of gene regulation and protein expression, we have developed Oligonucleotides on a Nanoplasmonic Carrier Optical Switch (ONCOS). ONCOS allows on-demand gene silencing with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and localized temperature disturbance in living cells. The ONCOS and PRET will be used for experimental system biology, molecular/cellular diagnostics, and therapeutic applications since it will provide us precise spatial and temporal information of living cellular mechanism. Bionanophotonic molecular ruler is accomplished to measure the dynamics of DNA and protein interactions. In-vivo Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) probes, in-vitro integrated nanofluidic SERS, and optofluidic microprocessors are developed for label-free molecular diagnostics and drug discovery.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805317","","Biological systems;Biomedical imaging;Cells (biology);Electrons;Energy exchange;Medical diagnostic imaging;Nanobioscience;Plasmons;Resonance;Technological innovation","DNA;application specific integrated circuits;bio-optics;bioMEMS;biomedical electronics;cellular biophysics;genetics;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;nanophotonics;proteins;surface enhanced Raman scattering","BioASICs;DNA;ONCOS;Oligonucleotides on a Nanoplasmonic Carrier Optical Switch;PRET nanospectroscopy;biomedical innovations;cellular diagnostics;drug discovery;electron transfer mechanism;gene regulation;in-vitro integrated nanofluidic SERS;in-vivo surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy;label-free molecular diagnostics;living cellular mechanism;molecular imaging;nanobiophotonics;on-demand gene silencing;optofluidic microprocessors;protein expression;protein interactions;quantized plasmon resonance energy transfer","","0","","","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 22nd International Conference on","20090327","2009","","","785","788","We propose a tactile sensor with standing cantilevers embedded in viscous liquid. The viscous liquid was covered with an elastic body. Since the micro cantilevers were kept free in the liquid, they can detect large shear forces without damaging. When shear forces were applied to the sensor surface, they deform the elastic body and the viscous liquid. Since the standing cantilevers follow deformations of viscous liquid, shear forces can be detected with resistance changes of the cantilevers. If the shear force was kept constant, the cantilevers in liquid return to their initial posture. From this mechanism, the proposed sensor can detect the change of shear forces without damaging. Since the standing cantilever in single liquid filter detect the force applied to its surface. It becomes difficult to detect the contact position with the proposed sensor. Therefore, we arranged channel in the liquid filter to control the liquid flow. By arranging standing cantilevers into the channel, the cantilever's resistance changes with the distance from the contact position. In this paper, we measured the relationship between the contact position and the resistance changes of the cantilevers arranged in channel.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805500","","Electrical resistance measurement;Filters;Force measurement;Force sensors;Image sensors;Immune system;Piezoresistance;Robot sensing systems;Surface resistance;Tactile sensors","cantilevers;deformation;force measurement;force sensors;microchannel flow;microsensors;piezoresistive devices;tactile sensors","cantilever resistance;elastic body;flexible tactile sensor sheet;liquid filter;liquid flow control;micro cantilever;piezoresistive cantilever;shear force detection;standing cantilever;viscous liquid","","3","","7","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By way of enriching rarefied cocaine samples, this detection limit is further improved to 10 pM. Additionally, the device utilizes temperature-dependent reversibility of aptamer-analyte binding to regenerate the sensor surface at a relatively modest temperature (40degC).

This minimizes the wall contact of the liquid plug and reduces contact line friction. Individual droplets of liquid metal can be pneumatically generated by interplay of the sheathing gas flow in the outer grooves of the nozzle and the liquid metal. The working principle was first discovered and studied by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. For experimental validation silicon chips with the star-shaped geometry were fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and assembled into a printhead. With different nozzle chips volumes between 120 pl and 3.6 nl could be generated at natural frequencies of 90 Hz and 400 Hz. The StarJet can either be operated as drop on demand or as continuous droplet dispenser.

To solve this problem, we propose the fabrication technique where firstly display components are constructed on flat plastic foils and the foils are, then, processed to form them into coiled yarns. In detail of the process, organic electrochromic displays are fabricated on the releasable parylene films above the glass. The foils with displays are cut into yarns with dicing cutters and released from the glass. To make yarns stretchable, the resultant foils are spirally rolled around elastic core fibers, forming helical coiled structure.

Wafer-level testing with a pull-in/pull-out voltage technique and current compliant source was used to detect stiction on capped and uncapped wafers. Devices capped in dry Nitrogen environment were found to be sticky at both the wafer-level pull-in/pull-out test as well as the packaged part tap test. Although uncapped devices did not show stiction in a room environment using the pull-in/pull-out detection technique, successive drops in pull-out voltage were detected as the conditions of the test control chamber became drier. The ability of the anti-stiction coating to retain charge was analyzed using KLA-Tencor Quantox XP system where the deposited charge decayed in 6 minutes when measured in room air conditions. Successive pull-in/pull-out cycles separated by a delay of 15 seconds showed decay in pull-out voltage of 22 mV/cycle.

This paper describes how to overcome these limitations with a combination of anisotropic micromachining, UV definable polymers and low temperature bonding. The functionality of these actuators is proven by extensive measurements which showed that actuation forces of 0.1 N can be achieved for actuators with an active cross-section of 0.15 mm<sup>2</sup>.

Selective binding of prostate cancer cells to a surface functionalized with anti-N-cadherin antibodies utilizing a microfluidic system under flow conditions has been studied. Here, the behavior of a captured cell under a time-dependent flow field is investigated experimentally and numerically. Under slowly increasing flow rate, the cell deformation is more pronounced resulting in lower drag force on attached cells. Furthermore, the contact area between the cell and the functionalized surface is larger, potentially enhancing the cell adhesion force. Consequently, a higher flow rate is required to detach cells exposed to such a flow field. Numerical simulations have been utilized in effort to quantify the required detachment force. The results confirm that to obtain a similar shear stress, a higher flow rate is needed for attached cells under lower flow acceleration.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805411","","Acceleration;Adhesives;Blood;Cancer;Etching;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Stress;Surface fitting;Tumors","adhesion;biological fluid dynamics;biomechanics;cancer;cellular transport;microfluidics","adhesion force;anti-N-cadherin antibodies;cell deformation;cell detachment;flow acceleration;microfluidic system;prostate cancer cells;selective binding;shear stress;time dependent flow field","","1","","12","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a proof of concept, a mini water-floating boat of centimeter size is fabricated from a thin plastic foil of which outer surfaces are covered with microfabricated EWOD electrodes. Applying a voltage to the electrodes changes the symmetric configuration of surface tension on the boat, resulting in generation of propulsion and rotation in the boat. By energizing the frontal or rear EWOD electrode, linear propulsion of the boat is achieved. The maximum speed is measured to be 5 mm/s. In addition, energizing two diagonal side EWOD electrodes on the boat surface generates rotational motion at the maximum rotational speed of 20 rpm. Finally, by combining the linear propulsion and rotational actuation, a curvilinear motion with controllability is demonstrated.

Our design of the superhydrophobic channel creates an automatic adjustment of the gas pressure in the lubricating air layer to the local liquid pressure in the channel. This is achieved by pneumatically connecting the liquid in the microchannel to the air pockets trapped at channel wall trough a pressure feedback channel. When liquid enters the feedback channel it compresses the air and increases the pressure in the air pocket. This reduces the pressure drop over the air-liquid interface and increases the maximum sustainable liquid pressure. We define a dimensionless fluidic number, W<sub>F</sub> = P<sub>L</sub>D<sub>h</sub>thetas<sub>c</sub>, which expresses the fluidic energy carrying capacity of a superhydrophobic microchannel. We experimentally verified that our geometry can sustain several times higher liquid pressure before collapsing, and we measured better friction reducing properties at higher W<sub>F</sub> values than in previous works. This method could be applicable for reducing near-wall laminar friction in both micro- and macroscale flows.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805313","","Feedback;Fluid flow;Friction;Geometry;Hydraulic diameter;Hydrodynamics;Lubrication;Microchannel;Pressure control;Programmable control","friction;hydrophobicity;laminar flow;microchannel flow","air-liquid interface;dimensionless fluidic number;feedback channel;fluidic energy carrying capacity;friction losses;high liquid pressures;large liquid flows;lubricating air layer;microchannels;near-wall laminar friction;self-regulating method;superhydrophobic surface","","0","","6","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to our previous work [1], the system now is truly portable. In any orientation of the DMFC, a bubble driven self regulating supply mechanism safely removes carbon dioxide and transports at least 3.5 times more methanol to the anode than critically needed to sustain DMFC operation. On the cathode, diffusive oxygen supply and the transport of the reaction product water along a capillary gradient out of the DMFC ensures a stable performance. Compared to our previous work [1], the power output was increased by a factor of 2.5 and reached p = 5.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. A stable power output for 40 hours of p = 4 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> was achieved for the preferred vertical position with bubbles moving against buoyancy forces.

PBA is characterized by small, soft, and safe (S<sup>3</sup>) features because of its soft and flexible structure and safe driving principle. A single PBA bends due to a tensile force generated by a swelling balloon. Bending motion of PBA is transformed into the telescopic motion by using a paired PBA. Two opposing PBAs are bonded at both ends so as to compose a paired PBA. The paired PBA transforms the bending motion into the telescopic motion. An elemental telescopic motion PBA composed of a paired PBA (2 mm times 11 mm times 400 mum) can generate 15 mN contraction force at 150 kPa. It is also possible to design serial or parallel connection of the telescopic motion PBA. This paper presents design, fabrication, and characterization of proposed telescopic motion PBA.

However, inherent problems in the plasma processes, such as charge buildup and UV photon radiation, limit the etching performance for nanoscale devices. To overcome these problems and fabricate sub-10-nm devices in practice, neutral-beam etching has been proposed.

Width-extensional mode silicon resonators are heated by passing a current through their resonating elements. This causes a mass loading gold pattern to diffuse into the bulk of the resonator. Upon cooling, the gold diffusion increases the stiffness of the resonating structure slightly, which reflects as an upward shift in resonance frequency. Thus, silicon resonators can be permanently trimmed to a desired frequency value by an electrical calibration step. As a proof of concept, an upward frequency shift of 240 kHz is demonstrated for a 40% mass loaded 100 MHz SiBAR after one hour of Joule heating with 30 mA of DC current.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805527","","Degradation;Electric resistance;Electrodes;Etching;Frequency;Protection;Q factor;Resistance heating;Silicon compounds;Temperature","acoustic resonators;bulk acoustic wave devices;cooling;diffusion;elemental semiconductors;micromechanical resonators;silicon","Joule heating;cooling;current 30 mA;diffusion;electrical calibration;electrical trimming;frequency 100 MHz;resonance frequency;resonating elements;silicon bulk acoustic resonator;stiffness;time 1 hour;upward frequency shift","","9","4","12","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of using the common material such as amorphous silicon, a polymer (P3HT/PCBM) which has excellent light absorption, was used in this study. Without using delicate and high-temperature thin-film process, the entire fabrication process was performed at room temperature. As a light beam was illuminated onto the polymer surface, electron-hole pairs was generated such that a non-uniform electric field was induced when an AC voltage was applied on the ODEP chip, thus generating an ODEP force. It can be used to manipulate particles for several functions such as concentration, transportation and separation of particles. The concentration of the polymer was found to play an important role on the magnitude of the ODEP force. Experimental data showed that polystyrene beads can be moved around using the developed chip. The maximum ODEP force was experimentally found to be around 35.2 pN.

This mechanism will be applied to pick up an atom or molecule under SFM mode, then emits them to TOF mass analyzer using field evaporation for analyzing its mass in TOF-MA mode. To switch the cantilever position at TOF-MA mode, the fabricated probe generated the 255 mum of maximum displacement at the end of cantilever at an actuation voltage of 180 V. The cantilever is attracted with the electrode according to the curved shape using electrostatically pull-in effect. The front edge of the cantilever was aligned in front of integrated extraction electrode for emitting chemical species. In SFM mode, the cantilever was also attracted to another electrode.

Hence, this investigation proposes a novel approach for integrating a micro temperature sensor and a heater in a stainless steel-based micro reformer, to minimize size and optimize performance.","","978-1-4244-4629-2","978-1-4244-4630-8","10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068552","MEMS;micro reformer;micro temperature sensor","Fabrication;Temperature sensors","microfabrication;microsensors;temperature sensors","heater;methanol conversion ratio;microchannel;microelectro-mechanical-systems;microtemperature sensor;stainless steel-based microreformer","","0","","7","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, scientists have' tried hard to identify new alternative energy sources. Fuel cells have potential as an indispensable source of electrical power. However, the mass production of fuel cells encounters various problems, which are yet to be solved, such as determining the fuel flow rate inside fuel cells. The product of the chemical reaction that proceeds in a fuel cell is water, which lowers the working efficiency of the cell and affects the fuel flow rate. No study of the fuel flow rate within a micro fuel cell has yet been published. Hence, in this work, micro flow sensors are fabricated on a flexible substrate as the gas diffusion layer (GDL) using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) within the micro fuel cell. The fundamental concept of the micro flow sensor is the use of two sets of micro temperature sensors plus and a set of heaters. The temperature difference between the two sensors is measured. The heater is also used to increase the working temperature of the fuel cell when the actual temperature is not favorable. The experimental results show an accuracy and sensitivity of the micro temperature sensor of 0.5 degC and 1.31 Omega/degC, respectively.","","978-1-4244-4629-2","978-1-4244-4630-8","10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068661","MEMS;flexible substrate;micro flow sensor;micro fuel cell","Chemical products;Chemical sensors;Fuel cells;Gas detectors;Mass production;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Sensor systems;Temperature sensors;Thermal sensors","flow sensors;fuel cells;microfabrication;microfluidics;microsensors;temperature sensors","chemical reaction;flexible substrate;gas diffusion layer;heaters;microelectromechanical systems;microflow sensor;microfuel cell;microtemperature sensors;resistance 1.31 ohm;temperature 0.5 degC;useable energy production","","0","","9","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fluidic and thermal behaviors are usually different from those of the macro devices. In this paper, the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the rarefied nitrogen gas flows in microchannels are investigated using DSMC method. In order to study the effects of the wall temperature (T<sub>w</sub>) on the mass flux and wall heat flux in the microchannels, the temperature of the incoming gas flow (T<sub>infin</sub>) is set constant at 300 K, and the wall temperature varies from 200 K to 800 K. For all of the simulated cases, majority of wall heat flux stays within the channel entrance region and drops to nearly zero when it reaches the middle region of the channel. When T<sub>w</sub> < T<sub>infin</sub>, with the restriction of the pressure driven condition and continuity of pressure, the number density of the flow has to decrease along the flow direction eventually after a short increase at the entrance region. When T<sub>w</sub> > T<sub>infin</sub>, the number density of the flow drops rapidly near the inlet, and the temperature of the gas flow increases. As the T<sub>w</sub> increases, the flow becomes more rarefied, the mass flux decreases, and the resistance at the entrance region increases. Furthermore, when T<sub>w</sub> > T<sub>infin</sub>, sudden jump in heat transfer flux and temperature are observed at the exit region of the channel.","","978-1-4244-4629-2","978-1-4244-4630-8","10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068668","DSMC;Heat flux;Mass flux;Micro-fluidics;Pressure boundary conditions","Birds;Fluid flow;Heat engines;Heat transfer;Microchannel;Microelectromechanical devices;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Temperature","Monte Carlo methods;heat transfer;microchannel flow","direct simulation Monte Carlo method;heat transfer;mass transfer;microchannel;microelectro-mechanical systems;microfluidic systems;nanoelectro-mechanical systems;rarefied nitrogen gas flows;temperature 200 K to 800 K","","0","","20","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the emerging applications of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and their increasing integration, presents a challenging requirement to embed ultra-low power digital control architectures for these lithographically formed micro-structures. Controlling electromechanical structures of such a small scale, using naive digital controllers, can be prohibitively expensive (both in power and cost for portable or battery operated applications.) In this paper, we describe the potential for control systems to be transformed into a set of co-operating parallel linear systems and demonstrate, for the first time, that this parallelization can reduce the total number of instructions executed, thereby reducing power, at the expense of controlled loss in control fidelity. Since the error tolerance of linear feedback control systems is mathematically well-posed, this technique opens up a new, independent dimension for system optimization. We present a novel computer-aided design (CAD) method to evaluate control fidelity, with varying timescales on the controller, and analyze the trade-off between performance and power dissipation. A CAD Metric for control fidelity is proposed and we demonstrate the potential for power savings using this decomposition on two different control problems.","1063-9667","978-0-7695-3506-7","","10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749707","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delay;Design automation;Digital control;Electromechanical sensors;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Micromechanical devices;Real time systems","digital control;electronic design automation;embedded systems;feedback;lithography;low-power electronics;optimisation","computer-aided design;control-loop bandwidth;embedded systems;error tolerance;linear feedback control systems;lithography;low-power requirements;micro electro-mechanical systems sensors;microstructures;multitimescale control;parallel linear systems;system optimization;ultra-low power digital control architectures","","0","","20","","","5-9 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study on the development of a microgripper utilizing relatively fast and accurate technique. A combination of Pseudo Rigid Body Modeling (PRBM) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technique is evident to expedite the prototyping procedure of the mechanism. The introduction of hybrid compliant mechanism concept via the unification of flexure hinge and cantilever beam structures provides significant improvement towards the microgripper grasping behavior to attain high precision and fidelity manipulations. The model was fabricated out of aluminum plate utilizing wire Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) technique. Empirical studies were conducted to investigate the performance of the mechanism as well as for model verification. The gripper demonstrates high motion amplification and maximum stroke of 100 mum can be achieved.","","978-1-4244-3506-7","978-1-4244-3507-4","10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939527","Microgripper;bias spring;flexure hinge;microassembly;micrograsping;piezoelectric actuator","Aluminum;Fasteners;Finite element methods;Grippers;Mechanical systems;Microassembly;Micromechanical devices;Prototypes;Robustness;Structural beams","beams (structures);cantilevers;electrical discharge machining;finite element analysis;grippers;manipulator dynamics;micromanipulators","MEMS technology;cantilever beam structures;finite element analysis technique;flexure based microgripper;microelectromechanical systems;micromanipulation;precision manipulation;pseudo rigid body modeling;wire electro discharge machining technique","","0","","23","","","10-13 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some control strategies are not adequately mature yet during the complex transient city cycle and are still needed to be optimized with the updating experiment data collected with day-to-day operation. Due to the speciality of fuel cell engine and electrified power-train system, some particular measurement, monitoring and calibration devices are ensuring normal operation of the fuel cell bus in the demonstration. The 3-axial accelerations of the fuel cell buses are the significant parameters to evaluate dynamical performance and manipulation stability. Furthermore they also feature the characteristic of city cycle route in demonstration.

In order to verify the validity of the model and the filter, static test, rate test and oscillating test are designed. The test results demonstrate that the performance of MEMS gyroscope is improved remarkably when the body does not move with great flexibility and the effectiveness will come down when the flexibility of the body increases. Analysis has been done to illustrate the reasons for the phenomena. So the technique should be used with caution when the body move with great flexibility.

To overcome these challenges, this research brings together the disciplines of electrical engineering (miniaturized radiocommunication devices) and physics (micro electro-mechanical systems MEMS) to create a combination of skills and know-how to produce new knowledge on complex interactions between CMOS and MEMS in RF receivers. These technologies are combined with the idea that for an extremely wideband signaling radio such as UWB, energy-efficient analog blocks should be maximally used. To implement these ideas, this research has three specific objectives: 1) MEMS resonators will be used to build a filtering interface for channel selection right at the antenna, 2) a low phase-noise 528-MHz MEMS frequency reference will be developed to feed novel fast-hopping clock-generation, and 3) analog baseband techniques such as a mixed-mode Viterbi decoder will be utilized for decoding the received signaling with minimized power dissipation.","","978-1-4244-2930-1","978-1-4244-2931-8","10.1109/ICUWB.2009.5288715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5288715","","Baseband;Bit rate;Clocks;Decoding;Electrical engineering;Micromechanical devices;Physics;Radio frequency;Synthesizers;Ultra wideband technology","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Viterbi decoding;channel coding;micromechanical resonators;ultra wideband communication;wireless channels","CMOS;DC power;MEMS resonator;RF receiver;UWB;analog baseband technique;antenna;channel selection;clock synthesizer design;electrical engineering;energy-efficient analog block;fast-hopping clock-generation;filtering interface;low phase-noise;microelectro-mechanical system;miniaturized radiocommunication device;mixed-mode Viterbi decoder;physics;power hungry baseband function;ultrawideband radio","","0","","25","","","9-11 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This switch is electro-statically actuated by the voltage generated by the micro piezoelectric system that has a low range as 0.6-1 V. Thus, an optimization is required to decide the size of the switch and the material to be used that are suitable for pull-in voltage range. In this optimization, a closed form model of pull-in voltage is used. The switch should work far away from resonant frequencies. Due to this constraint, a resonant frequency analysis must be investigated and it is required to decide which sizes and materials are convenient. Also, the system needs an ideal switch meaning that it should have a low resistance. What is more, we want the switch to have a hysteretic behavior meaning that pull-in and pull-out voltages should be different. As the system will work in a vibrating environment, not only electrical but also mechanical analyses like tip deflection analysis and response under instant accelerations play a big role to decide whether the switch pulls in below the required voltage, or not.","","978-1-4244-5106-7","978-9944-89-818-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355263","","Acceleration;Hysteresis;Immune system;Microswitches;Piezoelectric materials;Resonant frequency;Switched capacitor circuits;Switches;Vibrations;Voltage","electrostatic actuators;microswitches;piezoelectric devices","MEMS switch;electrostatic actuator;hysteretic behavior;instant accelerations;micro piezoelectric voltage generator system;micro-electro-mechanical switch;optimization;pull-in voltage;pull-out voltage;resonant frequency analysis;tip deflection analysis;vibrating environment","","0","","6","","","5-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are usually protected and supported by silicon oxide. Because the suspended structures are released from the silicon substrate in various etchants, the etch resistivity of the oxide layer is very important for suspended structure fabrication. In this paper, we improve the etch resistivity of low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) silicon oxide layers by using annealing process to substitute thermal oxide grown in a high-temperature and high-cleanness furnace. We prepared thermal oxide and CVD oxide samples and then measured the etch rates after tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) anisotropic etching process and dry etch process. According to the experiment data, we found that the etch rates of CVD oxide were slightly decreased in dry etch and obviously decreased in TMAH solution. The etch rates of 600°C annealed TEOS based oxide and 600 °C annealed SiH4 based oxide in 25 wt.% TMAH at 80°C are 1.1 and 0.7 Å/min respectively. The etch resistivity of CVD oxide can compete the etch resistivity of thermal oxide when annealing temperature is up to 600°C. The stress characteristics of annealed oxide layer were also measured in this paper. The stress has a minimum value at 600°C annealing temperature. In our work, a single crystalline silicon heater was successfully completed by using annealed CVD oxide as passivation layer. The heater with a resistance of 200 ohms glowed as bias current is up to 38 mA. We also simulated and characterized the temperature distribution of the microheater. The ANSYS simulation shows the central temperature of the microheater is 1135°C as the bias power is 0.59 W.","","978-1-4244-5528-7","","10.1109/NANOMED.2009.5559093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559093","Annealing process;CVD silicon oxide;MEMS;Microheater;TMAH","Annealing;Chemicals;Heating;Plasma measurements;Plasma temperature;Polymers;Temperature measurement","annealing;chemical vapour deposition;etching;heating;micromechanical devices;silicon;substrates","CVD oxide;MEMS devices;TMAH anisotropic etching process;TMAH solutions;annealing effect;annealing process;current 38 mA;dry etch process;etch rate;etch resistivity;low temperature chemical vapor deposition;low-temperature oxide;microelectromechanical system;microheater applications;power 0.59 W;resistance 200 ohm;silicon oxide layers;silicon substrate;stress characteristics;suspended structures;temperature 1135 degC;temperature 600 degC;tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide;thermal oxide","","1","","14","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A microgripper compliant mechanism is one of the key elements in micro-robotics and micro-assembly technologies for handling micro-objects without damage. Compliant mechanisms can play an important role in the design of micro-devices for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) applications. Compliant mechanisms are flexible structures, which can generate the desired motions by undergoing elastic deformation instead of through rigid linkage/joints as in rigid body mechanisms. The topology optimization methods search for an ideal material distribution of a structure.

The greatest advantage of micro injection molding is that it can massively produce micro-components rapidly with low-cost. Due to the poor flow capability of melting plastics into micro channel, and the additions of the engineering-plastics and fibers, it is difficult to inject the melted plastics into the cavities of the mold. In order to apply the microinjection technique in the fabrication of microfluidic chip, raising cavity surface temperature will be one of the solutions and reduce the cycle-time. High mold temperature not only improves the replication capacity of micro-structures but also effectively reduces molecular orientation. Therefore, developing systems for rapidly heating and cooling for injection of microfluidic chip is the main objective of this study. Numerical computations of eddy currents and heat conduction have been carried out by using the finite-element method (FEM). A simulation tool is also developed by integration of both thermal and electromagnetic analysis modules of ANSYS. Coil current, coil to plate distance and heating time are varied for both experiments and simulations. Several modifications, such as spacing in between coil turns, the distance of the workpiece and the coils, and dimensional parameters, are carried out. The capability and accuracy of simulations on the induction heating are verified from experiments, the simulated temperature distributions show reasonable agreement with measured results.

In this paper, a macromodeling method based on mode superposition is focused on a circular microplate subjected to distributed electrostatic force. During the construction of reduced- order model (ROM), the energy sample data are calculated by running finite-element simulations, and a nonlinear function fitting scheme is used to generate analytical functions of kinetic energy, electrostatic co-energy and strain energy in terms of mode coordinates, thus generalized motion equations can be obtained according to the Lagrange mechanics. Once the ROM has been generated, it can be reused to simulate the behaviors of the device with a series of electric driving signals. Comparing the results of ROM with the results calculated by 3-D finite element analysis, it shows that the ROM speeds up computational process without sacrificing the accuracy, and the ROM can describe some nonlinear effects such as large displacement, pull-in instability, stress stiffening, and resonant vibration.","","978-1-4244-3863-1","978-1-4244-3864-8","10.1109/ICEMI.2009.5274654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274654","electrostatic;micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS);mode superposition;reduced order model","Analytical models;Capacitive sensors;Electrostatic analysis;Finite element methods;Kinetic energy;Lagrangian functions;Microelectromechanical systems;Motion analysis;Nonlinear equations;Read only memory","diaphragms;electrostatic actuators;finite element analysis;mechanical stability;micromechanical devices;plates (structures);vibrations","3-D finite element analysis;Lagrange mechanics;analytical functions;circular microplate;displacement;distributed electrostatic force;electrostatic actuator;electrostatic co-energy;generalized motion equations;kinetic energy;macromodeling;micro-electro-mechanical system;mode superposition;multiple energy domains;nonlinear function fitting;pull-in instability;reduced-order model;resonant vibration;strain energy;stress stiffening;thin circular diaphragm","","0","","14","","","16-19 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capacitor-based sensors with a nanogap in the range of (20~100 nm) was produced using SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer, and the insulator layer was the media layer of the capacitor. When the nanogap size is smaller than the electro double layer thickness, the dependence of the nanogap capacitance on the ionic strength is insignificant. This is critical in using the capacitance change as an indicator of the existence of target molecules. Filling the nanogap with biomolecules resulted in the change of capacitance. A C-V analyzer was used to measure the electrical (capacitance) property of the sensor. DNA immobilization technique was also carried out to immobilize double stranded DNA on the sensor and this result was used to understand the effect of plasma modification of silicon surface.

These demands lead us to develop a downscaled desk-top manufacturing machine which reduces the size of a machine but offers to control multi-DOF motions rapidly and smoothly. In this paper, we first introduce the design concept of three DOFs desk-top reconfigurable machine and analyze both static and dynamic structure characteristics. The results show feasibility that the position and orientation of the machine tool can be controlled during the machining operation simultaneously. Then, the dynamic simulations and experimental results using a closed loop control with a position feedback are presented to demonstrate performance and feature of the system.

The main purpose of this study is to compare the performance of optimized and un-optimized micopump which have the same diffuser throat/inlet area (i.e. 16000 mum<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, an additional optimized design which has smaller diffuser inlet area was considered to validate and analyze the effect of diffuser inlet area to the micropump performance. The experimental results were validated by comparing with previous generation which had not been optimized the diffuser element. Specifically, the experimental results showed that, with similar diffuser element inlet area (i.e. 160000 mum<sup>2</sup>), with and without optimized micropumps yield maximum flow rates of 246.4 muL/min and 194.8 muL/min, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the back pressure in the optimized micropump is 6.9 kPa, while that in the un-optimized pump is 5.69 kPa. The effect of diffuser element throat/inlet area to pump flow rate and back pressure was investigated by comparing the experimental results of two optimized designs, one with 80 mum times 80 mum and the other with 127 mum times 127 mum cross-sectional area. The results indicated that, the design with larger inlet area gave higher flow rate. However, the rate of reduction in the maximum flow rate with increasing back-pressure increases at the higher inlet area design, which is due to the greater pressure dissipation/loss associated with a larger channel cross-sectional area.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-2788-8","978-1-4244-2789-5","10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5152267","","Bonding;Cities and towns;Costs;Fabrication;Glass;Mechanical engineering;Microfluidics;Micropumps;Optical polymers;Silicon","bonding processes;micromechanical devices;micropumps","back pressure;channel cross-sectional area;diffuser inlet area;diffuser polymethylmethacrylate peristaltic micropumps;micro-electro-mechanical-systems techniques;pump flow rate;solvent-assisted bonding process","","0","","11","","","12-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A klystron is one attractive choice for generation of THz radiation due to its operation mechanism, efficiency and robustness and because its structure is amenable to being scaled down in size to achieve higher frequency operation. Due to the decrease in size as the frequency is increased, there is a need for the electron beam current density to increase in order to achieve reasonable output powers. The pseudospark (PS) discharge is an ideal electron beam source because it can produce a high current density and small diameter (<1 mm) electron beam. A 200 GHz microklystron was designed and simulated using the particle-in-cell (PIC) code MAGIC. Simulation results have revealed a strong amplification signal at this frequency. Based on previous experimental investigations on PS discharges, small-scale single gap PS experiments have recently been conducted resulting in the production of a 1 mm diameter, 4 A, 6 kV electron beam. The experiments show the possibility to further scale down the PS into the sub-mm range to drive a microklystron. The fabrication of the microklystron will be achieved by using a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process.","0730-9244","978-1-4244-2617-1","","10.1109/PLASMA.2009.5227421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227421","","Current density;Electron beams;Fault location;Frequency;Klystrons;Medical diagnostic imaging;Plasma diagnostics;Power generation;Production;Robustness","klystrons;micromechanical devices;plasma devices;plasma simulation;sparks","current 4 A;electron beam;frequency 200 GHz;microelectromechanical systems;microklystron;particle-in-cell code MAGIC;pseudospark electron beam;size 1 mm","","0","","4","","","1-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second International Conference on","20091016","2009","2","","176","179","At present, with the rapid development of Micro-electromechanical Systems(MEMS), micro devices are favored because of their low-cost and excellent performance. The research on the flow and heat transfer has become more and more active in micro motor and micro bearing often met in MEMS. For the micro-scale flow in MEMS, on the one hand, it is difficult to carry through thermal measure and physical experiment for the small frame size. On the other hand, the programs of Burnett Equation and Direct simulation of Monte Carlo (DSMC)approach are trivial and large with high calculating cost. The flow region with higher Knudsen(Kn) number does not belong to continuum flow region, and it can not be solved directly by using N-S Equation. Aiming at micro-scale Couette flow system, the corresponding theoretical model has been built on the basis of improved N-S Equation, Fourier's law and ideal gas law. Generalized molecule mean free path, generalized dynamic viscosity and generalized heat conductivity are introduced in the new model so it can be used to simulate the flow in the slipping and transition region. Then a new kind of numerical simulation method named the Generalized Differential Quadrature(GDQ) is mainly explored. Applying GDQ method, the numerical simulation of flow field is made. And using DSMC approach, the new model is verified. The solutions show that the simulation results of the new model are basically consistent with the DSMC's. The remarkable merits of GDQ method consist in its simple program, low calculation cost and large engineering application value. But the error is becoming more and more large with the increase of Kn number. So it is necessary to improve the new model in the later research to simulate the gas flow in the larger domain.","","978-0-7695-3804-4","","10.1109/ICICTA.2009.280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5288200","Couette flow;direct simulation of Monte Carlo approach;generalized differential quadrature method;micro electro-mechanical system","Costs;Equations;Fluid flow measurement;Heat transfer;Micromechanical devices;Micromotors;Monte Carlo methods;Numerical simulation;Size measurement;Viscosity","Couette flow;Knudsen flow;Monte Carlo methods;Navier-Stokes equations;flow simulation;heat conduction;microfluidics;slip flow","Fourier law;Knudsen number;MEMS;N-S Equation;direct simulation of Monte Carlo approach;flow field simulation;generalized differential quadrature method;generalized dynamic viscosity;generalized heat conductivity;generalized molecule mean free path;ideal gas law;microscale Couette flow system;numerical simulation method;slipping flow;transition flow","","0","","8","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The contribution of current injection from trap assisted tunneling and Poole-Frenkel effect is investigated. The experimental results indicate that the charging arises from the formation of a defect band where charge transport occurs through a Poole-Frenkel like effect. The calculated activation energy shows direct relation to material stoichiometry hence the nitride band gap.

The assembly of micro-devices involves handling of parts that are extremely very small. This paper presents the design of compliant grip and move manipulators with parallel movement tips. The integration of both gripping and moving manipulators with parallel movement tips is accomplished by the use of compliant mechanisms, which generate paths that are symmetric. The structural topology optimization approach is applied in order to find the optimal material distribution in the proposed domain for compliant mechanism. A 2-D finite element analysis (FEA) model using ANSYS is constructed for the propose design domain. The optimal configurations of the compliant mechanism, which can realize a micro grip and move with parallel movement tips, is demonstrated.","1944-9399","978-1-4244-4832-6","978-981-08-3694-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394582","MEMS;compliance;compliant mechanism;parallel movement;topology optimization","Aerospace electronics;Assembly;Computer aided manufacturing;Finite element methods;Information technology;Micromechanical devices;Nanoelectromechanical systems;National security;Topology;Transportation","finite element analysis;grippers;manipulator dynamics;micromanipulators;nanoelectromechanical devices","2-D finite element analysis;ANSYS;compliant grip manipulators;compliant move manipulators;microelectromechanical systems;microgrip;nanoelectromechanical systems;nanogrip;optimal material distribution;parallel movement tips;structural topology optimization","","0","","13","","","26-30 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
