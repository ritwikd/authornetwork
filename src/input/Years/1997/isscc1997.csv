This architecture is an attractive solution for high-resolution ADCs, as extremely linear circuit topologies are not required. To increase the resolution of folding and interpolating ADCs above the published 8 b examples, without raising the number of parallel input stages or the number of comparators in the fine-comparator, a cascaded folding and interpolating architecture is introduced. The ADC achieves 64 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 75 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), while quantizing a 15 MHz full-scale input signal at 50 MSample/s.

Bell Laboratories management anticipated a rapid expansion of communications in the post-war era. However, they also saw several areas of major concern that would pose serious limitations on future telecommunications systems. Near the top of Mervin Kelly's list of limitations was the slow speed of the electro-mechanical relays and the high power dissipation and poor reliability of vacuum-tube amplifiers. Kelly, the Bell Labs Director of Research, established a group in the summer of 1945 to focus on understanding semiconductors. By January of 1946, the group was fully in place. Stanley Morgan and William Shockley were group leaders.

Instead, multiple cascaded stages must he used, with each stage a simple (noncascode) inverting or noninverting amplifier. In designing a multistage opamp with multiple feedback loops, special care must be taken to ensure stability. A well-known compensation technique is nested Miller compensation. The complexity of the transfer function of the NMC based multistage amplifiers is reflected on its stability conditions. This makes it difficult to devise a systematic design procedure that yields stable NMC-based amplifiers. A topology using nested transconductance (G/sub m/)-capacitance compensation (NGCC) has a simple transfer function that yields simple stability conditions. These conditions can be exploited to simplify design.

A CRC VCO is controlled by the absolute value of divided signal phase differences (AV-DSPD). Based on the AV-DSPD architecture, a 4.25GHz CRC is suitable for non return to zero (NRZ) data streams. Although the CRC consists of bipolar transistors, fabrication is in 0.251/spl mu/m BiCMOS allowing the CRC to be integrated with other digital blocks, such as a byte-lock detector, necessary for data link systems using the fiber-channel standard.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585374","","ANSI standards;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Communication standards;Computer architecture;Cyclic redundancy check;Data communication;Data mining;Frequency;Optical fiber communication","BiCMOS digital integrated circuits;clocks;data communication;optical communication equipment;optical fibre communication","0.25 micron;4.25 GHz;ANSI fiber-channel standard;AV-DSPD architecture;BiCMOS clock recovery circuit;NRZ data stream;VCO;byte-lock detector;clock signal;computer data links;digital blocks;divided signal phase differences;high-speed serial data communication systems;transmitted data stream","","4","2","3","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiplexers on the 2B level (l6:l) have a complexity that makes possible implementation in commercial technology. This gives a serial speed of 622 Mb/s at the framer-interface.

Target specifications are 7 b of linearity at 20 MSample/s with a signal bandwidth from DC to 10 MHz. Such a filter is applicable to 64-QAM digital modems over coaxial cable or twisted-pairs. The filter is implemented using switched currents. A single transconductor acts as the front-end interface circuit and converts an analog differential input voltage signal to a differential current. The signal current is sampled and held by class-AB current copier cells. The sampled current signals, unlike conventional CCD FIR filters, are held within the current copier cells and are not propagated through the taps. The robust digital coefficients are propagated, instead of the sensitive analog signals. Hence, the loss of signal fidelity is determined solely by leakage of the copier cells rather than the propagation loss. The filter, implemented in 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS, is fully-programmable and can be configured to perform lowpass or bandpass functions respectively.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585258","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Coaxial cables;Digital filters;Finite impulse response filter;Linearity;Modems;Propagation losses;Prototypes;Transconductors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;FIR filters;active filters;active filters5602157;band-pass filters;low-pass filters;operational amplifiers;programmable filters;sampled data filters;switched capacitor filters;switched current circuits;switched filters","0.8 micron;10 MHz;16-tap filter;64-QAM digital modems;CMOS IC;analog FIR filter;bandpass function;class-AB current copier cells;digitally programmable coefficients;lowpass function;sampled-data switched-current filter;transconductor","","9","","2","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though a 1.2 V 49 ns bulk-DRAM has been reported, still lower voltage operation is difficult for bulk-DRAMs, due to the back bias effect and large junction capacitance. SOI devices have several advantages over bulk devices, such as small subthreshold swing (S-factor), elimination of the back bias effect, and small junction capacitance. To utilize these advantages, many SOI-DRAM studies and proposals have been made. The basic operation of the SOI-DRAM at 2.3 V has been examined using an experimental 64 kb SOI-DRAM, and a 3 V 50 ns 16 Mb SOI-DRAM has been also reported. Here the authors present a 1 V 46 ns 16 Mb SOI-DRAM which uses a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS/SIMOX process. To accelerate low-voltage speed, a body-pulsed sense amplifier (BPS) and body-driven equalizer (BDEQ) are used. The conventional body-control technique uses partially-depleted (PD) transistors.

Digest of Technical Papers. 43rd ISSCC., 1997 IEEE International","20020806","1997","","","56","57","Companding improves dynamic range in situations with restricted signal swing, such as in low-voltage circuits, without the need to reduce noise at the cost of increased power dissipation. The log-domain filter principle achieves instantaneous signal companding by taking advantage of exponential device characteristics. Thanks to the high compression ratio, voltage swing and frequency tuning become almost independent of supply voltage, which can be reduced to the minimum required for proper operation. The combination of instantaneous companding with class AB operation permits processing of signals much larger than the bias level and hence increases dynamic range substantially. Class AB log-domain filters are suited to low-voltage and low power applications with moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and linearity requirements. The authors present a 3/sup rd/-order Chebyshev filter which is based on an integrator and implemented in a 1 /spl mu/m BiCMOS process. The filter can be tuned over more than 3 decades with cut-off frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 15 MHz at supply voltages between 0.9 V and 2 V. For a 1.2 V supply, cut-off frequencies up to about 1 MHz are achieved.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585259","","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Costs;Cutoff frequency;Dynamic range;Filters;Noise reduction;Power dissipation;Voltage","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;Chebyshev filters;active filters;circuit tuning;integrating circuits","0.9 to 2 V;1 micron;10 kHz to 15 MHz;52.5 dB;BiCMOS process;class AB operation;companding;dynamic range;integrator based design;log-domain filter;low power applications;low-voltage applications;third-order Chebyshev filter","","23","","4","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The parasitic capacitance of each line is over 60 pF on the video input side and over 150 pF at the vertical lines. The required signal amplitude at the vertical lines, which depends on the liquid crystal material, is always more than 3 V/sub pp/ for good black and white picture contrast. Conversely, a small signal amplitude is crucial to low power consumption and low electromagnetic radiation. Thus, a gain stage is needed to amplify the signals. For reasons of signal processing speed, the sample and hold (SH) stage precedes the gain stage. However, this configuration increases the offset pedestal originating from the SH stage at the gain stage.

Similar to channels using peak detection, the filter performs two tasks. First it band limits the signal spectrum to about 1/4 of the bit-rate. This rejects high-frequency noise, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second it equalizes pulse shape to achieve, in conjunction with an adaptive FIR, the target channel response (EPR4). A seventh order phase-equiripple response is used for linear phase response over a wider frequency range than a Bessel response. The filter cutoff frequency is programmable from 7 to 50 MHz for channel rates to 200 Mb/s and a servo information frequency as low as 5 MHz.

Built-in self-test (BIST) for a 1 Gb DRAM realizes a 200 Gb/s failed-search for repair with redundancy and reduces on-wafer function test time to less than 1/100 that of a bit-by-bit test. An array architecture, with very-long word (VLW) transfer circuits, probes DRAM internal nodes and transfers a 4 kb pass or fail bit-map. An on-wafer test management unit (TMU), includes a failed-address aligner (FAA) that converts a transferred 4 kb VLW into two streams of l0 b/spl times/l6 w(word) failed-address data. Major BIST functions are continuous test vector generation and failed-bit detection. Line test widely known as a failed-bit detection method, reduces the final test time. However, line-test circuits are not adequate to search and identify failed-bits in DRAM wafer test. In this on-wafer BIST, if failed-bits are detected, the failed-addresses are directly sent to an external tester, shortening failed-bit search time to within the same order as line-test time. The DRAM and two TMUs (UP and DN) concurrently operate on a wafer. The TMUs are on both sides of the DRAM, partitioned by scribe lines.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585265","","Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Circuit testing;Coupling circuits;FAA;Packaging;Probes;Random access memory;Read only memory;Wiring","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;built-in self test;integrated circuit testing;redundancy","0.16 micron;1 Gbit;200 Gbit/s;DRAM wafer test;Gb dynamic DRAM;VLW transfer circuits;array architecture;built-in self-test;continuous test vector generation;failed-address aligner;failed-bit detection;failed-bit search;giga-scale DRAM;on-wafer BIST;onwafer test management unit;redundancy;very-long word transfer circuits","","3","1","4","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IRAM is attractive because the gigabit DRAM chip has enough transistors for both a powerful processor and a memory big enough to contain whole programs and data sets. It contains 1024 memory blocks each 1kb wide. It needs more metal layers to accelerate the long lines of 600mm/sup 2/ chips. It may require faster transistors for the high-speed interface of synchronous DRAM. Potential advantages of IRAM include lower memory latency, higher memory bandwidth, lower system power, adjustable memory width and size, and less board space.

First, the supply voltage will go down from the present 5 V to 3 V and subsequently to 2 V, because the smaller dimensions result in a reduction of the breakdown voltage. Second, the circuit density possible increases. To meet the VLSI demands, compact topologies are needed that can operate on supply voltages between 1 and 2 V, depending on threshold voltages of the transistors. Existing CMOS opamps are compact but cannot operate at supply voltages below 2.5 V or otherwise have a complicated structure. The authors present a compact opamp which operates on supply voltage down to one gate-source voltage and two saturation voltages which amounts to 1.8 V. The opamp consists of two stages, an input stage and, a rail-to-rail output stage. An intermediate part contains current sources and a current mirror that sums the differential signals from the input stage and, cascodes that provide gain.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585413","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuits;Impedance;Mirrors;Operational amplifiers;Paper technology;Threshold voltage;Very large scale integration;Voltage control","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;VLSI;differential amplifiers;operational amplifiers","1.6 micron;1.8 V;CMOS operational amplifier cells;VLSI;compact topology;low supply voltage;low-power CMOS op amp;rail-to-rail output stage","","7","1","5","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Microprocessor clock frequencies are increasing faster than process technology performance improvement by reducing the number of gates between latches. This increases the ratio of flipflops or latches to logic gates, and together with the fact that approximately twice the number of logic gates are used with each new architecture, leads to significant increase in clock capacitive load and power. This trend also drives up the delay in distributing and buffering the clock around the microprocessor to more than 50% of the clock cycle.

This is extended to the quadrature, or complex, case if a complex filter - having complex-valued coefficients and thus not restricted to a symmetrical frequency response - is placed in a /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ loop. The modulator performs a ""complex"" A/D conversion on the pair of analog inputs, that are in phase-quadrature, and it has two high-speed bit stream outputs: one represents the real output; the other the imaginary output. When combined, these outputs form a complex signal that accurately represents the complex input within a narrow frequency band. This quadrature modulator is useful in architectures for a single-chip digital-radio receiver. The receiver ideally has no image response, and thus the bulky narrow-band image-rejection filter in the RF stage of a single-path receiver can be replaced with a broadband one. The architecture alleviates many problems of the direct-conversion receiver, often considered for single-chip implementations, since the input signal is mixed to a non-zero IF where 1/f noise and DC offsets cause no problem and self-interference is not an issue because oscillator frequency is offset from the carrier frequency.

Three solutions have been proposed: low-threshold devices, on-chip voltage multipliers, and switched-opamps. Technologies with low-threshold devices are costly. On-chip voltage multiplication is not possible in scaled-down technologies where devices cannot sustain the multiplied voltage. Switched opamps have the potential to solve the problem by eliminating critical switches in series with opamp output nodes and realizing their function by turning the opamp on and off.

A straight flash-architecture would need 1023 accurate fast comparators. With a 2 V input range, a comparator offset voltage of no more than 1 mV can be tolerated. Taking into account that the 1 mV is a 3-6 sigma value, leads to a large chip. If, however, the signals to the comparator are amplified before the critical decision, simple small comparators would suffice. To cope with the dynamic offset caused by the clocking and latch action of the comparator itself, the architecture must tolerate comparator offsets of up to 60-80 mV. Hence, a gain of at least 30 is necessary. A single amplifier however, could not handle this, as the input range of 2 V would be amplified to 60 V. The approach here is to use a distributed amplifier.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585304","","CMOS digital integrated circuits;Clocks;Distributed amplifiers;Impedance;Latches;Resistors;Strips;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;cascade networks;comparators (circuits)5602188;distributed amplifiers;interpolation","10 bit;170 mW;CMOS ADC;chip architecture;clocking;comparator;distributed amplifier;dynamic offset voltage;latching;sample rate","","6","2","2","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transceiver chipset for digital data transmission is realized on the 25 GHz bipolar Siemens B6HF process. The transmitter IC integrates the complete synthesizer including PLL, VCOs, frequency doubler, supply voltage regulation and supporting switching functions. Due to the open-loop architecture, the input impedance variation of the switched power amplifier results in frequency deviation of the VCO caused by load pulling. The required isolation can not be achieved within a single IC package. Previous solutions use an external discrete buffer stage. To increase the integration level, the buffer amplifier has been realized on the RX-IC. The advantage of this configuration is increased isolation due to the fully-differential setup. The chipset architecture is suitable for FSK digital mobile radio portable and base stations, especially cordless phone system from 1.6 GHz up to 2.5 GHz including DECT, wireless LAN, wireless local loop, 2.4 GHz ISM band frequency hopping system or any other system using FSK modulation.

This results in a reduction of the signal bandwidth and thus a large inter-symbol interference (ISI). This side effect is offset by detecting the partial response of the transmitted signal, in which the ISI is subtracted from the signal. The receiver samples the data at half-periods of the clock. It employs a delay-locked loop to time sampling at the end of each symbol period of length T, to fully exploit signal current integrated in the signaling line during that period.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585412","","Capacitors;Clocks;Delay;Driver circuits;Equations;Gas detectors;Intersymbol interference;Resistors;Sampling methods;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;comparators (circuits);delay circuits;driver circuits;intersymbol interference;partial response channels","delay-locked loop;driver power;driver power reduction;high speed memory-to-processor communications;inter-symbol interference;partial response detection technique;signal bandwidth;signal current;signaling scheme;transistor width","","11","15","2","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digitization of IF processing confers several important advantages, including greater reliability, potentially lower power consumption, and improved performance as technology scales. Unfortunately, as analog signal processing is eliminated and the A/D conversion is moved away from baseband, the signal that must be digitized has a larger dynamic range, and the converter must operate at a higher sampling rate. This work introduces a two-path, switched-capacitor architecture for a bandpass /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator that is suited to digitizing narrowband radio signals with large dynamic range. A fourth-order bandpass modulator is implemented in a standard 0.6 /spl mu/m, single-poly, triple-metal CMOS process.

While MOSFET amplifiers have extremely small bias currents, they exhibit much larger offset voltages and low-frequency noise than their BJT counterparts. A high-performance opamp in a 1 /spl mu/m 5 V digital CMOS technology achieves high DC gain, as well as excellent PSRR and CMRR and is capable of driving a 100 /spl Omega/, 1 nF load. It uses a mixed-mode (analog/digital) compensation loop to reduce input offset to <50 /spl mu/V. The loop uses digital offset extraction and storage circuitry, and has an analog current-mode output. Offset cancellation can be performed at power-up or upon request. Unlike existing commercially available low-offset high-precision amplifiers, the opamp needs only a single 5 V low-voltage supply, requires no trimming, and uses no BJTs or JFETs.

In conventional CMOS design, the body (or bulk) of the transistor is connected to the appropriate supply rail. In DGMOS, the potential of the body is determined by its operating state. This allows transistors to have a much higher drain current when turned on (effective low V/sub th/) and much lower leakage current when turned off (effective high V/sub th/) compared with the conventional fixed back gate bias configuration.

Traditional domino circuits shown are especially sensitive because skew must be budgeted in both half-cycles. The problem with such domino pipelines is that evaluation starts when the clock connected to the first gate in the half-cycle rises but the output needs to be valid before the clock on the output latch falls. In the worst case, the evaluate clock is late and the latch clock is early, decreasing time for logic. Many designers realize that some of the overhead can be reduced by using differential domino (also called dual rail) designs. An SR latch or pipeline latch at the end of dual-rail circuits lessens sensitivity to the falling edge. Self-timed techniques eliminate clocks and clock skew, but raise new issues of control overhead, timing assumption verification, and testability. The methodology reported here boosts operating frequency by tolerating clock skew, eliminating latches from the critical path, and better balancing logic between phases of the pipeline.","0193-6530","0-7803-3721-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585468","","Circuits;Clocks;Latches;Logic;Pipelines;Rails;Semiconductor device measurement;Size measurement;Strontium;Time measurement","adders;delays;fault tolerant computing;integrated logic circuits","domino pipelines;skew-tolerant domino circuits","","7","2","4","","","8-8 Feb. 1997","06 Feb 1997-08 Feb 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the number of passive filters, recent highly integrated transceiver ICs tend to use single-conversion superhet architecture. The majority of the system gain in those transceivers are realized either at the IF frequency or at baseband. The baseband approach has the advantage of lower power consumption. A high gain IF amplifier, on the other hand, prevents offset and flicker noise from significantly degrading the signal. This IF amplifier is programmable from -20 dB to 60 dB in 2 dB steps. The amplifier is part of a CMOS RF transceiver IC. One of the challenges for this design is high gain at relatively high frequency, with associated stability problems. For the GSM handset, low power is a strong requirement. CMOS implementation involves additional design considerations. To minimize power consumption, the IF amplifier is realized as a chain of three amplifiers of the same configuration, so each amplifier's unity gain bandwidth is limited to around 700 MHz.

It incorporates a plurality of differential pairs (DP) coupled in parallel, forming a transadmittance stage. The input of each DP is provided with the input signal voltage, shifted by an offset voltage. The offset voltage of each individual DP is variable and independent of other DP offsets. When all offset voltages are equal, the transadmittance stage is set to maximum gain. The linear input region is then comparable to that of a single DP transadmittance stage. When the offset voltages are made equidistant at about 40 to 60 mV, the transadmittance stage is set to minimum gain. The linear input range is then increased compared to the situation of maximum gain and is dependent on the number of DPs. Gain settings between minimum and maximum gain are achieved by values of equidistance of the offset voltages between 0 and 40 to 60 mV. A prototype variable gain amplifier is in a 1 /spl mu/m triple metal bipolar process. It contains 32 parallel DPs and has a differential voltage input as well as output. The gain range is 0 to 25 dB.

Dusty or smoking surroundings are also places where ultrasound is used for presence detection instead of light. In applications where detection must take place in a small enclosure, such as counting drops of medicine in a drip, a miniaturized sensor is desirable. In such applications a fully-integrated ultrasound microsystem in a IC-compatible technology has an advantage in both size and cost. This fully-integrated IC, is configurable either as a transmitter or as a receiver, to bind two micromachined ultrasound membranes into a general purpose barrier-detecting microsystem. Miniaturized microsystems today are usually designed to take full advantage of the rapid progress of both the integrated sensor and integrated circuit technologies. A trend in such systems is to integrate sensors, in this case the ultrasound transducer, using the same technology as the integrated circuits. The advantage of realizing sensors and circuits on the same chip is to tap the strong manufacturing base of the IC technologies perfected in low-cost mass production. The ultrasound transducer with which this circuit forms a microsystem is a silicon membrane that can be micromachined out of a BiCMOS technology using one simple post-processing step.

This raises questions such as how well digital CMOS circuits can co-exist on the same substrate as the radio front-end, or whether there is sufficient on-chip isolation in a low-cost package to guarantee stable operation of a receiver with more than 100 dB of baseband gain, or how the power amplifier modulates the on-chip local oscillator. The future of CMOS transceivers may well depend on satisfactory answers to these questions.

A high spectral purity voltage-controlled oscillator is known to be the crucial component in achieving an all-CMOS RF transceiver. Full-scale integration of complete transceivers often does not include the VCOs. One of the problems in achieving a good quality VCO is in obtaining a high quality varactor. Gray has formulated that phase noise is inversely proportional to the power dissipation and quality factor product term of the varactor (ISSCC, pp. 45-46, 1997). This paper reports a thin-film SOI gated varactor based on a gated pin diode structure which achieves a nominal capacitance of 7 pF with a sensitivity of 5 pF/V through the anode-cathode voltage. A third terminal (gate) provides additional tuning flexibility and offers 1 pF/V sensitivity. S-parameter measurements reveal a Q of 14. The process is conducted without any modification to an industrial SOI CMOS process. The nominal capacitance can be varied with different gate bias.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723096","","Capacitance;Phase noise;Power dissipation;Q factor;Radio frequency;Transceivers;Transistors;Varactors;Voltage;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;capacitance;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit modelling;silicon-on-insulator;transceivers;varactors;voltage-controlled oscillators","7 pF;RF ICs;S-parameter measurements;SOI CMOS process;Si-SiO/sub 2/;TFSOI gate varactor;VCO quality;VCOs;all-CMOS RF transceiver;anode-cathode voltage;capacitance;full-scale transceiver integration;gate bias;gate tuning flexibility;gated pin diode structure;high-Q SOI gate varactor;phase noise;sensitivity;spectral purity;thin-film SOI gated varactor;varactor power dissipation-quality factor product;varactor quality;voltage-controlled oscillator","","3","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key component of such a PON system is the burst-mode transmitter inside the optical network unit (ONCS) at the subscriber end. It must have low power consumption since it must run from a backup battery during power outages, low cost to be competitive with regard to the copper-based infrastructure, and stable over a wide temperature range because it may be located outdoors.
