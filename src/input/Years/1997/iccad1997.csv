Given the input statistics, the conditional entropy per bit is estimated by means of a sigmoidal model. A polynomial approximation to the entropy of the sign bits has been developed. Entropy and switching activity of primary inputs are used to estimate the output activity. The Triple-Bit Type (TBT) model is introduced to describe the behavior of the LSBs of the multiplier output, which do not behave as white noise. The error between the results of the proposed models and the measurements of entropy and switching activity is about 1% for signals with correlation factor less than 0.8.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743077","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Energy consumption;Entropy;Microelectronics;Permission;Power dissipation;Probability;Statistics;White noise","entropy;logic CAD;power consumption;signal processing;switching circuits","LSBs;Triple-Bit Type model;accurate calculation;bit level switching activity;bit level transition activity;conditional entropy;correlation factor;data path operators;dual bit type model;entropy based calculation;entropy function;input statistics;multiplier output;polynomial approximation;sigmoidal model;sign bits;switching activity;word level statistics","","2","","9","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simple disjunctive decomposition is a basic and useful concept, that extracts a single output subblock function whose input variable set is disjunctive from the other part. The paper presents a method for finding simple disjunctive decompositions by generating irredundant sum-of-products forms and applying factorization. We prove that all simple disjunctive decompositions can be extracted in our method, namely all possible decompositions are included in the factored logic networks. Experimental results show that our method can efficiently extract all the simple disjunctive decompositions of the large scale functions. Our result clarifies the relationship between the functional decomposition method and the two-level logic factorization method.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742859","","Binary decision diagrams;Logic","logic CAD;minimisation of switching nets","compact logic networks;disjunctive decompositions;factored logic networks;factorization;functional decomposition method;input variable set;irredundant sum-of-products forms;large scale functions;simple disjunctive decompositions;single output subblock function;two-level logic factorization method","","1","","12","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yuan et al., 1997). Unfortunately, RDCs, being a global property, are often much more difficult to compute than the satisfying set of typical CTL formulas. We address this problem through the use of Approximate Reachability Don't Cares (ARDCs), computed with the algorithms developed for the VERITAS sequential synthesis package (H. ho et al., 1990; 1996). Approximate reachable states represent an upper bound on the set of true reachable states, and thus a lower bound on the set of unreachable (Don't Care) states. ARDCs can be 10X to 100X (or much more for very large circuits) cheaper to compute than RDCs, and in some cases have the same dramatic effect on CTL model checking as the real RDCs. We also discuss the application of ARDCs to the problem of exact computation of the RDCs themselves. Experiments on industrial benchmarks show that order of magnitude speedups are possible, and occur frequently. The experimental results presented strongly support our claim that ARDCs play a safe and important way out of a serious dilemma: RDCs are necessary for tractable model checking of many large circuits, but the computation of the RDCs themselves is often intractable. We include, and theoretically justify, significant extensions of the VERITAS algorithms, and show that they can be up to an order of magnitude faster, while computing a virtually identical upper bound.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742896","","Boolean functions;Circuits;Costs;Data structures;Latches;Reachability analysis;Robustness;State-space methods;Upper bound","computational complexity;formal verification;reachability analysis","ARDCs;Approximate reachable states;CTL model checking;RDCs;Reachability;VERITAS algorithms;VERITAS sequential synthesis package;exact computation;global property;tractable model checking;virtually identical upper bound","","6","","18","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model reduction procedure is based on a multipoint rational approximation algorithm formed by orthogonal projection of the original time varying linear system into an approximate Krylov subspace. The models obtained from the approximate Krylov subspace projector can be obtained much more easily than the exact projectors but show negligible difference in accuracy.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742857","","Context modeling;Electrical capacitance tomography;Filters;Linear approximation;Linear systems;Permission;RF signals;Radio frequency;Reduced order systems;Time varying systems","circuit CAD;differential equations;linear systems;reduced order systems;time-varying systems","approximate Krylov subspace;approximate multipoint Krylov subspace projectors;automated extraction;filters;mixers;model reduction;model reduction procedure;multipoint rational approximation algorithm;near linear signal path;nonlinear RF blocks;nonlinear time varying components;orthogonal projection;reduced models;system level simulation;time varying differential algebraic equations;time varying linear system;time varying linear systems;transistor level nonlinear simulation","","18","4","31","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavioral descriptions of these applications may contain a large number of array references for data accesses. Dependencies between array accesses cause bottlenecks in the derivation of high performance schedules. We introduce a scheduling integrated technique to identify and remove these bottlenecks. We first demonstrate that there is a significant loss in the quality of a scheduler if these bottlenecks are not taken into account by the scheduler. We then propose a technique to overcome these bottlenecks by introducing new operations in the schedule called verification operations. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that a scheduler. powered by our technique demonstrates a two fold improvement in performance (measured in terms of the average number of clock cycles) over a recently introduced scheduler for control flow intensive behavioral descriptions, called Wavesched. Wavesched itself has a two fold performance advantage over traditional methods such as path based scheduling and loop directed scheduling. Also, the best- and worst-case execution times for the enhanced schedules obtained by our method are usually equal to or much less than the corresponding values for the execution times obtained by previous schedulers.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743066","","Access protocols;Clocks;Data analysis;High level synthesis;Image processing;Memory management;Neck;Permission;Signal processing;Testing","high level synthesis;scheduling;storage management","Wavesched;array references;clock cycles;control flow intensive behavioral descriptions;control-flow intensive behavioral description scheduling;data accesses;execution times;high performance schedules;loop directed scheduling;memory access bottlenecks;path based scheduling;scheduling integrated technique;verification operations","","1","1","16","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, processes cannot be reused in a new system without tailoring the code to deal with the new system's control information. The modal process framework provides a high-level way to specify the coherence of replicated control information independently of the behavior of the processes. Thus multiple processes can be composed without internal tailoring and without suffering from errors common in lower-level specification styles. This paper first describes a kernel-language representation for the high-level composition operators; it also presents a synthesis algorithm for the mode manager, the runtime code that maintains control information coherence within and between distributed processors.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742849","","Coherence;Communication system control;Computer science;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Design engineering;Design methodology;Embedded system;Permission;Runtime","embedded systems;systems analysis","distributed processors;embedded systems;high-level composition;kernel-language representation;modal process framework;modal processes;mode manager;replicated control information;runtime code","","3","2","8","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This, in part, is a result of logic synthesis not optimizing across register boundaries. We focus on precomputation as a resynthesis technique capable of resynthesizing across register boundaries. By using precomputation, a critical signal is computed earlier in time, thus allowing it to be combinationally optimized with logic from previous pipeline stages. Precomputation automatically discovers some standard circuit transformations like bypassing and lookahead. In addition, precomputation can be used in conjunction with combinational logic synthesis to resynthesize a circuit to obtain better performance. The paper contributes to the understanding and development of precomputation. First, it provides a synthesis algorithm for precomputation. Second, it demonstrates how precomputation can be used to improve sequential logic resynthesis and reports the results of applying a heuristic to a subset of the MCNC benchmarks. Third, it illustrates how precomputation generalizes and unifies bypassing and lookahead-two important and practical architectural transformations often used in processor design and high level synthesis of DSP processors. Finally, it clarifies the relationships among precomputation, retiming, and implicit retiming.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742891","","Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Delay;High level synthesis;Logic circuits;Logic design;Pipelines;Process design;Registers;Signal synthesis","combinational circuits;heuristic programming;high level synthesis;sequential circuits","DSP processors;architecture resynthesis;combinational logic synthesis;implicit retiming;logic resynthesis;pipeline stages;precomputation;register boundaries;sequential logic resynthesis;standard circuit transformations;synthesis algorithm","","4","","11","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such problems include placement, routing, scheduling and partitioning. A commonly used technique for solving these problems is to model them as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, and to then solve the resulting model using a generic ILP solver. So far, improving the computational efficiency of these problems was considered equivalent to improving the model. We show that large performance improvements can be achieved by incorporating problem specific information into the ILP solver itself. While the techniques that we present are general in nature, for the sake of concreteness, we illustrate them by applying them to scheduling problems in high level synthesis. It is shown that there is a lot of problem specific information that can be incorporated into the model solver, and that doing so actually improves the performance considerably. We present experimental results to show that the problem specific ILP solver is considerably faster, often showing improvements by a factor of 1000 in execution time.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743068","","Computational efficiency;Integral equations;Linear programming;Problem-solving;Processor scheduling;Testing","VLSI;high level synthesis;integer programming;scheduling","ILP based problems;ILP solver;VLSI design;computational efficiency;computational performance;execution time;generic ILP solver;high level synthesis;integer linear programming;performance improvements;problem specific ILP solver;problem specific information;scheduling problems","","2","","9","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our objective is to find the shape function of a wire which minimizes delay. This problem has been studied recently under the Elmore delay model (W.C. Elmore, 1948). However, it is well known that Elmore delay is only a rough estimate of the actual delay and thus more accurate models should be used to determine the wire shape function. Our study uses the transmission line model which gives a very accurate estimation of the actual delay. Since previous studies under Elmore delay model suggest that exponential wire shape is effective for delay minimization, we restrict the wire shape function to be of the form f(x)=ae/sup -bx/. By solving the diffusion equation, we derive the transient response in the time domain as a function of a and b for both step and ramp input. The coefficients a and b are then determined so that the actual delay (50% delay) is minimized. Our algorithm is very efficient; in all the experiments we performed, the wire shape functions can be determined in less than 1 second.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743079","","Delay effects;Delay estimation;Delay lines;Equations;Integrated circuit interconnections;Permission;Shape;Transmission lines;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;delays;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;transient analysis;transient response;transmission line theory","Elmore delay model;VLSI wire;continuous wire sizing optimization;delay minimization;diffusion equation;non uniform wires;shape function;time domain;transient response;transmission line model;wire shape function","","5","","15","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These assumptions can be derived from the information known a priori about the delay of the environment and the timing characteristics of the gates that will implement the circuit. The paper presents necessary conditions to synthesize circuits with a correct behavior under the given timing assumptions.

On the other hand, it has been unknown, whether division, the operation inverse to multiplication can be efficiently represented by some type of word-level DDs. We show that the representational power of any word-level DD is too weak to efficiently represent integer division. Thus, neither a clever choice of the variable ordering, the decomposition type or the edge weights, can lead to a polynomial DD size for division. For the proof we introduce word-level linear combination diagrams (WLCDs), a DD, which may be viewed as a ""generic"" word-level DD. We derive an exponential lower bound on the WLCD representation size for integer dividers and show how this bound transfers to all other word-level DDs.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743094","","Adders;Boolean functions;Circuits;Computer science;Data structures;Logic;Permission;Polynomials","decision diagrams;formal verification;integrated circuit design;logic CAD","BMD;HDD;PHDD;WLCD;decision diagrams;decomposition type;division;edge weights;exponential lower bound;floating point multipliers;integer division;integer multipliers;integrated circuit verification;multiplication;variable ordering;word-level decision diagrams;word-level linear combination diagrams","","2","","17","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Noise can also have adverse power, timing and reliability effects. Dynamic logic is particularly susceptible to charge-sharing and coupling noise. Thus, the design and optimization of a circuit should take noise considerations into account. Such considerations are typically stated as semi-infinite constraints. In addition, the number of signals to be checked and the number of sub-intervals of time during which the checking must be performed can potentially be very large. Thus, the practical incorporation of noise constraints during circuit optimization is a hitherto unsolved problem. This paper describes a novel method for incorporating noise considerations during automatic circuit optimization. Semi-infinite constraints representing noise considerations are first converted to ordinary equality constraints involving time integrals, which are readily computed in the context of circuit optimization based on time-domain simulation. Next, the gradients of these integrals are computed by the adjoint method. By using an augmented Lagrangian optimization merit function, the adjoint method is applied to compute all the necessary gradients required for optimization in a single adjoint analysis, no matter how many noise measurements are considered, and irrespective of the dimensionality of the problem. Numerical results are presented.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742876","","Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Coupling circuits;Design optimization;Digital circuits;Logic;Optimization methods;Switches;Switching circuits;Timing","circuit noise;circuit optimisation;circuit reliability;circuit simulation;digital circuits;electric noise measurement;time-domain analysis;timing","adjoint method;augmented Lagrangian optimization merit function;automatic circuit optimization;charge-coupling noise;charge-sharing noise;circuit design;circuit noise;digital circuits;dimensionality;dynamic logic;equality constraints;gradients;incorrect switching;noise constraints;noise measurements;numerical results;power effects;reliability effects;semi-infinite constraints;signal checking;time integrals;time sub-intervals;time-domain simulation;timing effects","","17","1","16","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some heterogeneous FPGAs do not have limitations on the availability of LUTs of specific sizes within chip capacity due to the configuration flexibility of their PLBs, while others, such as Altera FLEX10K devices and Vantis VF1 FPGAs, have limited number of LUTs of certain types (such as embedded memory blocks), which we call heterogeneous FPGAs with bounded resources. LUTs of different sizes usually have different delays. In this paper, we study the technology mapping problem for delay minimization for heterogeneous FPGAs with bounded resources. We show that it is NP-Hard for general networks, but can be solved optimally in pseudo-polynomial time for trees. We then present two heuristic algorithms, named BinaryHM and CN-HM, for delay minimization of general networks for heterogeneous FPGA designs with bounded resources. We have tested BinaryHM and CN-HM on MONO benchmarks on Altera FLEX10K device family, which can be taken as the heterogeneous FPGAs with 4-LUTs and a limited number of 11-LUTs. The experimental results show that compared with FlowMap using only 4-LUTs, both BinaryHM and CN-HM can reduce more than 20% of the circuit mapping delays, 27% of the 4-LUT area and 10% of the circuit layout delays by making efficient use of the available heterogeneous LUTs.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742848","","Algorithm design and analysis;Availability;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Heuristic algorithms;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Minimization methods;Programmable logic arrays;Table lookup","field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;minimisation of switching nets","FPGAs;NP-Hard;bounded resources;delay minimization;heterogeneous FPGAs;technology mapping problem","","4","","14","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first present a theory and numerical methods for nonlinear perturbation and noise analysis of oscillators described by a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), which extends our recent results on perturbation analysis of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In developing the above theory, we rely on novel results we establish for linear periodically time varying (LPTV) systems: Floquet theory for DAEs. We then use this nonlinear perturbation analysis to derive the stochastic characterization, including the resulting oscillator spectrum, of phase noise in oscillators due to colored (e.g., 1/f noise), as opposed to white noise sources. The case of white noise sources has already been treated by us in a recent publication (A. Demir et al., 1998).

We present a novel technique, FCLIP, that integrates folding into the generation of optimal layouts of CMOS cells in the two dimensional (2D) style. FCLIP is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and precisely formulates cell width minimization as a 0-1 optimization problem. Folding is incorporated into the 0-1 ILP model by variables that represent the degrees of freedom that folding introduces into cell layout. FCLIP yields optimal results for three reasons: (1) it implicitly explores all possible transistor placements; (2) it considers all diffusion sharing possibilities among folded transistors; and (3) when paired P and N transistors have unequal numbers of legs, it considers all their relative positions. FCLIP is shown to be practical for relatively large circuits with up to 30 transistors, We then extend FCLIP to accommodate-and-stack clustering, a requirement in most practical designs due to its benefits to circuit performance. This reduces run times dramatically, making FCLIP viable for much larger circuits. It also demonstrates the versatility of FCLIP's ILP based approach in easily accommodating additional design constraints.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742862","","Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Integer linear programming;Leg;Minimization;Permission;Rivers;Semiconductor device modeling","circuit layout CAD;integer programming;transistors","0-1 ILP model;0-1 optimization problem;CMOS cells;FCLIP;accommodate-and-stack clustering;cell width minimization;circuit performance;diffusion sharing possibilities;folded transistors;high performance cell layout;integer linear programming;integrated transistor folding;large circuits;optimal 2D cell layout;optimal layouts;relative positions;transistor placements","","2","6","16","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Midas synthesizes an architecture whose data storage and transfer subsystems are spatially integrated with its execution unit. Midas also generates a high level floorplan for the architecture, which contains the shapes and coordinates of its components and routing channel specifications for its buses.

The paper examines the problem of mapping a high level specification to an arbitrary architecture that uses specific, common bus protocols for interprocessor communication. The communication model presented allows for easy retargeting to different bus topologies, protocols, and illustrates that global considerations are required to achieve a correct implementation.

Two circuits from the suite of analog and mixed-signal benchmark circuits are used to validate our approach.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742900","","Analog circuits;Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Costs;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Observability;System testing","analogue circuits;automatic test pattern generation;circuit testing;fault diagnosis;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","analog benchmark circuits;analog circuits;analog systems;catastrophic failure detection;efficient test generation techniques;fast test generation techniques;fault coverage;fault detectability;mixed-signal benchmark circuits;multi-frequency ATPG;multi-frequency test generation technique;testability analysis;testability transfer factors","","4","","11","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A measurement error on a gate is defined to quantify the discrepancy resulting from replacing the size required by a synthesis sizing algorithm with a size available in a discrete cell library. The criterion for gate size selection is a set of gate sizes that minimizes the cumulative error of a prescribed measurement. Optimal solutions to the gate size selection problem targetting size and delay measurements are presented for cases when the probability distribution and the delay equations are simple. A realistic probability distribution is obtained using a sample space of gates derived from a group of designs that is synthesized under the semi-custom synthesis methodology (K. Shepard et al., 1997). A ""delay match"" (minimizing delay error) and a ""size match"" (minimizing size error) set of gate sizes are obtained numerically and are subsequently realized as discrete cell libraries. The previous group of designs are synthesized using the two selected cell libraries and two other cell libraries, one with ""equal spacing"" of cell sizes and the other with ""exponential spacing"" of cell sizes. The ""size match"" library gives the best overall slack and area results.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743051","","Area measurement;Delay;Extraterrestrial measurements;Measurement errors;Measurement standards;Paper technology;Permission;Size measurement;Software libraries;Standards development","logic CAD;logic gates;minimisation;probability","cumulative error;delay equations;delay measurements;discrepancy;discrete cell libraries;discrete cell library;exponential spacing;gate size selection;gate size selection problem;measurement error;minimizing delay error;minimizing size error;optimal solutions;primitive gates;probability distribution;realistic probability distribution;sample space;semi-custom synthesis methodology;size match;standard cell libraries;synthesis sizing algorithm","","19","","7","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major drawback of the pattern matching is that there is a case where a cell needs a lot of patterns representing its logic function. That is because patterns are decomposed into 2-AND/NOT patterns to match against decomposed subject graphs. Furthermore, the conventional technology mapper does not pay much attention to relations among patterns. Each pattern is tried to match independently. A novel pattern matching algorithm that does not require patterns to be decomposed and couple speeding up techniques utilizing inter-relations among cells are described. These methods are very effective for large cell libraries with complex cells.

We call such false paths waiting false paths, which correspond to multi cycle operations controlled by wait states. The allowable delay time of waiting false paths is greater than the clock period. When the number of allowable clock cycles for each path is determined, the delay of the path can be the product of the clock period and the allowable cycles. The paper presents a method to analyze allowable cycles and to detect waiting false paths based on symbolic traversal of FSM. We have applied our method to 30 ISCAS89 FSM benchmarks and found that 22 circuits include such paths. 11 circuits among them include such paths which are critical paths, where the delay is measured as the number of gates on the path. Information on such paths can be used in the logic synthesis to reduce the number of gates and in the layout synthesis to reduce the size of gates.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742902","","Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;Optimization;Performance analysis;Registers;Sequential circuits;Timing","finite state machines;high level synthesis;logic arrays;sequential circuits","FSM;ISCAS89 FSM benchmarks;allowable clock cycles;allowable delay time;clock period;critical paths;layout synthesis;logic synthesis;multi cycle operations;performance optimization;sequential logic circuits;symbolic traversal;wait states;waiting false path analysis","","1","1","8","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The buffer selection is in turn performed by using a continuous buffer sizing technique based on a very accurate delay model especially developed for submicron CMOS processes. The fanout trees can distribute a signal with arbitrary polarity from the root of the tree to a set of sinks with arbitrary required time, required minimum signal slope, polarity and capacitive load. These trees can be constructed to maximize the required time at the root or to minimize the total buffer area under a required time constraint at the root. The performance of the algorithm shows several improvements with respect to conventional fanout optimization methods. More precisely, the area and delay improvements are 28% and 7%, respectively, when the algorithm is applied to entire circuits.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743052","","Algorithm design and analysis;CMOS digital integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Circuit topology;Delay;Design optimization;Digital circuits;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS logic circuits;dynamic programming;logic CAD;minimisation;transistor circuits;trees (mathematics)","arbitrary required time;bipolar LT-trees;buffer area;buffer selection;capacitive load;continuous buffer sizing technique;delay improvements;delay model;digital circuit design;dynamic programming algorithm;fanout optimization algorithm;fanout trees;minimum signal slope;optimal fanout tree;submicron CMOS processes;submicron CMOS technologies;submicron transistor-level delay model;time constraint","","3","","9","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that the proposed XOR/XNOR based reencoding technique explores a sufficiently rich set of encodings to identify implementations with smaller cycle times. The Boolean and structural interpretations of reencoding are explored and its relationship to isomorphic sequentially redundant faults is presented. We also show that the reencoded circuit always has a valid initial state and present a simple procedure to derive it. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is illustrated on a large set of benchmark circuits which indicates an average cycle time improvement of 15.26% for a small area overhead of 3.56% over that of performance driven combinational logic optimization.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742890","","Appropriate technology;Automata;Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Encoding;Iterative methods;Logic;Minimization methods;Registers","combinational circuits;encoding;finite state machines;logic CAD","Boolean cube representation;XOR/XNOR based reencoding technique;benchmark circuits;combinational logic optimization;cycle-time minimization;fixed encoding length;gate netlists;isomorphic sequentially redundant faults;multilevel implementations;recursive learning techniques;resynthesis algorithms;structural interpretations;synchronous finite state machines;technology independent synchronous network representations;technology independent synchronous networks","","0","1","23","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A testability grading technique is utilized to measure the relative testability improvement in a design, as the result of making a subset of the variables fully controllable and observable. The variables that cause the greatest testability improvement are selected and the selection process is performed incrementally until no further testability improvement can be achieved. Then the registers that correspond to the selected variables are placed in the scan chain for partial scan implementation. The experimental results show that the variable selection approach produces partial scan implementations that can achieve high fault coverage, while the logic overheads are fairly low.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742854","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Costs;Flip-flops;Input variables;Logic;Permission;Registers","CAD;controllability;design for testability;logic testing;observability","controllability;digital system testability;high fault coverage;high level variable selection;logic overheads;observability measures;partial scan approach;partial scan implementation;relative testability improvement;scan chain;selection process;testability grading technique;testability improvement","","2","","11","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposal advances the state of the art because it is the first such verification procedure that is both complete and practical. Hardware verification is known to be a hard problem and the proposed verification technique leverages off the fact that high level synthesis-performed manually or by means of high level synthesis software-proceeds from the algorithmic description of the design to structural RTL through a sequence of very well defined steps, each limited in its scope. The major contribution is the partitioning of the equivalence checking task into two simpler subtasks, verifying the validity of register sharing, and verifying correct synthesis of the RTL interconnect and control. While state space traversal is unavoidable for verifying validity of the register sharing, we automatically abstract out irrelevant portions of the design, significantly simplifying the task that must be performed by a back end model checker. The second task of verifying the RTL is not only shown to reduce to a combinational equivalence check, we present a novel and fast RTL technique for combinational equivalence check instead of using slower gate level techniques. The verification procedure has been applied to several large circuits, and is illustrated on the implementation of a sort algorithm.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=743011","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Context modeling;Hardware;High level synthesis;Logic;National electric code;Permission;Proposals;Registers","computational complexity;equivalence classes;formal verification;high level synthesis","RTL interconnect;RTL verification;algorithmic description;back end model checker;combinational equivalence check;correct synthesis;equivalence checking task;fast RTL technique;hard problem;hardware verification;high level synthesis environment;high level synthesis flow;high level synthesis software;register sharing;register transfer logic;scheduled behavior;sort algorithm;state space traversal;verification procedure","","12","7","11","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although it is possible to reconfigure some FPGAs while an embedded system is operational, this feature is seldom exploited. Recent improvements in the flexibility and reconfiguration speed of FPGAs have made it practical to reconfigure them dynamically, reducing the amount of hardware required in an embedded system. We have developed a system, called CORDS, which synthesizes multi-rate, real-time, periodic distributed embedded systems containing dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs. Executing different tasks on the same FPGA requires that potentially time-consuming reconfiguration be carried out between tasks. CORDS uses a novel preemptive, dynamic priority, multi-rate scheduling algorithm to deal with this problem. To the best of our knowledge, dynamically reconfigured FPGAs have not previously been used in hardware-software co-synthesis of embedded systems. Experimental results indicate that using dynamically reconfigured FPGAs in distributed real-time embedded systems has the potential to reduce their price and allow the synthesis of architectures which meet system specifications that would otherwise be infeasible.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742851","","Costs;Electronics packaging;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Permission;Processor scheduling;Production;Real time systems","distributed processing;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;reconfigurable architectures;scheduling;software engineering","CORDS;FPGA;dynamic priority;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software co-synthesis;multi-rate scheduling algorithm;multi-rate system;periodic distributed embedded systems;price;real-time distributed embedded systems;reconfigurable systems;system specifications","","17","1","15","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm computes a superset of the set of states that lie on a path from the initial state to a state that violates a specified invariant property. If this set is empty, there is no possibility of violating the invariant. If this set is non-empty, it may be possible to prove the existence of such a path by searching for a counter-example. A simple heuristic is given, which seems to work well in practice, for generating a counter-example path from this approximation.

Together with a formula that estimates the worst case width of channels for a given global routing, a solution space of simultaneous placement and routing is realized. It is proved that the space contains an optimal solution within the framework of the model. To search the space for a better solution, simulated annealing is implemented.

We have developed a set of tools, transparent to both the design and debugging process, which enables the user to run long test sequences in emulation, and upon error detection, roll-back to an arbitrary instance in execution time, and switch over to simulation based debugging for full design visibility and controllability. The efficacy of the approach is dependent on the method for transferring the computation from one execution domain to another.

We present a general and comprehensive approach to extract functional regularity for datapath circuits from their behavioral or structural HDL descriptions. The fundamental step is the generation of a large set of templates, where a template is a subcircuit with multiple instances in the circuit. Two novel template generation algorithms are presented-one for templates with a tree structure, and the other for a special class of multi output templates, called single principal output (single-PO) templates, where all outputs of a template are in the transitive fanin of a particular output. The set of templates generated is complete under a few simplifying, yet practical, assumptions. This is key to obtaining a desirable cover of the circuit using templates. We show that excellent covers are obtained for various circuits, including ISCAS benchmarks. We also demonstrate that the regularity extracted for these circuits can be used to understand their underlying structure. We have successfully used our approach to identify bit slices of very large datapath circuits from general purpose microprocessors.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742893","","Arithmetic;Circuit synthesis;Design automation;Hardware design languages;Integrated circuit layout;Logic gates;Microprocessors;Permission;Productivity;Tree data structures","application specific integrated circuits;circuit layout CAD;hardware description languages;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD","ISCAS benchmarks;bit slices;datapath circuits;functional regularity;general purpose microprocessors;high performance custom IC designs;large datapath circuits;multi output templates;novel template generation algorithms;regularity extraction;single principal output templates;structural HDL descriptions;subcircuit;transitive fanin;tree structure","","11","4","13","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The starting point of this methodology is a declarative analytical description of the circuit. An equation manipulation program based on constraint satisfaction converts this declarative model into an efficient design plan for optimization based sizing. The efficiency is due to the use of an operating point driven DC formulation, so that the design plan avoids the calculation of simultaneous sets of nonlinear equations. From the same declarative analytical description also a direct symbolic yield estimation plan is generated. The parametric yield is estimated by propagating the spread of the technological variables through the analytical model towards the performance variables of the circuit. The design plan and the yield estimation plan are then combined together in the inner loop of a global optimization routine. The strength of this methodology lies in the low CPU times needed to perform yield estimation compared to the hours of simulation batches with Monte Carlo simulations, while the accuracy is comparable.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742889","","Analog circuits;Analytical models;Central Processing Unit;Circuit synthesis;Constraint optimization;Design methodology;Design optimization;Nonlinear equations;Robustness;Yield estimation","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;circuit CAD;constraint theory;statistical analysis","CPU times;Monte Carlo simulations;analog circuit synthesis;constraint satisfaction;declarative analytical description;direct symbolic yield estimation plan;equation manipulation program;global optimization routine;operating point driven DC formulation;optimization based sizing;parametric yield;performance variables;simulation batches;simultaneous yield/robustness optimization;technological variables;yield estimation plan","","20","2","9","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little progress has been made to identify and overcome the weakness of the direct (alternatively called flat) approach. We make the first observation that the performance of iterative improvement based flat multiway partitioner K-FM (L.A. Sanchis, 1989; 1993) is not suitable for today's large scale circuits. Then, we propose a simple yet effective hill climbing method called PM (Pairwise cell Movement) that overcomes the limitation of K-FM and provides partitioners the capability to explore wider range of solution space effectively while ensuring convergence to satisfying suboptimal solutions. The main idea is to reduce the multiway partitioning problem to sets of concurrent bipartitioning problems. Starting with an initial multiway partition of the netlist, we apply 2-way FM (C. Fiduccia and R. Mattheyses, 1982) to pairs of blocks so as to improve the quality of overall multiway partitioning solution. The pairing of blocks is based on the gain of the last pass, and the Pairwise cell Movement (PM) passes continue until no further gain can be obtained. We observe that PM passes are effective in distributing clusters evenly into multiple blocks to minimize the connections across the multiway cutlines. Our iterative improvement based flat multiway partitioner K-PM/LR improves K-FM by a surprising average margin of up to 86.2% and outperforms its counterpart recursive FIM by up to 17.3% when tested on MCNC and large scale ISPD98 benchmark circuits (C.J.

We propose a novel scheme for synthesizing nonlinear feedback shift register structures that can be superimposed on the boundary scan cells of ICs to generate MCM interconnect switching activities that resemble real life interconnect switching profiles. The goal is to perform at speed MCM interconnect test while simultaneously capturing the dynamic switching effects referred to earlier as accurately as possible during interconnect BIST. A library of nonlinear feedback shift register structures called Precharacterized Test Pattern Generators (P-TPG) is constructed. Components of P-TPGs are interconnected together in specific ways to recreate the switching activity profile of the interconnections being tested. An optimization algorithm for matching the P-TPG component activity profiles with those of the interconnections under test has been designed, and implemented experimental results confirm the validity of our approach.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742852","","Built-in self-test;Clocks;Crosstalk;Design methodology;Feedback;Hardware;Packaging;Shift registers;Testing;Voltage","automatic test pattern generation;boundary scan testing;built-in self test;integrated circuit interconnections;multichip modules","BIST hardware synthesis;MCM interconnect switching activities;MCM interconnect test;MCM interconnections;P-TPG;Precharacterized Test Pattern Generators;boundary scan cells;clock speeds;crosstalk;design methods;dynamic switching effects;ground bounce;interconnect BIST;nonlinear feedback shift register structures;optimization algorithm;performance testing;real life interconnect switching profiles;switching activity profile;switching noise","","2","","16","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increased flexibility that they offer is obtained by allowing both a node to change as well as its immediate fanins. The challenge with SPFDs is: (1) to compute them in an efficient way, and (2) to use their increased flexibility in a controlled way to optimize a circuit. We provide a complete implementation of SPFDs using BDDs and apply it to the optimization of Boolean networks. Two scenarios are presented, one which trades literals for wires and the other rewires the network by replacing one fanin at a node by a new fanin.

A discrete channel model for noisy digital logic in deep submicron technology that captures the manifestation of circuit noise is presented. The lower bounds are derived via an information-theoretic approach whereby a VLSI architecture implemented in a certain technology is viewed as a channel with information transfer capacity C (in bits/sec). A computing application is shown to require a minimum information transfer rate R (also in bits/sec). Lower bounds are obtained by employing the information theoretic constraint C>R. This constraint ensures reliability of computation though in an asymptotic sense. Lower bounds on transition activity at the output of noisy logic gates are also obtained using this constraint. Past work (for noiseless bus coding) is shown to fall out as a special case. In addition, lower bounds on energy dissipation is computed by solving an optimization problem where the objective function is the energy subject to the constraint of C>R. A surprising result is that in a scenario where capacitive component of power dissipation dominates: the voltage for minimum energy is greater than the minimum voltage for reliable operation. For an off-chip I/O signaling example, we show that the lower bounds are a factor of 24/spl times/ below present day systems and that a very simple Hamming code can reduce the energy consumption by a factor of 3/spl times/. This indicates the potential of noise tolerance in achieving low energy operation in the presence of noise.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742877","","Circuit noise;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Constraint theory;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Logic circuits;Reliability theory;Very large scale integration;Voltage","circuit noise;information theory;logic CAD;logic gates","VLSI architecture;asymptotic sense;capacitive component;circuit noise;computing application;deep submicron noise;deep submicron technology;discrete channel model;energy consumption;energy dissipation;energy efficiency;information theoretic constraint;information transfer capacity;information-theoretic approach;minimum energy;minimum information transfer rate;minimum voltage;noise tolerance;noiseless bus coding;noisy digital gates;noisy digital logic;noisy logic gates;objective function;off-chip I/O signaling example;optimization problem;power dissipation;reliable operation;simple Hamming code;transition activity","","11","","30","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By modeling RC impulses as time-shifted incomplete gamma distribution function, the delays could be obtained via table lookup using a gamma integral table and the first three moments of the impulse response. However, while this approximation works well for many examples, it struggles with responses when the metal resistance becomes dominant, and produces results with impractical time shift values In this paper the probability interpretation is extended to the circuit homogeneous response, without requiring the time shift parameter. The gamma distribution is used to characterize the normalized homogeneous portion of the step response. For a generalized RC interconnect model (RC tree or mesh), the stability of the homogeneous-gamma distribution model is guaranteed. It is demonstrated that when a table model is carefully constructed, the h-gamma approximation provides for excellent improvement over the Elmore delay in terms of accuracy, with very little additional cost in terms of CPU time.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742811","","Circuit stability;Costs;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit technology;Permission;Table lookup;Timing","RC circuits;circuit analysis computing;gamma distribution;table lookup;transient response","Elmore delay;RC delay metric;RC impulses;RC interconnect model;RC timing estimation;gamma distribution;gamma distribution approximation;homogeneous response;table lookup","","20","","16","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common practice of retrofitting linear noise concepts often leads to wrong answers. For a proper understanding of RF noise, nonlinearities and synchronization, i.e. phase noise in oscillators, have to be accounted for correctly, using stochastic processes. In this tutorial, we outline how to do so for non-oscillatory and oscillatory RF systems. We emphasize basic concepts and important results, while providing sufficient details to maintain rigour. Our presentation covers: basic stochastic concepts for noise analysis; nonstationarity, cyclostationarity and frequency correlation of noise; mixing noise in driven (non-oscillatory) systems; phase noise in oscillators; and computational techniques. Our goal is to enable designers and CAD engineers to understand the basic flow of RF noise analysis and the current literature.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742873","","Design automation;Design engineering;Frequency synchronization;Maintenance engineering;Oscillators;Phase noise;Radio frequency;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance;Stochastic systems","CAD;circuit noise;electrical engineering computing;phase noise;radiofrequency oscillators;stochastic processes;synchronisation","CAD;RF noise analysis;RF system noise estimation;computational techniques;cyclostationarity;driven systems;frequency correlation;linear noise concepts;noise analysis;noise mixing;noise performance prediction;nonlinearities;nonoscillatory RF systems;nonstationarity;oscillators;oscillatory RF systems;phase noise;retrofitting;stochastic processes;synchronization","","0","","","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, since the electrical characteristics of different layers in multilayer routing technologies vary widely, the assignment of the interconnect tree edges to specific routing layers has a large impact on the interconnect delays. Traditionally, critical global interconnect trees were routed greedily, one at a time. This caused the ""good"" layers to be used up largely for the first few trees, yielding poor routings for the remaining trees. Multiple passes with different tree orderings were usually used to remedy the situation, although with limited success. We propose the use of dynamically adjusted area quotas to prevent the first few trees from monopolizing the ""good"" layers. Our approach is independent of the routing model or the router employed, and reduces the maximum tree delays by around 15% as compared to traditional algorithms.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742861","","Computer science;Costs;Delay;Electric variables;Permission;Routing","circuit CAD;delays;interconnections;trees (mathematics)","DSM technologies;critical global interconnect trees;deep sub-micron;dynamically adjusted area quotas;electrical characteristics;interconnect delays;interconnect tree edges;maximum tree delays;multilayer routing technologies;multiple interconnect trees;multiple passes;performance driven layer assignment algorithm;routing layers;routing model;transistor delays;tree orderings","","1","1","9","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique, called TVP (Time-Varying Pade), is applicable to deterministic as well as noise analysis of many types of communication subsystems, such as mixers and switched capacitor filters, for which existing model reduction techniques cannot be used. TVP is therefore suitable for hierarchical verification of entire communication systems. We present practical applications in which TVP generates macromodels which are more than two orders of magnitude smaller but still replicate the input-output behaviour of the original systems accurately. The size reduction results in a speedup of more than 500.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742856","","Circuits;Communication switching;Communication systems;Computational modeling;Filters;Frequency;Noise reduction;Reduced order systems;Time varying systems;Transfer functions","CAD;circuit analysis computing;formal verification;reduced order systems;telecommunication computing;time-varying systems","TVP;Time-Varying Pade;communication subsystems;hierarchical verification;input-output behaviour;large systems;linear time varying systems;macromodels;mixers;model reduction techniques;noise analysis;numerical methods;reduced order modelling;size reduction;switched capacitor filters","","16","2","24","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent works by Cong et al. (1999) and Tang and Wong (2000) give algorithms to solve the buffer block planning problem. In this paper we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global nets given an existing buffer block plan. Assuming that global nets have been already decomposed into two-pin connections, we give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999). Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. Our model allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection. In addition, our algorithm observes buffer parity constraints, i.e., it will choose to use an inverter or a buffer (=co-located pair of inverters) according to source and destination signal parity. The algorithm outperforms previous approaches and has been validated on top-level layouts extracted from a recent high-end microprocessor design.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896458","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer graphics;Computer science;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;High performance computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Inverters;Repeaters;Silicon","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit interconnections","available buffer block plan;buffer parity constraints;global buffering;global interconnect;microprocessor design;top-level layouts","","12","1","25","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The TSMM technique performs moment matching (for expansion around s = 0) on a time-shifted version of the original signal. As compared to other well-known techniques (such as AWE by Pillage and Rohrer, 1990), TSMM offers distinct advantages. The 50% delay and rise time are determined with much more accuracy for a given approximation order. Moreover, the solutions have significantly improved accuracy as compared to AWE, especially for moderate to highly inductive signals. TSMM is able to achieve the approximation capability of PVL (Feldmann and Freund, 1995) and PRIMA (Odabasioglu et al., 1998) with much lower approximation order.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560196","","Circuit analysis computing;Continuous improvement;Delay effects;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;RLC circuits;Signal design;Signal processing;Timing;Very large scale integration","RLC circuits;VLSI;method of moments","AWE frequency range;PRIMA;PVL;TSMM technique;VLSI;delay time;rise time;time shifted moment matching;time shifting","","1","","10","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While Alder's one in can be shown to be, mathematically, more exact, the approximate method of Hajimiri and Lee is somewhat simpler, facilitating its use for purposes of analysis and design. In this paper, we show that, for stationary input noise sources, both methods produce equal results for the oscillator's phase noise behavior. However, when considering injection locking, it is shown that both methods yield different results, with the approximation of Hajimiri and Lee being unable to predict the locking behavior. In general, when the input signal causing the oscillator phase perturbations is non-stationary, the exact model produces the correct results while results obtained using the approximate model break down.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167539","","Circuit noise;Frequency;Injection-locked oscillators;Integral equations;Mutual coupling;Phase noise;Predictive models","circuit noise;injection locked oscillators;network analysis;phase noise;radiofrequency oscillators","analysis methods;approximate method;injection locking;oscillator phase behavior analysis;phase noise behavior","","21","2","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory of Otten (1998) is extended to show how one can model the blocks into a simple delay estimation technique that applies both to two-pin and to multi-pin nets. Even though the formula uses one buffer type, it shows remarkable accuracy in predicting delay when compared to an optimal realizable buffer insertion solution. Potential applications include wire planning, timing analysis during floorplanning or global routing. Our experiments show that our approach accurately predicts delay when compared to constructing a realizable buffer insertion with multiple buffer types.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382667","","Accuracy;Chip scale packaging;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Delay lines;Libraries;Resource management;Signal design;Timing;Wire","buffer circuits;delays;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;network routing","buffer insertion solution;buffered interconnect delay approximation;delay estimation technique;floorplanning;global buffer delay;global routing;multipin nets;timing analysis;two-pin nets;wire planning","","8","","16","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
