There are three general design requirements when integrating DRAMs and processors onto a single chip: high-data-rate random access, low-power dissipation, and efficiently synchronized DRAM and processor. The PIP-RAM employs three circuit techniques in response to these requirements: (1) a paged-segmentation accessing (PSA), (2) a clocked low-voltage-swing differential-charge-transfer (CLD), and (3) a multiphase synchronization DRAM control (MSD) that uses a multiple-stage PLL. Large memory capacity and high-data-rate random access achieved by these techniques make the PIP-RAM suitable for image processing of large-scale, full-color pictures.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488722","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Filters;Phase locked loops;Power dissipation;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Solid state circuits;Timing","DRAM chips;digital signal processing chips;image processing;image processing equipment;parallel architectures","1 W;16 Mbit;3.84 GB/s;7.68 GIPS;PIP-RAM;circuit techniques;clocked low-voltage-swing differential-charge-transfer;color pictures;multiphase synchronization DRAM control;multiple-stage PLL;paged-segmentation accessing;parallel image processing random access memory;power dissipation;processor elements;single chip","","17","23","3","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Improvements in MTCMOS device technology promise to lead to higher operating frequencies. However, higher frequencies will increase power consumption even if the supply voltage is 1 V. To reduce the power consumption, it is necessary to lower the supply voltage below 1 V, without sacrificing speed. A circuit consisting of depletion-mode MOSFETs operates with 200 mV supply. However, it cannot be applied to an LSI with more than 1 k gates because active-mode leakage current is too large. In addition, the circuit needs backgate bias, which is much larger than the supply voltage, to increase the threshold voltage and to reduce the leakage current in the sleep mode. To generate the large back-gate bias, multiple supply voltages or a boost circuit are required. The proposed low supply-voltage MTCMOS circuit with SIMOX technology uses enhancement-mode MOSFFTs and contains no boost circuit. High-speed operation of this SIMOX-MTCMOS circuit at 0.5 V supply is obtained by use of low-Vth CMOS logic gates consisting of fully-depleted body-floating MOSFETs.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488524","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Energy consumption;Frequency;Leakage current;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Logic gates;MOSFETs;Voltage","CMOS logic circuits;SIMOX;large scale integration;threshold logic","0.5 V;200 ps;LSI;SIMOX technology;SIMOX-MTCMOS circuit;Si;battery-operated portable equipment;enhancement-mode MOSFFTs;fully-depleted body-floating MOSFETs.;high-speed operation;low supply-voltage MTCMOS circuit;low threshold voltage;low-Vth CMOS logic gates;multi-threshold CMOS;power consumption reduction","","27","13","4","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The receiver is based on a subsampling architecture and operates in the 800-900 MHz range. It is a potential candidate for use in applications such as portable mobile data systems, personal communications devices, and cordless telephony. This receiver differs from a superheterodyne architecture in that the mixer is replaced by a sampling circuit and the intermediate frequency filters are replaced by a cascade of downsampling stages employing discrete-time filtering. The process of subsampling, sampling the input signal at a rate lower than the highest frequency components of the input signal, performs a function equivalent to mixing. Because the input is bandlimited by an analog RF filter, the Nyquist criterion is satisfied as long as the sampling rate is more than twice the bandwidth of this filter. The noise filter following the low noise amplifier (LNA) limits the noise bandwidth to prevent wideband noise from aliasing into the signal band and increasing the noise floor.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488511","","Bandwidth;Data systems;Filtering;Filters;Narrowband;Radio frequency;Receivers;Signal processing;Signal sampling;Telephony","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;UHF filters;UHF integrated circuits;biquadratic filters;cordless telephone systems;discrete time filters;land mobile radio;radio receivers;sample and hold circuits;signal sampling","800 to 900 MHz;Nyquist criterion;cordless telephony;discrete-time filtering;downsampling stages;integrated RF front-end;narrowband frequency-multiplexed channels;personal communications devices;portable mobile data systems;radio receiver architecture;sampling circuit;subsampling;subsampling architecture","","5","106","2","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional chopper stabilization techniques can have the adverse effect of aliasing the large amount of high-frequency quantization noise into baseband. One solution is to chop at integer multiples of the sampling frequency where the quantization noise spectrum is quiet. However, chopping at multiples of the sampling rate can increase the speed and power requirements on the amplifiers since it may be required to settle full output swings several times in each sampling interval. Alternatively, offset compensation has been used in /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators with the same offset and 1/f noise reduction effects as chopping, and with the additional benefit of opamp gain enhancement. Offset compensation effectiveness is limited by switch charge injection. Fully-differential circuit topologies help suppress errors caused by charge injection by rejecting common-mode charge injection but are still limited by switch mismatches. The author presents a /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator which uses offset compensation to suppress the amplifier offset and 1/f noise, and chopping of switches to average out mismatched charge injection effects. Chopping on the switches alone, unlike chopping the amplifier, does not substantially increase the demands on the amplifier, which is particularly important in high-speed, low-power applications.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488587","","Baseband;Choppers;Circuit topology;Frequency;Integrated circuit noise;Noise reduction;Power amplifiers;Quantization;Sampling methods;Switches","1/f noise;BiCMOS integrated circuits;circuit feedback;circuit stability;error compensation;integrated circuit noise;interference suppression;modulators;sigma-delta modulation;switched capacitor networks","/spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator IC;1/f noise reduction;4-channel modulator;SC sigma-delta modulation;amplifier offset suppression;chopped-offset stabilization;chopper stabilization;high DC precision applications;high-speed low-power applications;mismatched charge injection effects;offset compensation;offset drift;switched-capacitor type","","3","1","4","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently large systems, 64 processing nodes and above, can require multiple cabinets to house all their electronic equipment. This low-density packaging not only leads to expensive systems but also suffers from increased latency, skew, and other physical problems that limit overall performance. As thermal management schemes have progressed there is a growing trend to package more electronics into smaller physical volumes. The result is the integration of more processing nodes (PN) per integrated circuit, more PNs per printed circuit board (PCB), and more PCBs per shelf. This necessary hardware compression leads to an interconnect bottleneck at the backplane. One approach to overcome these interconnection limitations of electrical backplanes is to exploit the temporal and spatial bandwidth available with the free-space optical technology. A free-space optical backplane is composed of a large number of optically interconnected smart pixel arrays (SPAs). A smart pixel is an optoelectronic device that combines optical inputs and/or outputs with electronic processing circuitry, and is capable of being integrated into two-dimensional arrays. In an intelligent optical backplane, the SPAs control the flow of information between the PCBs.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488736","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Backplanes;Electronic packaging thermal management;Integrated circuit interconnections;Optical arrays;Optical devices;Optical interconnections;Packaging machines;Smart pixels;Thermal management","cooling;multiprocessing systems;optical interconnections;packaging","PCBs;free-space optical backplane;intelligent optical backplanes;optical interconnection;packaging;processing nodes;smart pixel arrays;teraflop multiprocessor computing systems;thermal management schemes;two-dimensional arrays","","0","","5","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A digital code that has negligible energy below 30 kHz is used, so that a combination of ac coupling and dc servo feedback prevents propagation of dc offsets in the IF chain. A class AB servo stage reduces the turn-on time of the receiver to 200 /spl mu/s, so it may be used in a time-division duplex (TDD) system. The typical phase accuracy of the I/Q output is one degree. The IC is designed for use in the 902-928 MHz industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) Band. It operates on a supply voltage of 2.7-5.0 V and draws 50 mA. It uses a 25 GHz f/sub T/ silicon-bipolar process.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488710","","Circuits;Low pass filters;Noise figure;Phase distortion;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Receivers;Servomechanisms;Spread spectrum communication;Voltage","cordless telephone systems;digital radio;land mobile radio;radio receivers;spread spectrum communication","900 MHz;AC coupling;DC feedback;IF chain;ISM band;channel selection;class AB servo stage;digital code;direct-conversion receiver;industrial-scientific-medical band;low-pass filter;radio design;silicon bipolar IC;spread-spectrum digital cordless telephone;time-division duplex system;zero intermediate-frequency","","9","2","4","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the probe card is intended for use with conventional digital testers, linear buffers can be integrated into the substrate to isolate the device under test (DUT) outputs from the 50/spl Omega/ transmission lines in the test system and drive those lines from matched impedances. Alternatively, by integrating the front-end circuits of a digital tester into the substrate, timing measurements can be made at distances less than 1cm from the probe tips, resulting in a significant improvement in testing accuracy.

Design techniques for 1.2 V CMOS switched-capacitor (SC) circuits are described. MOS transistors with low-threshold voltages are not required.

In moving-image processing for instance, this requires extraordinary computational powers of DSPs and MPUs, making real-time response of electronic systems unrealistic. Introduction of analog processing would lessen the difficulty, but cost must be traded off for accuracy. Analog/digital merged computation using /spl upsi/MOS circuits features the flexibility of analog processing but preserving the rigorousness of digital. Highly-parallel analog processing is performed for a large volume of analog input data, that is immediately followed by the binary decision of /spl upsi/MOS gates, resulting in the output of digital codes. Real-world data are directly compressed to digital codes without A/D conversion.

Conventional on-chip LPFs such as switched-capacitor filters and active-RC LPFs exhibit offset voltages of tens of millivolts depending on specific circuit architecture.

The folding architecture can be considered as a time-continuous two-step architecture. This means that a sample-and-hold amplifier is not necessary in this type of A/D converter. However, due to the folding operation, the internal frequency in the analog folding preprocessing will be a multiple of the input signal frequency. The result is a limited analog input signal frequency, less than full flash A/D converters achieve. This paper describes an A/D converter architecture in 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, incorporating a distributed track-and-hold (T/H) operation in the analog folding preprocessing, overcoming the previously-mentioned limitation, Maximum clock frequency is 80 MHz at a power dissipation of 80 mW from a 3.3 V supply voltage. The analog preprocessing reduces the requirements for the differential T/H amplifiers equal to the number of reference operations compared to a single T/H amplifier in front of the A/D converter.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488635","","CMOS technology;Circuits;Data preprocessing;Differential amplifiers;Frequency;Interpolation;Laboratories;MOS devices;Operational amplifiers;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;sample and hold circuits","0.5 micron;3.3 V;8 bit;80 MHz;80 mW;CMOS folding A/D converter;analog folding preprocessing;clock frequency;distributed T/H preprocessing;power dissipation;reference operations;time-continuous two-step architecture;track-and-hold operation","","18","1","5","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analog parallel array processor (APAP) chip is the core of the system. It contains a 20/spl times/20 matrix of computing cells, function-control circuits and interface circuits. The sensor provides the input signals for the APAP chip. The architecture ofthe 400 cells is based on a cellular neural network architecture. The cells have an internal-state node, an input node and an output. The output is the clipped version ofthe state. The cells send two current signals to their nearest neighbors and to itself: one proportional to the input and controlled by the feedforward weights or B-template; the second proportional to the output and controlled by the feedback weights or A-template. In every cell a constant bias source, controlled by the I-template, is also included. The templates are identical for all cells and are the instructions for the APAP. In this implementation the user can program the template weights over a continuous range of values from /spl plusmn/1/4 to /spl plusmn/4. All cells execute the instructions in parallel and in continuous time so that a parallel array processor is obtained with real-time signal processing capabilities.

In a progressive-scan CCD, the gate area for charge storage during vertical charge transfer decreases to less than half compared with a conventional CCD. The first objective is increased charge handling capability per unit gate area to compensate for the gate area decrease. The second is suppression of narrow and/or short-channel effect that is important in IT-CCD with channel area shrinkage. Two techniques overcome these problems. One is to avoid the decrease of effective channel width due to alignment error in stepper lithography that has a significant influence in a narrow-channel CCD. To this end, pixel design and processing are improved so one mask step for the buried channel determines channel width (regulated by three mask steps in a conventional CCD).

NRZ data such as used in Ethernet or Sonet, when transmitted over band-limited channels, suffer from dc wandering, where the received waveform is represented as a sum of individual symbol responses. The long tails of data symbols interfere with subsequent symbols, causing inter-symbol interference (ISI). The nonlinear decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is well known to remove post-cursor ISI without amplifying high-frequency noise. This paper reports an NRZ timing recovery technique working with a DFE that enables data transmission at a rate five times higher than the standard rate. Furthermore, a timing recovery technique using a data-triggered phase detector is reported to sustain phase locking to NRZ data even with more than 600 consecutive missing transitions.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488567","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Data communication;Decision feedback equalizers;Ethernet networks;Intersymbol interference;Optical signal processing;Phase detection;Probability distribution;Timing","data communication;decision feedback equalisers;intersymbol interference;telecommunication channels;timing circuits","DC wandering;Ethernet;NRZ timing recovery;Sonet;band limited channel;clock recovery;data recovery;data transmission;inter-symbol interference;nonlinear decision-feedback equalizer;phase detector;phase locking","","3","25","3","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes both a DLL and PLL design based upon self-biasing techniques in which all bias voltages and currents are referenced to other generated bias voltages and currents. Self biasing leads to a number of desirable properties that include IC process independence, fixed damping factor, fixed bandwidth-to-operating-frequency ratio, broad frequency range, input phase offset cancellation, and, most importantly, low input tracking jitter. Both damping factor and bandwidth-to-operating-frequency ratio are determined completely by a ratio of capacitors.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488539","","Clocks;Damping;Delay;Frequency;Integrated circuit noise;Noise generators;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Voltage;Working environment noise","delay circuits;digital integrated circuits;digital phase locked loops;jitter","DLL;PLL;bandwidth-to-operating-frequency ratio;capacitor ratio;clock generating blocks;damping factor;delay-locked loop;digital ICs;frequency range;high-speed I/O;phase offset;phase-locked loop;process independence;self-biasing;substrate noise;supply noise;tracking jitter","","31","12","4","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Graphics and video functions benefit from a tight integration with the CPU since partitioning of functions between hardware and software can differ from a traditional architecture without hurting performance.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488579","","Acceleration;Control systems;Graphics;Hardware;History;Joining processes;Pipelines;Random access memory;Registers;Software performance","microprocessor chips;multimedia computing","CPU;DRAM controller;L1 cache;PCI bus interface;accelerated graphics controller;graphics functions;integer pipeline;integrated modules;multimedia functionality;on-chip peripherals;video functions;x86 processor","","2","2","1","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major challenges for poly-Si TFT drivers in such multi-scan LCDs is displaying as black in the peripheral region around the picture during a blanking period. Using conventional shift register driver circuits, the scanning speed in the up-and-down no-picture region is too high for pixel TFTs to write signals for black. Although decoder driver circuits for multi-scan operation have been introduced into an HDTV poly-Si TFT-LCD, they require many address signals and logic gates. These increase circuit area and thereby decrease the manufacturing yields. Poly-Si TFT drivers use a combination of bi-directional shift registers and decoder circuits to solve the above problems for a 2.7 in, 1.3 Mpixel TFT LCD light valve.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488566","","Blanking;Computer displays;Decoding;Driver circuits;HDTV;Liquid crystal displays;Logic circuits;Logic gates;Shift registers;Thin film transistors","driver circuits;liquid crystal displays;multimedia systems;optical projectors;silicon;thin film transistors","1.3 Mpixel;2.7 in;SVGA;SXGA;Si;VGA;XGA;bi-directional shift registers;computer data;decoder circuits;driver circuits;light valve;multi-scan operation;multimedia projectors;poly-Si TFT-LCD;video-graphic arrays","","0","13","1","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A variable frequency enables a phase-locked loop (PLL) to servo the LO to a stable lower frequency reference, or to correct frequency errors from measurements on the received signal. A low phase noise ensures little interference with nearby channels. A large LO voltage-swing means that it can drive a mixer with greater linearity. Finally, in single-sideband applications, the LO must supply precise quadrature phases. Low phase noise mandates use of a high-Q resonator to tune the LO, although most RF resonators are usually not integrable on ICs. Quadrature outputs are usually derived from RC phase-shift of a single-phase LO output, but this is susceptible to component inaccuracy and loss in LO amplitude. The authors present a 900 MHz oscillator circuit implemented in 1 /spl mu/m CMOS that affords modestly low-phase noise, has variable frequency with large output swing, and provides quadrature-phase outputs from two identical coupled oscillators, connected in such a way that they exert a mutual squelch when their relative phase is not in quadrature.

Even though differential current mode logic (CML) with a differential voltage swing of less than 360 mV/sub pp/ is employed, a wiring capacitance of several 10 fF increases the power-delay product significantly. Wiring length is minimized by local biasing and omission of routing channels. The size of gates with two-level series gating (latch, and, xor) including emitter follower outputs is 67/spl times/58 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. The result of this local biasing scheme is a favourable positive temperature coefficient (TC) for the logic swing, partly compensating for the negative TC of the current switch gain at the cost of high sensitivity to supply variations. All transistors have 0.7 /spl mu/m minimum emitter length, the width avoids the high current region.
