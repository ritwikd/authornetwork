"Test front loading in early stages of automotive software development based on AUTOSAR","Michailidis, A.; Spieth, U.; Ringler, T.; Hedenetz, B.; Kowalewski, S.","Group Res. & Adv.

A method to handle the complexity of automotive software is Model Based Design (MBD). As MBD offers great advantages in early simulation and testing, it has become today's mainstream method for automotive software engineering. However, some aspects can be initially tested after the integration of software on real hardware components (usually by the supplier) and when all parts of a system (e.g. bus systems, sensors, actuators) are present. The consequence is that the requirement specification of the according system possibly contains gaps that can lead to software defects. New technologies like the AUTOSAR standard enable additional potentials for the validation of model based developed software. Due to the AUTOSAR software architecture it is possible for an OEM to realize an early ??virtual?? software integration with an acceptable effort and perform at next step a front loading of system tests. In this paper we present an approach that improves the quality of the requirement specification artifacts by using test front loading. In detail, we analyze the requirement engineering part of the software development process to identify aspects that can not be tested without having all system components. Afterwards, we classify these aspects and define an abstract test pattern that can be globally used for testing. Additionally, we illustrate our approach in a case study on an interior light system for the next Mercedes-Benz M-Class generation.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457166","AUTOSAR;front loading;model based design;validation and test;virtual integration","Actuators;Automotive engineering;Embedded software;Hardware;Programming;Sensor systems;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Vehicles","automobiles;embedded systems;open systems;program testing;program verification;software architecture;systems analysis;traffic engineering computing","AUTOSAR;automotive open system architecture;automotive software development;automotive software engineering;embedded software development;model based design;next Mercedes-Benz M-Class generation;requirement engineering;requirement specification artifact quality;software architecture;software defects;test front loading;vehicle system complexity;virtual software integration","","0","","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To assist with this analysis, we present a framework for performing joint exploration of both the architectural and circuit design spaces. In our approach, we use statistical inference techniques to create a model of a large micro-architectural design space from a small number of simulation samples. We then characterize the design tradeoffs of each of the underlying circuits and integrate these with the higher level architectural models to define the joint circuit-architecture design space. We use posynomial forms for all our models, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to efficiently search the joint design space. As an example, we apply this methodology to explore the power-performance tradeoffs in a dual-issue superscalar out-of-order processor, showing how the framework can be used to determine the optimal set of design parameters for energy efficiency. Compared to current architectural tools that use fixed circuit costs, joint optimization can reduce energy by up to 30% by considering circuit tradeoff characteristics.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457204","","Circuit analysis;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Design optimization;Digital systems;Energy efficiency;Microarchitecture;Out of order;Performance analysis;Space exploration","network synthesis;optimisation;statistical analysis","circuit design spaces;convex optimization tools;digital system;energy efficiency;fixed circuit costs;integrated framework;joint circuit-architecture design space;joint design space exploration;microarchitectural design space;statistical inference techniques","","1","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the network, we assume mesochronous synchronization implemented with hierarchical clock tree distribution. This paper contributes two essential components of any practical design automation support for network instantiation in the target system. On one hand, it introduces a switch design which greatly reduces the overhead for mesochronous synchronization and can be adapted to meet different layout constraints. On the other hand, the paper illustrates a design space exploration framework of mesochronous links that can direct the selection of synchronization options on a port-by-port basis for all the switches in the NoC, based on timing and layout constraints. A final case study illustrates how a cost-effective GALS NoC can be assembled, placed and routed by exploiting the flexibility of the architecture and the outcomes of the exploration framework, thus proving the viability and effectiveness of the design platform.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457116","","Clocks;Delay;Design automation;Frequency synchronization;Network interfaces;Network synthesis;Network-on-a-chip;Space exploration;Switches;Timing","clock distribution networks;logic design;network-on-chip","Mesochronous link;clock tree distribution;cost effective GALS NOC;design space exploration;dual clock FIFO;flexible GALS NOC;network interfaces;network-on-chip","","4","","25","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A methodology for propagating design tolerances to shape tolerances for use in manufacturing","Banerjee, S.; Agarwal, K.B.; Chin-Ngai Sze; Nassif, S.; Orshansky, M.","Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010","20100429","2010","","","1273","1278","The move to low-k1 lithography makes it increasingly difficult to print feature sizes which are a small fraction of the wavelength of light. Manufacturing processes currently treat a target layout as a fixed requirement for lithography. However, in reality layout features may vary within certain bounds without violating design constraints. The knowledge of such tolerances, coupled with models for process variability, can help improve the manufacturability of layout features while still meeting design requirements. In this paper, we propose a methodology to convert electrical slack in a design to shape slack or tolerances on individual layout shapes using a two-phase approach. In the first step, we redistribute delay slack to generate delay bounds on individual cells using linear programming. In the second phase, which is solved as a quadratic program, we convert these delay bounds to shape tolerances to maximize the process window of each shape. The shape tolerances produced by our methodology can be used within a process-window optical proximity correction (PWOPC) flow to reduce delay errors arising from variations in the lithographic process. Our experiments on 45 nm SOI cells using accurate process models show that the use of our shape slack generation in conjunction with PWOPC reduces delay errors from 3.6% to 1.4%, on average, compared to the simplistic way of tolerance band generation.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457002","DFM;design-intent;process-window optical proximity correction;tolerance bands","Delay;Design methodology;Error correction;Image motion analysis;Linear programming;Lithography;Manufacturing processes;Optical propagation;Shape;Virtual manufacturing","integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit manufacture;linear programming;lithography;proximity effect (lithography);silicon-on-insulator","SOI cells;delay bounds;delay slack;design tolerance;layout features;linear programming;lithographic process;low-k1 lithography;manufacturing process;process variability;process window optical proximity correction;quadratic program;shape tolerance;size 45 nm;target layout;tolerance band generation","","1","","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the determination of the robustness based on arbitrary revisions is computationally expensive, an efficient set-based approach that uses a symbolic encoding as Binary Decision Diagrams is presented. Moreover, a methodology for the integration of the optimization of the robustness into a design space exploration is proposed.

Hence, aging-resilient design methodologies are necessary to address this issue in order to improve reliability, preferably with minimal impact on the area, power and performance. This work offers two major contributions to the aging-resilient circuit design methodology literature. First, it introduces a novel sensor circuit that can detect the aging of pipeline architectures by monitoring the arrival time of data signals at flip-flops. The area overhead of the proposed circuit is estimated to be less than 45% compared to that of previous approaches, which are over 95%. To ensure the accuracy of its operation, a comprehensive timing analysis is performed on the proposed circuit including the influence of process variations. As a second contribution, this work presents an innovative correction technique to reduce the probability of timing failures caused by aging. This method employs novel reconfigurable flip-flops, which operate as normal flip-flops as long as the circuit is fresh, but function as time-borrowing flip-flops once the circuit ages. This unique flip-flop design allows utilization of the advantages of the time-borrowing technique while avoiding potential race conditions that can be created by employing such a technique. It is shown via simulations that by employing the proposed design methodology, the probability of timing failures in the aged circuits can be reduced by as much as 10X for various benchmark circuits.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457203","Aging;Diagnostics and Built-in tests;Fault-Tolerance;Negative/Positive Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI/PBTI);Process Variation;Reliability;Timing Analysis","Aging;Circuits;Degradation;Design methodology;Flip-flops;Hot carrier injection;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Timing;Titanium compounds","VLSI;flip-flops;hot carriers;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;transistor circuits","aging-resilient design;correction circuit;deep nano-scale regime VLSI circuit reliability;detection circuit;flip-flop design;hot carrier injection;innovative correction technique;negative bias temperature instability;pipelined architecture;process variations;reconfigurable flip-flops;sensor circuit;time-dependent performance degradation;timing failure probability;transistor aging","","7","","24","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The required test clock frequency with a high resolution can be obtained by specifying the information in the test patterns, which is then shifted into the delay control stages to configure the launch and capture clock generation circuit (LCCG) embedded on-chip.

The IC industry is facing a huge paradox. On one hand, with the slowing of the performance and power gains provided by scaling, designers need to find new ways of delivering value to their customers. Historically this has meant creating more application specialized chips and systems. On the other hand the rising NRE costs for chip design (now over $10M/chip) has caused the number of chip design starts to fall. Everyone today seems to be talking about building programmable platforms to ensure the total available market is large enough to justify the chip design costs. To get out of this paradox, we need to change the way we think about chip design. Reducing digital NRE costs requires moving the end user designers up a level in abstraction. For many reasons I don't believe that either the current SoC, or high-level language effort will succeed. Instead, we should acknowledge that working out the interactions in a complex design is complex, and will cost a lot of money, even when we do it well. The key is to leverage this work over a broader class of chips. This approach leads to the idea of building chip-generators and not chips. That is instead of building a programmable chip to meet a broad class of application needs, you create a virtual programmable chip, that is MUCH more flexible than any real chip. The application designer (the new chip designer) will then configure this substrate to optimize for their application. The generator will take this information and then create the desired chip. While there are many very hard problems that need to be addressed to make this work, but none of them seem insurmountable. In fact I will provide some examples which indicate the promise of this approach like having the generator choose the core that is the most energy efficient for your application mix.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457119","","Buildings;Chip scale packaging;Costs;Design optimization;Digital integrated circuits;Energy efficiency;High level languages;Performance gain","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;programmable circuits","chip design costs;digital design;integrated circuit industry;programmable platforms;virtual programmable chip","","1","","","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we apply power gating to structured ASICs for leakage power reduction. We present a power-gated via-configurable logic block (PGVCLB) and a power gated design flow mostly using existing standard cell design tools. We can configure PGVCLBs in a design to implement fine-grained power gating, coarse-grained/cluster-based power gating or even distributed sleep transistor network (DSTN).

This is also true for communication schedule synthesis where key decisions are taken early because of interactions with the suppliers. The possibility of change necessitates a design process that can analyze schedules for robustness to uncertainties, e.g., changes in estimated task durations or communication load. A robust design would be able to accommodate these changes incrementally without changes in the system scheduling, thus reducing validation times and increasing reusability. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the info-gap decision theory that provides a systematic scheme for analyzing robustness of schedules by computing the greatest horizon of uncertainty that still satisfies the performance requirements.

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a new challenge in wireless sensor design. In our project we are proposing an ultra-sonic measurement system to find malfunctions within structures. Examples of such structures are aircraft bodies and the wings of a wind turbine. It is required to allow for long term monitoring from a single battery or even using energy scavenging techniques. First of all the measurement algorithms are analyzed. Here we have to find a trade-off between energy consumption of the sensor, required memory size, computational power; duty cycle and timing jitter between actuator and sensors. Most important method to control the energy consumption of the system is an efficient duty cycle control. As most of the time the sensor is sleeping the overall timing of the system has to be maintained and refreshed in a continuous manner. A high timing accuracy results also in higher power consumption during sleep mode, while a low power RC oscillator needs a higher refresh rate. For the wireless system we need to trade-off between power consumption during active mode and data rates. While we are able to transfer more data in a shorter period of time with a high performance system, the overall energy consumption with low data rates could be higher if the on-time of the RF (radio-frequency) frontends is much longer even if the RF-frontends consumes less power in a low data rate mode.

Our test generation framework takes into account process variations and signal noise in selecting the test stimulus, which minimizes the number of misclassified devices.

One way to solve this problem is to reset only certain registers and rely on a software initialization sequence to reset other registers. This approach, however, may allow unknown values (also called X-values) in uninitialized registers to leak to other registers, leaving the design in a nondeterministic state. Although logic simulation can find some X-problems, it is not accurate and may miss bugs. A recent approach based on symbolic simulation can handle Xs accurately; however, it is not scalable. In this work we analyze the characteristics of X-problems and propose a methodology that leverages the accuracy of formal X-analysis and can scale to large designs. This is achieved by our novel partitioning techniques and the intelligent use of waveforms as stimulus. We applied our methodology to an industrial design and successfully identified several Xs unknown to the designers, including three real bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457048","","Arithmetic;Circuits;Computer bugs;Hardware;Logic;Registers;Routing;Scalability;Signal design;Testing","logic design;logic simulation;waveform analysis","RTL design;X-problem;design complexity;industrial design;logic simulation;partitioning technique;register reset;reset nondeterminism;reset signal routing;scalable X-analysis methodology;software initialization sequence;symbolic simulation;waveform","","1","","12","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, cross-layer resilient systems, which distribute the responsibility for tolerating errors, device variation, and aging across the system stack, have the potential to provide the resilience required to implement reliable, high-performance, low-power systems in future fabrication processes at significantly lower cost. These systems can implement less-frequent resilience tasks in software to save power and chip area, can tune their reliability guarantees to the needs of applications, and can use the information available at each level in the system stack to optimize performance and power consumption. In this paper, we outline an approach to cross-layer system design that describes resilience as a set of tasks that systems must perform in order to detect and tolerate errors and variation. We then present strawman examples of how this task-based design process could be used to implement general-purpose computing and SoC systems, drawing on previous work and identifying key areas for future research.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456960","","Aging;Circuits;Computer architecture;Costs;Energy consumption;Error correction;Error correction codes;Fabrication;Power system reliability;Resilience","general purpose computers;logic design;optimisation;power consumption;reliability;system-on-chip","SoC systems;cross layer resilience design techniques;general purpose computing;performance optimize;power consumption;reliability;strawman examples","","11","","51","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, these systems expose a set of dynamic parameters which can be tuned at run-time to achieve a specified Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of performance. A run-time manager operating system module is in charge of matching the specified QoS with the available platform resources by manipulating the overall degree of task-level parallelism of each application as well as the frequency of operation of each of the system cores. In this paper, we introduce a design space exploration framework for enabling and supporting enhanced resource management through software re-configuration on an industrial multicore platform. From one side, the framework operates at design time to identify a set of promising operating points which represent the optimal trade-off in terms of the target power consumption and performance. The operating points are used after the system has been deployed to support an enhanced resource management policy. This is done by a light-weight resource management layer which filters and selects the optimal parallelism of each application and operating frequency of each core to achieve the QoS constraints imposed by the external world and/or the user. We show how the proposed design-time and run-time techniques can be used to optimally manage the resources of a multiple-stream MPEG4 encoding chip dedicated to automotive cognitive safety tasks.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457211","","Aerospace industry;Application software;Design methodology;Frequency;Operating systems;Quality of service;Resource management;Runtime;Space exploration;Vehicle dynamics","multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers);power consumption;quality of service;resource allocation","QoS;dynamic parameters;industrial design space exploration;multicore systems;power consumption;quality of service;resource management;run-time manager operating system","","7","","12","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are considered as an ideal candidate to implement flexible electronics on low-cost substrates. Most TFT technologies, however, have only mono-type - either n- or p-type - devices and thus modern design technologies for silicon-based electronics cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a novel design style Pseudo-CMOS for flexible electronics that uses only mono-type TFTs while achieving comparable performance with the complementary-type designs. The manufacturing cost and complexity can therefore be significantly reduced while the circuit yield and reliability are also enhanced with the built-in capability of post-fabrication tuning. Some standard cells have been designed and fabricated in p-type organic and n-type InGaZnO (IGZO) TFT technologies which successfully verify the superiority of the proposed Pseudo-CMOS design style. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design solution that has proven superior performance for both types of TFT technologies.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457220","","Circuit optimization;Flexible electronics;Manufacturing;Organic thin film transistors;Plastics;RFID tags;Silicon;Substrates;Thermal degradation;Thin film transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;flexible electronics;indium compounds;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;organic semiconductors;thin film circuits;thin film transistors","InGaZnO;circuit reliability;circuit yield;flexible electronic design style;mono type thin film transistors;organic TFT;post fabrication tuning;pseudo CMOS;standard cell","","4","","11","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through Silicon Via (TSV), which provides communication links for dies in vertical direction, is a critical design issue in 3D integration. Just like other components, the fabrication and bonding of TSVs can fail. A failed TSV may cause a number of known-good-dies that are stacked together to be discarded. This can severely increase the cost and decrease the yield as the number of dies to be stacked increases. A redundant TSV architecture with reasonable cost for ASICs is proposed in this paper. Design issues including recovery rate and timing problem are addressed. Based on probabilistic models, some interesting findings are reported. First, the probability that three or more TSVs are failed in a tier is less than 0.002%. Assumption of that there are at most two failed TSVs in a tier is sufficient to cover 99.998% of all possible faulty free and faulty cases. Next, with one redundant TSV allocated to one TSV block, limiting the number of TSVs in each TSV block to be no greater than 50 and 25 leads to 90% and 95% recovery rates when 2 failed TSVs are assumed. Finally, analysis on overall yield shows that the proposed design can successfully recover most of the failed chips and increase the yield of TSV bonding to 99.99%. This can effectively reduce the cost of manufacturing 3D ICs.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457218","","Bonding;Costs;Fabrication;Failure analysis;Manufacturing;Redundancy;Silicon;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Through-silicon vias;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;probability;redundancy;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D integrated circuit;3D integration;3D technology;ASIC;TSV bonding;TSV redundancy;application specific integrated circuit;communication links;failed chips;faulty cases;faulty free;form-factor;known-good-dies;probabilistic models;recovery rate;redundant TSV architecture;through silicon via;timing problem","","36","2","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of a systematic IR-drop failure identification technique engenders a highly increased failure analysis time/cost and significant yield loss. In this paper, we propose a failure-adaptive test scheme that enables a fast differentiation of the IR-drop induced failure from the actual defects of the chip. The proposed technique debugs the failing chips using low IR-drop vectors that are custom-generated from the observed faulty response. Since these special vectors are designed in such a way that all the actual defects captured by the original vectors are still manifestable, their application can clearly pinpoint whether the root cause of failure is IR-drop or not, thus eliminating reliance on an intrusive debugging process that incurs quite a high cost. Such a test scheme further enables effective yield recovery from failing chips by passing the ones validated by the debugging vectors whose IR-drop level matches the functional mode. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme delivers a significant IR-drop reduction in the second test (debugging) phase, thus enabling a highly effective IR-drop failure identification and yield recovery at a slightly increased test cost.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457236","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Debugging;Failure analysis;Noise reduction;Silicon;Timing;Very large scale integration;Voltage","integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;integrated logic circuits","cost-effective IR-drop failure identification;failing chips;failure-adaptive test scheme;intrusive debugging process;yield recovery","","1","1","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is achieved by scan chain data encoding and decoding. The methodology is compatible with EDA tools design and power gating control flows. A detailed analysis of the proposed methodology's capability in detecting and correcting errors is given including the area overhead and energy consumption of the protection circuitry. The methodology is validate using FPGA and show that it is possible to correct all single errors with Hamming code and detect all multiple errors with CRC-16 code. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in the area of reliable power gating designs through state monitoring and correction.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457233","","Decoding;Electronic design automation and methodology;Encoding;Energy consumption;Error correction;Error correction codes;Monitoring;Protection;Registers;Switching circuits","Hamming codes;decoding;electronic design automation;encoding;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability","CRC-16 code;EDA tools design;FPGA;Hamming code;decoding;energy consumption;idle circuits;leakage power;power gating designs;power switches;power-gated circuits;reliability problem;scan based methodology;scan chain data encoding;state retention registers","","2","","8","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study a set of techniques to design an energy- and endurance-aware PCM cache. We also modeled the timing, energy, endurance, and area of PCM caches and integrated them into a PCM cache simulator to evaluate the techniques.

Thus, the question is when the RTOS must be introduced in this step by step refinement process. This paper proposes a four-level RTOS-aware refinement methodology that, starting from an untimed TLM SystemC description of the whole system, progressively introduce HW/SW partitioning, timing, device driver and RTOS functionalities, till to obtain an accurate model of the final platform, where SW tasks run upon an RTOS hosted by QEMU and HW components are modeled by cycle accurate TLM descriptions.

Such an approach can make the modeling process much easier and less restrictive than before, and more amenable for practical measured data. The new method is based on a subspace identification method to build the thermal models, which first generates a Hankel matrix of Markov parameters, from which state matrices are obtained through minimum square optimization. To overcome the overfitting problems of the subspace method, the new method employs an overfitting mitigation technique to improve model accuracy and predictive ability.

RALF is based on the compilation of a circuit to deterministic decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF), a representation for Boolean formulas that can be more succinct than BDDs. Our algorithm can solve a large set of MCNC benchmark circuits within 5 minutes, enabling an optimality study of Monte Carlo simulation, a popular estimation method for reliability analysis, on real benchmark circuits. Our study shows that Monte Carlo simulation with a small set of random vectors generally has a high fidelity for the computation of full-chip fault rates and the criticality of single gates. While we focus on reliability analysis, RALF can also be used to efficiently locate random pattern resistant faults. This can be used to identify where methods other than random simulation should be used for accurate criticality calculations and where to enhance the testability of a circuit.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456947","","Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computational modeling;Data structures;Fault tolerance;Logic circuits;Pattern analysis","Boolean algebra;Monte Carlo methods;deterministic algorithms;estimation theory;fault tolerance;logic circuits;logic design;random processes;reliability;vectors","Boolean formulas;MCNC benchmark circuits;Monte Carlo simulation;RALF;deterministic decomposable negation normal form;estimation method;exact algorithm;fault tolerant logic synthesis;full chip fault rate;logic circuit;logic circuit reliability;random pattern resistant faults;random vectors;reliability analysis;reliability analysis for logic faults","","3","","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We discuss the definition of functional broadside tests for the case where hardware reset is used for bringing the circuit into a known state before functional operation starts. We show that the set of reachable states for a circuit with hardware reset contains the set of reachable states based on a synchronizing sequence. Consequently, the set of functional broadside tests and the set of detectable faults for a circuit with hardware reset contain those obtained based on a synchronizing sequence.

Specifically, we introduce a method called loop flattening that demonstrates how the evaluation of the timing statistics in the complex, highly structured circuit can be reduced to that of a single chain of component circuits. To then very quickly evaluate the timing delay of a single chain, we employ a statistical method based on importance sampling augmented with targeted, high-dimensional, spherical sampling.

In a circuit optimization context, the designer's simplified equations for the circuit serve as the easier problem. These simplified design equations are easy to write as they need not be completely accurate and have intuitive, well-understood solutions.

We propose a noise index model, NIM, which can be used to predict the mismatch between expected and real path delays. The noise index considers both the proximity of switching activity to the path and physical characteristics of the design.

Many of previous works have focused on the automation of its topology design, since the topology largely determines its overall performance. For this purpose, they mostly require a switch library which includes all possible switch configurations (e.g. the number of in/output ports and data width) with their implementation costs such as delay, area, and power. More precisely, they characterize the switches by synthesizing them with a common design objective (e.g. minimizing area) and common design constraints for a given gate-level design library. The implementation costs are used in evaluating the topologies throughout the topology synthesis. The major drawback of single switch library approach is that it forces the topology synthesis methods to search the best topology with the assumption that all the switches comprising a topology will be implemented (synthesized) with a common design objective and common design constraints. Such assumption prevents them from exploring diverse combinations of the switches for a topology from the implementation perspective. To tackle this issue, we propose a topology synthesis method with multiple switch libraries, where the switch libraries are prepared with different design objectives and design constraints. The experimental results show that the power consumption and the area of optimal topologies can be saved by up to 67.1% and 27.2%, respectively, by the proposed method with negligible synthesis time overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457030","","Costs;Delay;Design automation;Libraries;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network synthesis;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Switches;System-on-a-chip","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;network topology;network-on-chip","gate-level design library;on-chip interconnection network;switch library;system-on-chips;topology synthesis","","2","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenges of managing energy efficiency and performance in SoC designs often results in sleepless nights searching for a solution. Today processors have to deliver more computational power, while maintaining flexibility and delivering the lowest power envelope simultaneously. These requirements are fundamentally contradictory in nature. This paradox keeps designers up at night trying to develop the perfect tradeoff between energy efficiency, flexibility and performance. This session will discuss some of the latest and most advanced techniques in power and performance management. Topics will include clocking, controlling idle and active power, optimizing data pipelines, hardware accelerators, advancements in microprocessor architecture and utilizing optimized libraries, mfg process, tools and design flow to ensure optimal power and performance ratios. The challenges of low-power microprocessor design are unique in the sense that a significant power savings is desired with little or no performance and area impact. ARM has developed a series of optimized processor architectures and optimized libraries to provide the highest level of flexibility in meeting your area, performance and power requirements.

Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. An efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in Kirchhoff's voltage law is suggested in this paper. By using this scheme, the non-convex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457151","CMOS op-amps;geometric programming;monomial;posynomial;power optimization","CMOS technology;Computational modeling;Design optimization;Kirchhoff's Law;Operational amplifiers;Optimization methods;Semiconductor device modeling;Solid modeling;Space technology;Subspace constraints","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;SPICE;geometric programming;operational amplifiers;optimisation","CMOS op-amps;CMOS transistors;HSPICE simulation;Kirchhoff's voltage law;analog design;nonconvex constraint;posynomial equality;power optimization;single-space models;sub-micron technologies;sub-space based geometric programming;sub-space max-monomial modeling","","6","","12","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"SAT based multi-net rip-up-and-reroute for manufacturing hotspot removal","Fan Yang; Yici Cai; Qiang Zhou; Jiang Hu","Dept. of CST, Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010","20100429","2010","","","1369","1372","Manufacturing hotspots are the layout patterns which cause excessive difficulties to manufacturing process. Design rules are effective at handling sizing/spacing induced hotspots, but are inadequate at dealing with topological hotspots. In wire routings, existing approaches often remove the hotspots through iteratively ripping up and rerouting one net at a time guided by litho-simulations. This procedure can be very time-consuming because litho-simulation is typically very slow and the rerouting may result in new hotspots due to its heuristic nature. In this paper, we propose a new approach for improving the efficiency of hotspot removal. In our approach, multiple nets in each hotspot region are simultaneously ripped up and rerouted based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT). The hotspot patterns, which are described and stored in a pre-built library, are forbidden to appear in the reroute through SAT constraints. Since multiple nets are simultaneously processed and SAT can guarantee to find a feasible solution if it exists, our approach can greatly accelerate the convergence on manufacturability. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that our approach can remove over 90% of the hotspots in less than one minute on circuits with more than 20K nets and hundreds of hotspots.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457024","","Acceleration;Circuit simulation;Costs;Libraries;Lithography;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Routing;Runtime;Wire","Boolean algebra;circuit layout CAD;computability;design for manufacture","Boolean satisfiability;SAT based multi-net rip-up-and-reroute;SAT constraints;benchmark circuits;design rules;hotspot patterns;hotspot region;layout patterns;litho-simulations;manufacturability;manufacturing hotspot removal;topological hotspots;wire routings","","1","","13","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper at hand proposes a viable, effective and cost efficient solution for the second problem. The paper presents a new method for Built-in Self-Diagnosis (BISD). The core of the method is an extreme response compaction architecture, which for the first time enables an autonomous on-chip evaluation of test responses with negligible hardware overhead. The key advantage of this architecture is that all data, which is relevant for a subsequent diagnosis, is gathered during just one test session. The BISD method comprises a hardware scheme, a test pattern generation approach and a diagnosis algorithm. Experiments conducted with industrial designs substantiate that the additional hardware overhead introduced by the BISD method is on average about 15% of the BIST area, and the same diagnostic resolution can be obtained as for external testing.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456997","Diagnosis;Logic BIST","Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Computer architecture;Costs;Embedded computing;Encoding;Fault diagnosis;Hardware;Logic testing;Test pattern generators","embedded systems;program diagnostics;system-on-chip","BISD;BIST;diagnostic information;embedded memories;onchip evaluation;scan based built-in self diagnosis","","7","","37","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, we also perform logic synthesis and technology mapping, demonstrating that synthesized circuits mapped with the library of ambipolar logic gates dissipate 57% less power than CMOS circuits.

As a result, there has always been a strong interest in developing efficient admission control algorithms for various setups. In this paper, we propose a novel constant-time admission control test for the Deadline Monotonic (DM) policy, i.e., the time taken by the test does not depend on the number of admitted tasks currently in the system. While it is possible to adapt known utilization bounds from the literature to derive constant-time admission control tests (e.g., the Liu and Layland bound, or the more recent hyperbolic bound), the test we propose is less pessimistic. We illustrate this analytically where possible and through a set of detailed experiments.

However, based on the observation that useful slack is often quantized, we have developed an approach that effectively and efficiently allocates execution and storage slack to jointly optimize system lifetime and cost. While exploring less than 1.4% of the slack allocation design space, our approach consistently outperforms alternative slack allocation techniques to find sets of designs within 1.4% of the lifetime-cost Pareto-optimal front.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457065","","Circuit faults;Communication switching;Cost function;Design optimization;Embedded system;Failure analysis;Network-on-a-chip;Resource management;Switches;Thermal management","integrated circuit design;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","NoC-based MPSoC;cost-effective slack allocation;embedded systems;lifetime-cost Pareto-optimal front;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;network-on-chip;slack allocation design space techniques;storage resources","","2","","19","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design of complex system is essentially about connections: Connection of concepts, connection of objects, connection of teams.

Connections can produce systems that offer more than the sum of the components but they can also yield to systems that are less powerful than the sum of the components or that are so compromised by their interactions that they do not work at all. Collaboration is the name of the game for design, for production, for operation of multi-scale systems. There is increasingly less distance between design and operation of systems. An efficient management of interactions among deployed parts of a larger system requires principles that are common to the design methods developed at the bleeding edge of technology.

The integration of formerly separate functionality into a single multicore system introduces new inter-core timing dependencies, resulting from the common use of the now shared resources. In order to conservatively bound the delay due to the shared resource accesses, upper bounds on the potential amount of conflicting requests from other processors are required. This paper proposes a method that captures the request distances of multiple shared resource accesses by single tasks and also by multiple tasks that are dynamically scheduled on the same processor. Unlike previous work, we acknowledge the fact that on a single processor, tasks will not actually execute in parallel, but in alternation. This consideration leads to a more accurate load model. In a final step, the approach is extended to allow addressing also dynamic cache misses that do not occur at predefined times but surface dynamically during the execution of the tasks.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456951","","Delay;Multicore processing;Multiprocessing systems;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;System analysis and design;System-on-a-chip;Timing;Upper bound","multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling;real-time systems;resource allocation","dynamic cache misses;inter-core timing dependency;multicore system;multiprocessor systems;performance analysis;real-time system design;real-time system verification;shared resource load;task scheduling;timing behavior prediction","","11","","21","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such architectures are designed for flexibility to support a broad range of target applications, including advanced algorithms with significant processing and data requirements. Clearly, strong performance of applications in this category is an extremely relevant metric for demonstrating the full performance potential of heterogeneous computing platforms. One such example, a film grain noise reduction application for high-definition video, which is composed of multiple image processing tasks, requires enormous data rates due to its large input image size and real-time processing constraints. This application is especially representative of highly parallel, heterogeneous, data-intensive programs that can properly exploit the advantages offered by computing platforms with multiple heterogeneous reconfigurable processing elements. To accomplish this task and meet the above requirements, a bandwidth-optimized external memory controller has been designed for use with a heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture and its NoC interconnect. With the help of the application described above, this paper evaluates the proposed architecture in two forms: (1) with a basic memory controller IP and (2) with the advanced memory controller design.

Such hardware Trojan circuitry has been shown to be capable of shutting down the main processor after a random number of cycles, broadcasting sensitive information over the bus, and bypassing software authentication mechanisms. In this work, we propose an architecture that can prevent information leakage due to such malicious hardware. Our technique is based on guaranteeing certain behavior in the memory system, which will be checked at an external guardian core that ??approves?? each memory request. By sitting between off-chip memory and the main core, the guardian core can monitor bus activity and verify the compiler-defined correctness of all memory writes. Experimental results on a conventional x86 platform demonstrate that application binaries can be statically re-instrumented to coordinate with the guardian core to monitor off-chip access, resulting in less than 60% overhead for the majority of the studied benchmarks.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456930","","Broadcasting;Circuits;Hardware;Information security;Intellectual property;Leak detection;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Process design;Production facilities","industrial property;microprocessor chips;security of data","defense related systems;design tools;guardian core;hardware Trojan circuitry;information leakage detection;information leakage prevention;malicious hardware;memory bus;microprocessor components;military systems;software authentication mechanisms;third party intellectual property","","2","","13","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of the method is to efficiently simulate failure-time dispersion in circuits subjected to die-level stress effects. A Design of Experiments (DoE) with a quasi-linear complexity is used to build a Response Surface Model (RSM) of the time-dependent circuit behavior. This reduces simulation time, when compared to random-sampling techniques, and guarantees good coverage of the circuit factor space. The DoE consists of a linear screening design, to filter out important circuit factors, followed by a resolution 5 fractional factorial regression design to model the circuit behavior.

In this paper, we propose an abstraction-guided simulation approach aiming to cover hard-to-reach states in functional verification of microprocessors. A Markov model is constructed utilizing the high level functional specification, i.e. ISA. Such model integrates vector correlations. Furthermore, several strategies utilizing abstraction information are proposed as an effective guidance to the test generation. Experimental results on two complex microprocessors show that our approach is more efficient in covering hard-to-reach states than similar methods.

We observe that deploying an excessive number of TEC devices and/or providing the TEC devices with an improper supply current might adversely result in the overheating of the chip, rendering the cooling system ineffective. A large amount of supply current could even cause the thermal runaway of the system. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the deployment of the integrated TEC devices and their supply current setting as a system-level design problem. We propose a greedy algorithm to determine the deployment of TEC devices and a convex programming based scheme for setting the supply current levels. Leveraging the theory of inverse-positive matrix, we provide an optimality condition for the current setting algorithm. We have tested our algorithms on various benchmarks. We observe that our algorithms are able to determine the proper deployment and supply current level of the TEC devices which reduces the temperatures of the hot spots by as much as 7.5??C compared to the cases without integrated TEC devices.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457225","","Cooling;Current supplies;Design optimization;Greedy algorithms;Packaging;System-level design;System-on-a-chip;Thermoelectricity;Thin film devices;Transistors","cooling;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit packaging;matrix algebra;thermoelectric devices;thin film circuits","chip overheating;chip package;compact thermal model;convex programming;greedy algorithm;integrated thin-film;inverse-positive matrix;on-chip active cooling system;system-level design;thin-film thermoelectric coolers","","5","","21","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our processor design supports dynamic partial reconfiguration allowing the creation of dedicated register file sizes for different applications. Therefore, valuable area can be freed and utilized for other implementations running on the same FPGA when not the full register file size is needed. Our design requires 924 slices on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro device for dynamically placing a chunk of 8 registers, and places registers in multiples of 8 registers to simplify the design.

SFUs are arithmetic functional units that operate using a predictor for the carry signal, which reduces the critical path delay. The performance of these units is determined by the success in the prediction of the carry value, i.e. the hit rate of the prediction. Hence SFUs reduce critical path at a low cost, but they cannot be used in HLS with the current techniques. In order to use them, it is necessary to include hardware support to recover from mispredictions of the carry signals. In this paper, we present techniques for designing a datapath controller for seamless deployment of SFUs in HLS. We have developed two techniques for this goal. The first approach stops the execution of the entire datapath for each misprediction and resumes execution once the correct value of the carry is known. The second approach decouples the functional unit suffering from the misprediction from the rest of the datapath. Hence, it allows the rest of the SFUs to carry on execution and be at different scheduling states at different times. Experiments show that it is possible to reduce execution time by as much as 38% and by 33% on average.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457102","Dynamic scheduling;HLS;speculation","Adders;Arithmetic;Circuits;Costs;Delay;Design optimization;Dynamic scheduling;Hardware;High level synthesis;Resumes","high level synthesis;optimisation;parallel programming;processor scheduling","HLS;SFU;arithmetic functional units;critical path delay;datapath controller;high level synthesis;speculative functional units","","2","","20","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus the designer of system updates does not know the exact system configuration. This turns the proof of system feasibility into a critical challenge. This paper presents the architecture of a framework and associated protocols enabling updates in embedded systems while ensuring safe operation w.r.t. non-functional properties.

These timing defects can be caused by process variations, crosstalk, and power-supply noise, as well as by physical defects such as resistive opens and shorts. Timing-aware ATPG tools have been developed for SDD detection. However, they only use static timing analysis reports for path-length calculation and neglect important parameters such as process variations, crosstalk, and power-supply noise, which can induce small delays into the circuit and impact the timing of targeted paths. In this paper, we present an efficient pattern evaluation and selection procedure for screening SDDs that are caused by physical defects and by delays added to paths by process variations and crosstalk. In this procedure, the best patterns for SDDs are selected from a large repository test set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method sensitizes more long paths and detects more SDDs with a much smaller pattern count compared with a commercial timing-aware ATPG tool.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457036","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit noise;Circuit testing;Crosstalk;Delay;Integrated circuit noise;Integrated circuit reliability;Integrated circuit technology;Integrated circuit testing;Timing","automatic test pattern generation;crosstalk;delays;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing","crosstalk;high quality pattern selection;integrated circuit quality;integrated circuit reliability;pattern evaluation;power supply noise;process variations;small delay defect screening;timing aware ATPG","","5","","21","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More precisely, we prove that the step sizes of step doubling based globally adaptive fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg methods always converge to a constant value regardless of the initial power profile, thermal profile, and error threshold during dynamic thermal analysis. Thus, these widely-used techniques are unable to adapt to the requirements of individual problems, resulting in poor performance. We also determine the effect of using a number of temperature update functions and step size adaptation methods for dynamic thermal analysis, and identify the most promising approach considered.

These composites exhibit capacitance per unit planar area of ~1.0 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> or 40 mF/g for a ~100 ??m-thick polymer substrate, with only a small predictable decrease in capacitance immediately after heating to 100??C followed by constant capacitance up to 300??C.

All previous research on error tolerance has focused on identifying such defective but acceptable chips during post-fabrication testing to improve yield. In this paper, we explore a completely new approach to exploit error tolerance based on the following observation: If certain deviations from the nominal output values are acceptable, then we can exploit this flexibility during circuit design to reduce circuit area and delay as well as to increase yield. The specific metric of error tolerance we focus on is error rate, i.e., how often the circuit produces erroneous outputs. We propose a new logic synthesis approach for the new problem of identifying how to exploit a given error rate threshold to maximally reduce the area of the synthesized circuit.

In this paper, we propose a general method to eliminate the nondeterminism resulted from clock domain crossing. This method does not assume any specific relationship among the clocks. Instead, to adapt to various clock conditions, an automatic configuration procedure and a periodic error canceling mechanism, which only require trivial hardware support, are proposed by analyzing the deterministic boundaries theoretically.

"Clock gating approaches by IOEX graphs and cluster efficiency plots","Srinivas, J.; Jairam, S.","CSE, Penn State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010","20100429","2010","","","638","641","Clock Gating has been the most widely used method to reduce dynamic power for digital designs. Increasingly the need to assess the quality of a clock gating implementation has resulted in generation of various benchmarking criteria. These criteria however fail to provide a feel to the designer about quality of a current implementation and the scope available for further clock gating. Prior work has also reported various datapath based clock gating techniques to optimize for dynamic power. In this paper we present a new approach to analyze this problem through the IO Exclusivity (IOEX) graphs and Cluster Efficiency (CE) plots. The IOEX graph captures the datapath activity across the sequential elements normalized to the source clock. This exercise produces sequential elemental clusters or modules, which are amenable to clock gating.

One bit transform (1BT) based ME algorithms have low computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a high performance reconfigurable hardware architecture of 1BT based multiple reference frame (MRF) ME. The proposed ME hardware architecture performs full search ME for 4 Macroblocks and 4 reference frames in parallel. The proposed hardware is faster than the 1BT based ME hardware reported in the literature even though it is capable of searching in 4 reference frames. MRF ME increases the ME performance at the expense of increased computational complexity. The reconfigurability of the proposed ME hardware is used to statically configure the number and selection of reference frames based on the application requirements in order to trade-off ME performance and computational complexity. The proposed hardware architecture is implemented in Verilog HDL. The MRF ME hardware consumes %65 of the slices in a Xilinx XC2VP30-7 FPGA. It can work at 191 MHz in the same FPGA and is capable of processing 83 1920 ?? 1080 full High Definition frames per second.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457171","FPGA;Hardware Implementation;Motion Estimation;Multiple Reference Frame;One Bit Transform","Computational complexity;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Filters;Hardware design languages;Kernel;Motion estimation;PSNR;Vectors;Video compression","field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;motion estimation;reconfigurable architectures;video coding","Verilog HDL;Xilinx XC2VP30-7 FPGA;multiple reference frame motion estimation;one bit transform;reconfigurable hardware architecture;video compression;video enhancement system","","1","","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The procedure seeks to maximize the subspace generated by a given number of samples, selected among an initial candidate set. The selection is based on a global criteria that chooses the sample whose associated vector adds more information to the existing subspace. However, the initial candidate set can be extremely large for high-dimensional systems, and thus the procedure can be costly. To improve efficiency we propose a scheme to incorporate information from low order moments to the basis with small extra cost, in order to extend the approximation to a wider region around the selected point. This will allow reduction of the initial candidate set without decreasing the level of confidence. We further improve the procedure by generating the global subspace based on the composition of local approximations. To achieve this, the initial candidates will be split into subsets that will be considered as independent regions, and in a first phase the procedure applied locally thus enabling improved efficiency and providing a framework for almost perfect parallelization.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457159","","Character generation;Costs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Frequency;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Sampling methods;Solid modeling","multidimensional systems;reduced order systems;sampling methods","global subspace;high-dimensional model order reduction;high-dimensional system;low moment-matching upgraded sampling;low order moment matching;multidimensional parameterized system;multipoint based methodology;sampling procedure","","1","","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the explicit parallelism given in the source program, our method also exploits the implicit parallelism which is due to the underlying synchronous model of computation and the data dependencies of the guarded actions.

In the first part of this work, it is shown that such a two-step approach fails to generate the most ambitious realizable specification bounds for mismatch-sensitive performances. In the second part of this work, a novel single-step approach to compute yield-optimized specification Pareto fronts is presented. Its optimization objectives are the realizable specification bounds themselves. Experimental results show that for mismatch-sensitive performances the resulting yield-optimized specification Pareto front is superior to the yield-aware specification Pareto front.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456971","","Analog computers;Analog integrated circuits;Circuit analysis computing;Circuit testing;Integrated circuit yield;Operational amplifiers;Pareto analysis;Pareto optimization;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation","Pareto optimisation;analogue integrated circuits","Pareto optimization approach;analog integrated circuit specifications;yield-optimized Pareto fronts","","2","","16","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method, called DEW, is able to simulate multiple level 1 cache configurations (different set sizes, associativities, and block sizes) with FIFO replacement policy. DEW utilizes a binomial tree based representation of cache configurations and a novel searching method to speed up simulation over single cache simulators like Dinero IV. Depending on different cache block sizes and benchmark applications, DEW operates around 8 to 40 times faster than Dinero IV. Dinero IV compares 2.17 to 19.42 times more cache ways than DEW to determine accurate miss rates.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457153","","Analytical models;Application specific processors;Australia;Cache memory;Computer aided instruction;Costs;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Process design;System performance","cache storage;circuit simulation;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;tree searching","DEW;Dinero IV;FIFO replacement policy;LRU replacement policy;binomial tree based representation;embedded processor system;energy estimation;fast level 1 cache simulation approach;first in first out replacement policy;searching method","","4","","21","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge in designing micro-scale energy harvesting systems is that miniature energy transducers (e.g., photovoltaic cells, thermo-electric generators, and fuel cells) output very low voltages (0-0.4V). Therefore, a fully on-chip power converter (usually based on a charge pump) is used to boost the output voltage of the energy transducer and transfer charge into an energy buffer for storage. However, the charge transfer capability of widely used linear charge pump based power converters degrades when used with ultra-low voltage energy transducers. This paper presents the design of a new tree topology charge pump that has a reduced charge sharing time, leading to an improved charge transfer capability. The proposed design has been implemented using 65nm technology and circuit simulations demonstrate that the proposed design results in an increase of up to 30% in harvested power compared to existing linear charge pumps.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457066","","Batteries;Biomedical transducers;Biosensors;Buffer storage;Charge pumps;Charge transfer;Implants;Low voltage;Power conversion;Wireless sensor networks","energy harvesting;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;network topology;power conversion;power convertors;transducers","charge transfer capability;efficient power conversion;energy buffer;energy harvesting;on-chip power converter;tree topology charge pump;ultra low voltage micro scale energy transducers","","6","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Logic values are implemented as sinusoidal signals. Sinusoidal signals of the same frequency are phase shifted by ?? to destructively interfere with each other, and represent the logic 0 and 1 values of Boolean Logic. These properties of sinusoids can be used to identify a signal without ambiguity. Thus, representing logic values as sinusoidal signals yields a realizable system of logic. The paper presents a logic gate family that can operate using the sinusoidal signals for logic 0 and logic 1 values. Due to orthogonality of sinusoid signals with different frequencies, multiple sinusoids could be transmitted on a single wire. This provides a natural way of implementing multilevel logic. Signals traveling long distances could take advantage of this fact and can share interconnect lines. Recent research in circuit design has made it possible to harvest sinusoidal signals of the same frequency and 180?? phase difference from a single resonant clock ring in a distributed manner. Other advantage of such a logic family is its immunity from external additive noise. The experiments in this paper indicate that this paradigm, when used to implement binary valued logic, yields an improvement in switching (dynamic) power.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457188","","Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic gates;Resonance;Signal processing;Wire","Boolean algebra;combinational circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;logic circuits;logic design","Boolean logic;additive noise;binary valued logic;circuit design;combinational logic circuit realization;digital logic;interconnect lines;logic gate family;multilevel logic;sinusoidal signals;sinusoidal supplies","","3","","11","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our framework features three control policies: 1. Progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2. Progressive-on-state-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep mode, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; 3.

In this work, a technique based on vector field analysis is presented for quickly extracting both static and dynamic stability characteristics of arbitrary SRAM topologies. It is shown that the traditional butterfly curve simulation for 6T cells is actually a special case of the proposed method. The proposed technique not only allows for standard SNM ??smallest-square?? measurements, but also enables tracing of the state-space separatrix, an operation critical for quantifying dynamic stability. It is established via importance sampling that cell characterization using a combination of both separatrix tracing and butterfly SNM measurements is significantly more correlated to cell failure rates then using SNM measurements alone.

The PUF we present in this paper, called PE-PUF, takes into account both process and environmental variations which magnifies chip-to-chip signature randomness and uniqueness. PE-PUF takes into account process variations, temperature, power supply noise and crosstalk; all these effects are major sources of variations and noise in integrated circuits. Designers would be able to select PE-PUF response by applying different input patterns.? Furthermore, PE-PUF imposes no routing constraints to the design.

The degradation in threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) due to NBTI is further affected by the initial value of V<sub>th</sub> from fabrication-induced process variation (PV). Addressing these challenges in embedded FPGA designs is possible, as FPGA reconfigurablility can be exploited to measure the exact timing degradation of an FPGA due to the joint effect of NBTI and PV at run time with low overhead. The gathered information can then be used to improve the run-time performance and reliability of FPGA designs without targeting the pessimistic worst case. In this paper, we present joint NBTI/PV-aware placement techniques for FPGAs, including NBTI/PV-aware timing analysis, region-based delay estimation, and a new move-acceptance procedure. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we combine PV measurements from 15 Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs with a model of NBTI. The proposed techniques reduce the effect of NBTI/PV by more than 60% for over 60% of the 15 FPGA chips used in the experiments, with a typical run-time overhead of 1.4-1.8X. The standalone move-acceptance procedure also produces good results with negligible run-time overhead, making it suitable for online FPGA compilation and optimization flows.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457107","","Degradation;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit reliability;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Runtime;Threshold voltage;Time measurement;Timing;Titanium compounds","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;nanoelectronics","FPGA optimization flows;FPGA reconfigurablility;Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA;embedded FPGA design;fabrication-induced process variation;move-acceptance procedure;nanoscale integrated circuit performance;nanoscale integrated circuit reliability;negative bias temperature instability;online FPGA compilation;process variation-aware placement;region-based delay estimation;threshold voltage","","5","","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of configuring an energy-efficient PDN under various constraints is subsequently formulated by using a controllable Markovian decision process (MDP) model and solved optimally as a policy optimization problem.

With power requirements already limiting chip performance, continuing to demand perfect, upset-free transistors would mean the end of scaling benefits. The big challenges in device variability and reliability are driven by uncommon tails in distributions, infrequent upsets, one-size-fits-all technology requirements, and a lack of information about the context of each operation. Solutions co-designed across traditional layer boundaries in our system stack can change the game, allowing architecture and software (a) to compensate for uncommon variation, environments, and events, (b) to pass down invariants and requirements for the computation, and (c) to monitor the health of collections of devices. Cross-layer codesign provides a path to continue extracting benefits from further scaled technologies despite the fact that they may be less predictable and more variable. While some limited multi-layer mitigation strategies do exist, to move forward redefining traditional layer abstractions and developing a framework that facilitates cross-layer collaboration is necessary.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456959","","Circuit noise;Convergence;Delay;Integrated circuit noise;Integrated circuit yield;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device noise;Space heating;Threshold voltage;Working environment noise","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;low-power electronics;optimisation","cross-layer collaboration;cross-layer optimization;device variability;reliability;traditional layer abstractions","","10","","25","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes new FPGA devices very advantageous for space and avionics computing. However, larger levels of integration makes FPGA's configuration memory more prone to suffer Multi-Cell Upset errors (MCUs), caused by a single radiation particle that can flip the content of multiple nearby cells. In particular, MCUs are on the rise for the new generation of SRAM-based FPGAs, since their configuration memory is based on volatile programming cells designed with smaller geometries that result more sensitive to proton- and heavy ion-induced effects. MCUs drastically limits the capabilities of specific hardening techniques adopted in space-based electronic systems, mainly based on Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). In this paper we describe a new placement algorithm for hardening TMR circuits mapped on SRAM-based FPGAs against the effects of MCUs. The algorithm is based on layout information of the FPGA's configuration memory and on metrics related to the logic and interconnection resources locations. Experimental results obtained from MCU static analysis on a set of benchmark circuits hardened by the proposed algorithm prove the efficiency of our approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456995","","Aerospace electronics;Circuits;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Ionizing radiation;Protons;Radiation hardening;Random access memory;Redundancy;Space technology","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;logic design","FPGA device;MCU static analysis;SRAM-based FPGA;TMR circuit hardening;benchmark circuit;configuration memory;layout information;multcell upset error;multiple cell upsets;placement algorithm;radiation particle;triple modular redundancy;volatile programming cell","","1","","11","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To fully exploit this potential, the architectural interface to vertically stacked memory must be streamlined. In this paper we present an efficient and flexible distributed memory interface for 3D-stacked DRAM. Our interface ensures ultra-low-latency access to the memory modules on top of each processing element (vertically local memory neighborhoods). Communication to these local modules do not travel through the NoC and takes full advantage of the lower latency of vertical interconnect, thus speeding up significantly the common case. The interface still supports a convenient global address space abstraction with high-latency remote access, due to the slower horizontal interconnect.

Construction of a compact and efficient model of such waveforms becomes even more challenging when manufacturing process and environmental variations are considered. This paper introduces a rigorous and robust foundation to mathematically model output waveforms under sources of variability and to compress the library data. The proposed approach is suitable for today's current source model (CSM) based ASIC libraries. It employs an orthonormal transformation to represent the output waveforms as a linear combination of some appropriately-derived basis waveforms. More significantly Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) is used to stratify the library waveforms into a small number of groups for which different sets of principle components are calculated. This stratification results in a very high compression ratio for the variational CSM library while meeting a maximum error tolerance. Interpolation and further compression is obtained by representing the coefficients as signomial functions of various parameters, e.g., input slew, load capacitance, supply voltage, and temperature.

Our virtual prototyping approach has been applied to the Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) specification revision 3.0 and verifies the influence of two newly specified algorithms, namely Ring Break Diagnosis and Sudden Signal Off detection, with respect to numerous network configurations.

Therefore, to maximize system performance, it is important to simultaneously consider the PE and on-chip memory architecture design. However, in a traditional MPSoC design flow, PE allocation and on-chip memory allocation are often considered independently. To tackle this problem, we propose the first PE and Memory Co-synthesis (PM-COSYN) framework for MPSoCs. One critical issue in such a memory-aware MPSoC design is how to utilize the available die area to achieve a balanced design between memory and computation subsystems. Therefore, the goal of PM-COSYN is to allocate PE and on-chip memory for MPSoCs with Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture such that system performance is maximized and the area constraint is met. The experimental results show that, PM-COSYN can synthesize NoC resource allocation according to the needs of the target task set. When comparing to a Simulated-Annealing method, PM-COSYN generates a comparable solution with much shorter CPU time.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457064","","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Memory architecture;Network synthesis;Network-on-a-chip;Parallel processing;Resource management;System performance;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","memory architecture;multiprocessing systems;network synthesis;network-on-chip;parallel processing;resource allocation","MPSoC;NoC resource allocation;PM-COSYN;concurrent memory access;memory bottleneck;memory co-synthesis;multiprocessor system-on-chip design;network-on-chip architecture;on-chip memory allocation;on-chip memory architecture design;processing element allocation;task-level parallelism","","0","","22","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The power efficiency of this Voltage Islanding technique comes at the cost of energy and area overhead due to the level shifters between voltage islands. Moreover, from the physical design perspective it is not desirable to have an excessive number of voltage islands on the chip. Considering voltage islanding at an early phase of design as during floorplanning of the PEs can address various of these issues. In this paper, we propose a new cost function for the floorplanning objective different from the traditional floorplanning objective. The new cost function not only includes the overall area requirement, but also incorporates the overall power consumption and the design constraint imposed on the maximum number of voltage islands. We propose a greedy heuristic based on the proposed cost function for the floorplanning of the PEs with several voltage islands. Experimental results using benchmark data study the effect of several parameters on the outcome of the heuristic. It is evident from the results that power consumption can be significantly reduced using our algorithm without significant area overhead. The area obtained from the heuristic is also compared with the optimal, and found to be within 4% of the optimal on average, when area minimization is given the priority.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457124","","Computer science;Cost function;Energy consumption;Informatics;Minimization;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Systems engineering and theory;Very large scale integration;Voltage","integrated circuit layout;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","cost function;floorplanning perspective;greedy heuristic;physical design perspective;power consumption;power efficient voltage islanding;processing elements;systems-on-chip","","0","","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the automotive industry has been developing the Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) to harness the reusability of common interfaces to communication buses, real-time operating systems and services. These common interfaces foster ease of adoption, interoperability, maintainability, predictability, and analyzability. However, realizing such standards also requires strong support from end-to-end design tool chains. In this paper, we describe some key analytical components that together characterize the end-to-end timing properties of hierarchical bus structures composed of FlexRay, CANbus and LINbus. Our analysis shows that the practical constraints imposed by standards such as AUTOSAR can lead to higher levels of schedulable resource utilization. This reduces both the overall component count and cost, while facilitating easy enhancements. Our analytical results show (a) how a schedulable utilization of 100% can be obtained for time-triggered FlexRay static segments under AUTOSAR compliance, (b) average-case schedulable utilization of 87% for the event-triggered CAN bus, and (c) similarities between LINbus and FlexRay analyses. We generalize the analytical results from different bus technologies, by exploiting their common underlying structure to enable an integrated end-to-end timing analysis of hierarchical heterogeneous networks. These together yield an end-to-end framework to analyze heterogeneously networked AUTOSAR-compliant automotive systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457184","","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Communication industry;Communication system control;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Embedded software;Embedded system;Job shop scheduling;Timing","automobile industry;automotive electronics;embedded systems;field buses","CANbus;FlexRay;LINbus;automobile;automotive embedded system;automotive industry;automotive open system architecture;average-case schedulable utilization;common interface reusability;communication bus;electronic control unit;embedded software function;end-to-end design tool chain;end-to-end timing property;event-triggered CAN bus;hierarchical bus structure;hierarchical heterogeneous network;networked AUTOSAR-compliant system;real-time operating system;schedulable resource utilization","","5","","12","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the growing complexity of SoC architectures full system simulations (HW+SW) become a bottleneck reducing this benefit. Hence, it is necessary to develop modeling styles which allow for further abstraction beyond the currently applied TLM methodology. This paper introduces such a modeling style, referred to as TLM+. It enables a higher modeling abstraction through merging hardware dependent driver software at the lowest level with the HW interface. Thus, sequences of HW transactions can be merged to single HW/SW transactions while preserving both the HW architecture and the low-level to high-level SW interfaces. In order to maintain the ability to validate timing-critical paths, a new resource model concept is introduced which compensates the loss of timing information, induced by merging HW transactions.

Streams often have throughput requirements. These jobs are implemented on a multiprocessor system as a task graph. Tasks communicate data over buffers, where tasks wait on sufficient space in output buffers before producing their data. For cost reasons, jobs share resources. Because jobs can share resources with other jobs that include tasks with date-dependent execution rates, we assume run-time scheduling on shared resources. Budget schedulers are applied, because they guarantee a minimum budget in a maximum replenishment interval. Both the buffer sizes as well as the budgets influence the temporal behaviour of a job. Interestingly, a trade-off exists: a larger buffer size can allow for a smaller budget while still meeting the throughput requirement. This work is the first to address the simultaneous computation of budget and buffer sizes.We solve this non-linear problem by formulating it as a second-order cone program.

In this paper we illustrate different aspects of using analogue line models as a transmission method for transactions between TLM models.

Transistor switches are simple, but have fundamental limitations in their effectiveness. MEMS switches, with zero leakage in the off state, have achieved much focus over the past decade in the RF field, but have only very recently been explored in the context of power gating. In this paper we study both methods in conjunction with voltage scaling and show that MEMS switches are the superior choice over a wide range of target throughputs, especially low-throughput applications such as wireless sensor networks and biomedical implants. We also show that the architectural choices and operating conditions in a throughput-aware design can be profoundly different when using MEMS switches as opposed to transistor switches. For instance, while transistor switches favor smaller and slower architectures, the MEMS switches favor larger and faster designs when the target throughput is low. Moreover, while the optimal operating voltage of a transistor-switched design resides in the subthreshold region, that of a MEMS-switched design can be above or near the threshold voltage.

Sci. & Eng., Univ. of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2010","20100429","2010","","","363","368","The pipelined Multiprocessor System on Chip (MPSoC) paradigm is well suited to the data flow nature of streaming applications. A pipelined MPSoC is a system where processing elements (PEs) are connected in a pipeline. Each PE is implemented using one of a number of processor configurations (configurations differ by instruction sets and cache sizes) available for that PE. The goal is to select a pipelined MPSoC with a mapping of a processor configuration to every PE. To estimate the run-time of a pipelined MPSoC, designers typically perform cycle-accurate simulation of the whole pipelined system. Since the number of possible pipelined implementations can be in the order of billions, estimation methods are necessary. In this paper, we propose two methods to estimate the runtime of a pipelined MPSoC, minimizing the use of slow cycle-accurate simulations. The first method estimates the runtime of the pipelined MPSoC, by performing cycle accurate simulations of individual processor configurations (rather than the whole pipelined system), and then utilizing an analytical model to estimate the runtime of the pipelined system. In the second method, runtimes of individual processor configurations are estimated using an analytical processor model (which uses cycle-accurate simulations of selected configurations, and an equation based on ISA and cache statistics). These estimated runtimes of individual processor configurations are then used to estimate the total runtime of the pipelined system. By evaluating our approach on three benchmarks, we show that the maximum estimation error is 5.91% and 16.45%, with an average estimation error of 2.28% and 6.30% for the first and second method respectively. The time to simulate all the possible pipelined implementations (design points) using cycle-accurate simulator is in the order of years, as design spaces with at least 10<sup>10</sup> design points are considered in this paper. However, the time to simulate all processor configura- ions individually (first method) takes tens of hours, while the time to simulate a subset of processor configurations and estimate their runtimes (second method) is only a few hours. Once these simulations are done, the runtime of each pipelined implementation can be estimated within milliseconds.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457178","","Analytical models;Application specific processors;Equations;Estimation error;Instruction sets;Multiprocessing systems;Pipelines;Runtime;Space exploration;Statistical analysis","multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;system-on-chip","average estimation error;cycle-accurate simulation;cycle-accurate simulator;data flow nature;maximum estimation error;pipelined MPSoC;pipelined multiprocessor system on chip;processing elements;processor configurations;rapid runtime estimation methods;streaming applications","","6","","20","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A regression model is developed to obtain the estimates from previously observed data. To improve the quality of the estimates execution times of predecessor task in a software pipeline is exploited. Since the Model order (number of past observations required to obtain optimal estimate) cannot be determined at design time and to circumvent this, we propose means to dynamically update the order and hence obtain a critical-fit model without resorting to analytical benchmarking or calibration runs. The estimation scheme comprises of two estimation methods, namely `Wiener-Hopf' and Order-recursive estimation. The selection of the estimation method is automatic and depends on the required quality of the estimate against a user selectable threshold. In order recursion, new model order is obtained in conjunction to estimates, so order recursion solve the system both for order and estimate simultaneously. We experimented on two multicore platforms using H.264 decoder, a control dominant, computationally demanding application. Results show that estimates obtained by our method are up to 39% better in case of the first task in the software pipeline. The estimate quality improves significantly for the task with predecessor(s) in pipeline and comparison shows up to 54% improvement in estimation results.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456912","","Application software;Automatic control;Calibration;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Decoding;Multicore processing;Pipelines;Recursive estimation;Software quality","pipeline processing;program control structures;regression analysis","RMOT;Wiener-Hopf;analytical benchmarking;application structure;recursion in model order for task execution time estimation;recursive estimation;regression model;software pipeline;underlying architecture","","0","","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The datapath in a typical design is composed of different kinds of components, including functional units, registers and multiplexers. To optimize the overall resource usage, a behavioral synthesis tool should consider all kinds of components at the same time. However, most previous work on behavioral synthesis has the limitations of (i) not being able to consider all kinds of resources globally, and/or (ii) separating the synthesis process into a sequence of optimization steps without a consistent optimization objective. In this paper we present a behavioral synthesis flow in which all types of components in the datapath are modeled and optimized consistently. The key idea is to feed to the scheduler the intentions for sharing functional units and registers in favor of the global optimization goal (such as total area), so that the scheduler could generate a schedule that makes the sharing intentions feasible. Experiments show that compared to the solution of minimizing functional unit requirements in scheduling and using the least number of functional units and registers in binding, our solution achieves a 24% reduction in total area; compared to the online tool provided by c-to-verilog.com, our solution achieves a 30% reduction on average.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457001","","Computer science;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Feeds;High level synthesis;Job shop scheduling;Multiplexing;Productivity;Resource management;Temperature","high level synthesis;optimisation;resource allocation","behavioral synthesis tool;coordinated resource optimization;datapath;functional units;global optimization goal;multiplexers;registers;resource usage reduction;scheduler","","5","","26","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a major drawback of TCAM-based IP lookup schemes lies in their high power consumption. Thus, the rapid increase of routing tables inevitably deteriorates TCAM power efficiency. Although on-chip TCAM minimizers aim for the TCAM power efficiency in a fast time and at a small memory amount, the minimizers are not efficient in a large scale prefix table. In this paper, we present a hash-based on-chip TCAM minimization for a power- and throughput-efficient IP lookup. In a hash-based TCAM minimization (HTM), we convert prefixes into keys and merge keys with a fast hash lookup in an O(nW) complexity, where n is the number of prefixes and W is the number of IP bits. Additionally, by building a forest of merging trees and choosing a subset among them, we can achieve a higher minimization ratio. The simulation with two routing tables shows that our HPM scheme uses 8.6 and 4.0 times fewer computation time and memory, compared to a contemporary on-chip minimizer.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456921","","Associative memory;Costs;Energy consumption;Hardware;Logic;Minimization methods;Random access memory;Routing;Transistors;Workstations","IP networks;microprocessor chips;network routing","IP lookup;high power consumption;high speed routers;memory-and time-efficient onchip TCAM Minimizer;ternary content addressable memories","","4","","20","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a multivariate regression based technique that computes the propagation delay of circuits subject to manufacturing process variations in the presence of temporal variations like temperature. It can be used to predict the dynamic behavior of circuits under changing operating conditions. The median error between the proposed model and circuit-level simulations is below 5%.

Traditional redundancy techniques are expensive for designing energy-efficient systems that are resilient to high error rates. We present Error Resilient System Architecture (ERSA), a low-cost robust system architecture for emerging killer probabilistic applications such as Recognition, Mining and Synthesis (RMS) applications. While resilience of such applications to errors in low-order bits of data is well-known, execution of such applications on error-prone hardware significantly degrades output quality (due to high-order bit errors and crashes). ERSA achieves high error resilience to high-order bit errors and control errors (in addition to low-order bit errors) using a judicious combination of 3 key ideas: (1) asymmetric reliability in many-core architectures, (2) error-resilient algorithms at the core of probabilistic applications, and (3) intelligent software optimizations. Error injection experiments on a multi-core ERSA hardware prototype demonstrate that, even at very high error rates of 20,000 errors/second/core or 2??10<sup>-4</sup> error/cycle/core (with errors injected in architecturally-visible registers), ERSA maintains 90% or better accuracy of output results, together with minimal impact on execution time, for probabilistic applications such as K-Means clustering, LDPC decoding and Bayesian networks. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ERSA in tolerating high rates of static memory errors that are characteristic of emerging challenges such as Vccmin problems and erratic bit errors. Using the concept of configurable reliability, ERSA platforms may also be adapted for general-purpose applications that are less resilient to errors (but at higher costs).","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457059","","Computer architecture;Control system synthesis;Degradation;Energy efficiency;Error analysis;Error correction;Hardware;Redundancy;Resilience;Robustness","belief networks;data mining;hardware-software codesign;optimisation;pattern clustering;probability;reliability theory","Bayesian networks;ERSA;K-means clustering;LDPC decoding;RMS;asymmetric reliability;error resilient system architecture;intelligent software optimizations;probabilistic applications;recognition mining and synthesis;redundancy techniques","","44","","28","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the contrary, an explicit exchange of synchronization tokens among the processing elements through dedicated on-chip links would be beneficial for the overall system performance. In this paper we propose the Medea NoC-based framework, a hybrid shared-memory/message-passing approach. Medea has been modeled with a fast, cycle-accurate SystemC implementation enabling a fast system exploration varying several parameters like number and types of cores, cache size and policy and NoC features.

We use the SNM as a measure of the cell stability during read operations, and Qcrit to quantify the robustness against SEE during hold mode. The techniques proposed have a low impact on read time and leakage current while improving significantly the SNM.

Significant improvements in this area can only be achieved through disruptive innovations and new system approaches, which rely on a combination of excellent research & development and world leading know-how of semiconductor production. But will hardware be the driver to fulfill these requirements and software has to adapt to whatever hardware concepts are developed?

An approach to reduce the verification effort, is to perform composability analysis which has been studied for sets of applications modeled as Synchronous Dataflow Graphs. In this paper we introduce a framework that supports a more general parallel programming model based on the Kahn Process Networks Model of Computation and integrates a complete MPSoC programming environment that includes: compiler-centric analysis, performance estimation, simulation as well as mapping and scheduling of multiple applications.

Mapping of logical time to physical time is achieved by a Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT) analyser. To improve throughput while maintaining predictability, a hardware accelerator specifically designed for PRET-C is added to a soft-core processor.

The partitioning algorithm performs bottom-up clustering of the internal logic of a given IP core to divide it into smaller ones, each of which has no combinational path from input to output and thus is legal for LI-interface encapsulation. Applying this algorithm to cores on critical feedback loops optimizes their length and in turn enables throughput optimization via the subsequent floorplanning. The merging algorithm reduces the number of cores on non-critical loops, lowering the overall area taken by LI interfaces without hurting the system throughput. Experimental results on a large system-on-chip design show a 16.7% speedup in system throughput and a 2.1% reduction in area occupation.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457005","","Clustering algorithms;Encapsulation;Feedback loop;Iterative algorithms;Law;Legal factors;Logic;Merging;Partitioning algorithms;Throughput","circuit layout;encapsulation;optimisation;system-on-chip","IP core;LI interface encapsulation;bottom up clustering;iterative physical synthesis flow;latency insensitive systems;local logic structures;multicore SoC floorplanning optimization;throughput driven partitioning algorithm;throughput preserving merging algorithm","","0","","29","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this work is to combine the timing-robustness of delay-insensitive (i.e., unordered) codes with the fault-tolerance of error-correcting codes. The proposed error-correcting unordered (ECU) code, called Zero-Sum, can safely accommodate arbitrary skew in arrival times of individual bits in a packet, while simultaneously providing 1-bit correction and 2-bit detection. A systematic code is targeted, where data can be directly extracted from the codewords. A basic method for generating the code is presented, as well as detailed designs for the supporting hardware blocks. An outline of the system micro-architecture and its operating protocol is also given. When compared to the best previous systematic ECU code, the new code provides a 5.74 to 18.18% reduction in transition power for most field sizes, with better or comparable coding efficiency. Pre-layout technology-mapped implementations of the supporting hardware (encoder, completion detector, error-corrector) were synthesized with the UC Berkeley ABC tool using a 90nm industrial standard cell library.

Quantitatively characterizing the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults at early design stage is significantly helpful to balance system performance and reliability. Prior researches have proposed several metrics to characterize the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to soft errors and permanent faults, however, the vulnerability of these structures to intermittent faults are still rarely considered. In this work, we propose a metric intermittent vulnerability factor (IVF) to characterize the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults. A structure's IVF is the probability an intermittent fault in that structure causes an external visible error. We instrument a cycle-accurate execution-driven simulator Sim-Alpha to compute IVFs for reorder buffer and register file. Experimental results show that the IVF of reorder buffer is much higher than that of register file. Besides, IVF varies significantly across different structures and workloads, which implies partial protection to the most vulnerable structures to improve system reliability with less overhead.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457206","","CMOS process;Computational modeling;In vitro fertilization;Instruments;Manufacturing processes;Microprocessors;Protection;Registers;Reliability;System performance","circuit simulation;fault simulation;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips","CMOS manufacturing process;Sim-Alpha simulator;cycle-accurate execution-driven simulator;intermittent fault;metric intermittent vulnerability factor;microprocessor structure vulnerability;nano-scale;register file;reorder buffer;soft error;system performance;system reliability","","4","","22","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current high performance routers depend on proprietary hardware solutions, which make it difficult to adapt to ever-changing network protocols. On the other hand, software routers offer the best flexibility and programmability, but could only achieve a throughput one order of magnitude lower. Modern GPUs are offering significant computing power, and its data-parallel computing model well matches the typical patterns of packet processing on routers. Accordingly, in this research we investigate the potential of CUDA-enabled GPUs for IP routing applications. As a first step toward exploring the architecture of a GPU based software router, we developed GPU solutions for a series of core IP routing applications such as IP routing table lookup and pattern match. For the deep packet inspection application, we implemented both a Bloom-filter based string matching algorithm and a finite automata based regular expression matching algorithm. A GPU based routing table lookup solution is also proposed in this work. Experimental results proved that GPU could accelerate the routing processing by one order of magnitude. Our work suggests that, with proper architectural modifications, GPU based software routers could deliver significant higher throughput than previous CPU based solutions.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457229","Bloom filter;CUDA;DFA;Deep packet inspection;GPU;router;table lookup","Application software;Computer architecture;Graphics;Hardware;Inspection;Pattern matching;Protocols;Routing;Table lookup;Throughput","IP networks;routing protocols;string matching;table lookup;telecommunication network routing","Bloom filter;IP routing processing;IP routing table lookup;data-parallel computing model;graphic processors;hardware solutions;packet inspection application;packet processing;pattern matching;software routers;string matching algorithm;toward","","7","","39","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless multimedia terminals are among the key drivers for MPSoC platform evolution. Heterogeneous multi-processor architectures achieve high performance and can lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption for this class of applications. However, just designing energy efficient hardware is not enough. Programming models and tools for efficient MPSoC programming are equally important to ensure optimum platform utilization. Unfortunately, this discipline is still in its infancy, which endangers the return on investment for MPSoC architecture designs. On one hand there is a need for maintaining and gradually porting a large amount of legacy code to MPSoCs. On the other hand, special C language extensions for parallel programming as well as adapted process network programming models provide a great opportunity to completely rethink the traditional sequential programming paradigm for sake of higher efficiency and productivity. MPSoC programming is more than just code parallelisation, though. Besides energy efficiency, limited and specialized processing resources, and real-time constraints also growing software complexity and mapping of simultaneous applications need to be taken into account. We analyze the programming methodology requirements for heterogeneous MPSoC platforms and outline new approaches.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457047","","Application software;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Parallel programming;Productivity;Software debugging;Software maintenance;Software tools","C language;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;real-time systems;software metrics;system-on-chip","C language extensions;cool MPSoC programming;multicore system-on-chip;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network programming models;parallel programming;programming models;real-time constraints;sequential programming;software complexity;wireless multimedia terminals","","1","","20","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is becoming increasingly evident that sampling based methods for variation-aware extraction are more efficient than more computationally complex techniques such as stochastic Galerkin method or the Neumann expansion. However, one of the remaining computational challenges of sampling based methods is how to simultaneously and efficiently solve the large number of linear systems corresponding to each different sample point. In this paper, we present a stochastic model reduction technique that exploits the similarity among the different solves to reduce the computational complexity of subsequent solves. We first suggest how to build a projection matrix such that the statistical moments and/or the coefficients of the projection of the stochastic vector on some orthogonal polynomials are preserved.We further introduce a proximity measure, which we use to determine apriori if a given system needs to be solved, or if it is instead properly represented using the currently available basis. Finally, in order to reduce the time required for the system assembly, we use the multivariate Hermite expansion to represent the system matrix. We verify our method by solving a variety of variation-aware capacitance extraction problems ranging from on-chip capacitance extraction in the presence of width and thickness variations, to off-chip capacitance extraction in the presence of surface roughness. We further solve very large scale problems that cannot be handled by any other state of the art technique.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457161","","Capacitance;Computational complexity;Current measurement;Linear systems;Moment methods;Polynomials;Reduced order systems;Sampling methods;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems","Galerkin method;algebra;computational complexity;integrated circuit interconnections;polynomials;stochastic processes;surface roughness","Neumann expansion;computational complexity;multivariate Hermite expansion;off-chip capacitance extraction;on-chip capacitance extraction;orthogonal polynomials;statistical moment preserving model order reduction;statistical moments;stochastic Galerkin method;stochastic model order reduction technique;stochastic model reduction technique;surface roughness;variation-aware capacitance extraction problems;variation-aware extraction;variation-aware interconnect extraction","","3","","14","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, it is not energy-efficient to adjust the coolant flow rate based on the worst-case conditions, as this would cause an excess in pump power. For energy-efficient cooling, we propose a novel controller to adjust the liquid flow rate to meet the desired temperature and to minimize pump energy consumption. Our technique also includes a job scheduler, which balances the temperature across the system to maximize cooling efficiency and to improve reliability.

Prior work focuses on homogeneous cores with symmetric performance and optimizes on-chip communication only. However, core-to-core performance asymmetry due to manufacturing process variations poses new challenges for constructing virtual topologies. Lower performance cores may scatter over a virtual topology, while operating systems typically allocate tasks to continuous cores. As a result, parallel applications are probably assigned to a region containing many slower cores that become bottlenecks. To tackle the above problem, in this paper we present a novel performance-asymmetry-aware reconfiguration algorithm Bubble-Up based on a new metric called core fragmentation factor (CFF). Bubble-Up can arrange cores with similar performance closer, yet maintaining reasonable hop distances between virtual neighbors, thus accelerating applications with higher degree of parallelism, without changing existing allocation strategies for OS.

Therefore, current intrusive debugging methodologies for sequential programs cannot be used directly in parallel programs in a multicore environment. This work developed a non-intrusive run-time assertion (RunAssert) for parallel program development based on a novel non-uniform debugging architecture. Our approaches are as follows: (a) a current language extension for parallel program debugging (b) corresponding non-intrusive hardware configuration logic and checking methodologies and (c) several reality cases using the extensions mentioned above. In general, the target program can be executed at its original speed without altering the parallel sequences, thereby eliminating the possibility of probe effect.

We propose a new adaptive cache replacement policy, called Dueling CLOCK (DC), that has several advantages over the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policy. LRU's strength is that it keeps track of the 'recency' information of memory accesses. However, a) LRU has a high overhead cost of moving cache blocks into the most recently used position each time a cache block is accessed; b) LRU does not exploit 'frequency' information of memory accesses; and, c) LRU is prone to cache pollution when a sequence of single-use memory accesses that are larger than the cache size is fetched from memory (i.e., it is non scan resistant). The DC policy was developed to have low overhead cost, to capture 'recency' information in memory accesses, to exploit the 'frequency' pattern of memory accesses and to be scan resistant. In this paper, we propose a hardware implementation of the CLOCK algorithm for use within an on-chip cache controller to ensure low overhead cost. We then present the DC policy, which is an adaptive replacement policy that alternates between the CLOCK algorithm and the scan resistant version of the CLOCK algorithm. We present experimental results showing the MPKI (Misses per thousand instructions) comparison of DC against existing replacement policies, such as LRU. The results for an 8-way 1MB L2 cache show that DC can lower the MPKI of SPEC CPU2000 benchmark by an average of 10.6% when compared to the tree based Pseudo-LRU cache replacement policy.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456920","","Australia;Clocks;Computer science;Costs;DC generators;Delay;Engineering management;Frequency;Hardware;Pollution","cache storage;storage management chips","CLOCK algorithm;SPEC CPU2000 benchmark;adaptive cache replacement policy;dueling CLOCK;least recently used cache replacement policy;misses per thousand instructions;on-chip L2 cache management;single use memory accesses","","2","","20","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate the effect of decreased reliability, a number of fault-tolerant architectures have been proposed that exploit the natural coarse-grained redundancy available in chip multiprocessors (CMPs). These architectures execute a single application using two threads, typically as one leading thread and one trailing thread. Errors are detected by comparing the outputs produced by these two threads. These architectures schedule a single application on two cores or two thread contexts of a CMP. As a result, besides the additional energy consumption and performance overhead that is required to provide fault tolerance, such schemes also impose a throughput loss. Consequently a CMP which is capable of executing 2n threads in non-redundant mode can only execute half as many (n) threads in fault-tolerant mode. In this paper we propose multiplexed redundant execution (MRE), a low-overhead architectural technique that executes multiple trailing threads on a single processor core. MRE exploits the observation that it is possible to accelerate the execution of the trailing thread by providing execution assistance from the leading thread.

Performance optimization on SPM based processors requires effective schemes for software based management of code and/or data overlay. In the context of our problem instance the code overlay scheme impacts both the stream element to core mapping and memory available for inter-processor communication. The paper presents an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation and heuristic approach that effectively exploit the SPM to maximize the throughput of stream programs when mapped to multicore processors.

Different from many previous results, this paper explores leakage-aware energy-efficient scheduling if leakage power consumption depends on temperature. We propose a pattern-based approach which divides a given time horizon into several time segments with the same length, where the processor is in the active (dormant, respectively) mode for a fixed amount of time at the beginning (end, respectively) of each time segment. Computation is advanced in the active mode, whereas the dormant mode helps reduce the temperature via cooling as well as the leakage power consumption. Since the pattern-based approach leads to a steady state with an equilibrium temperature, we develop a procedure to find the optimal pattern whose energy consumption in steady state is the minimum. Compared to existing work, our approach is more effective, has less run-time scheduling overhead, and requires only a simple scheduler to control the system mode periodically.

In order to further reduce subthreshold leakage power consumption, in this paper, we ingeniously combine dual voltage assignment technique with intended clock skew scheduling: First, a leakage weight based clock skew scheduling algorithm is proposed to enlarge the leakage power optimization potential. Then we employ a dual-threshold voltage assignment algorithm to minimize leakage power. The experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show that, within only several seconds, the leakage power can be further reduced by as much as 41.30% and by 9.87% on average with this new approach, compared to using the traditional method without considering clock skews.

These devices are networked by an underlying infrastructure, which provides bias currents to sensing devices and collects measurements. In this work, we address the optimization of the bias current distribution network utilized by the sensing devices. We show that the choice between two fundamental topologies (the 2-wire and the 4-wire measurement) for this network has a non-negligible impact on the precision of the monitoring system. We also show that the 4-wire measurement principle supports the remote sensing technique better. However, it requires more routing resources. We thus propose a novel routing algorithm to minimize its routing cost. We also present a detailed evaluation of the quality of the resulting system in presence of process and thermal variations. Our Monte Carlo simulations using the IBM 10SF 65 nm SPICE models show that the monitoring accuracies can be as high as 0.6??C under considerable amount of process and temperature variation. Moreover, by adopting a customized routing approach for the current mirror network, the total wire length of the bias current network can be reduced by as much as 42.74% and by 27.65% on average.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457023","","Costs;Current distribution;Current measurement;Microprocessor chips;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Remote monitoring;Routing;SPICE;Semiconductor device measurement","Monte Carlo methods;SPICE;distribution networks;microprocessor chips;optimisation;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","4-wire measurement principle;IBM 10SF SPICE models;Monte Carlo simulations;bias current distribution network;microprocessor chips;on-chip thermal monitoring;optimization;remote sensing;routing resources;size 65 nm;thermal sensing devices","","0","","13","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose scratch-pad memory management techniques for priority-based preemptive multi-task systems. Our techniques are applicable to a real-time environment. The three methods which we propose, i.e., spatial, temporal, and hybrid methods, bring about effective usage of the scratch-pad memory space, and achieve energy reduction in the instruction memory subsystems. We formulate each method as an integer programming problem that simultaneously determines (1) partitioning of scratch-pad memory space for the tasks, and (2) allocation of program code to scratch-pad memory space for each task. It is remarkable that periods and priorities of tasks are considered in the formulas. Additionally, we implement an RTOS-hardware cooperative support mechanism for a runtime code allocation to the scratch-pad memory space. We have made the experiments with the fully functional real-time operating system. The experimental results with four task sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our techniques. Up to 73% energy reduction compared to a standard method was achieved.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456977","","Cache memory;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Information science;Linear programming;Operating systems;Real time systems;Scanning probe microscopy;Switches","cache storage;embedded systems;multiprogramming;storage management","RTOS-hardware cooperative support mechanism;cache memory;embedded systems;integer programming problem;priority-based preemptive multi-task systems;real-time operating system;runtime code allocation;scratch-pad memory allocation;scratch-pad memory management techniques;scratch-pad memory partitioning","","13","","22","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, these issues are studied and a control variate-base technique is developed to accurately estimate the moments of circuits' critical delays with very few timing simulation iterations. A skew-normal distribution is then used to form a closed-form cumulative distribution function of timing yield.

In this article, we prove that Correlation-based on ElectroMagnetic Analysis (CEMA) on a hardware-based high-performance AES module is possible from a distance as far as 50 cm. First we show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to a non-zero limit when moving the antenna away from the cryptographic device. An analysis of the leakage structure shows that the Hamming distance model, although suitable for small distances gets more and more distorted when the antenna is displaced far from the device. As we cannot devise any physical model that would predict the observations, we instead pre-characterized it using a first order templates construction. With this model, we enhanced the CEMA by a factor up to ten. Therefore, we conclude that EMA at large distance is feasible with our amplification strategy coupled to an innovative training phase aiming at precharacterizing accurate coefficients of a parametric weighted distance leakage model.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456906","Correlation EMA (CEMA);ElectroMagnetic Analysis (EMA);Leakage model;Side-Channel Attacks (SCA);Template estimation","Clocks;Cryptography;Dissolved gas analysis;Electromagnetic analysis;Electromagnetic radiation;Hardware;Plastics;Power supplies;Signal to noise ratio;Telecommunications","correlation theory;cryptography","CEMA;Hamming distance model;SNR;correlation based on electromagnetic analysis;cryptographic devices;far correlation based EMA;precharacterized leakage model;signal-to-noise ratio","","0","","9","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An efficient transistor-level piecewise-linear macromodeling approach for model order reduction of nonlinear circuits","Xiaoda Pan; Fan Yang; Xuan Zeng; Yangfeng Su","Microelectron.

The trajectory piecewise-linear macromodeling technique linearizes nonlinear circuits around multiple expansion points which are extracted from state trajectories driven by training inputs. However, the accuracy of the trajectory piecewise-linear macromodeling technique heavily relies on the extracted expansion points and the training inputs. It will lead to large error in simulation if state vector reaches regions far away from the extracted expansion points. In this paper, we propose an efficient transistor-level piecewise linearization scheme for macromodeling of nonlinear circuits. Piecewise linear models are first built for each transistor. The macromodel of the whole nonlinear circuit is then constructed by combining all the piecewise-linear models of the transistors together with appropriate weight functions. The proposed approach can cover remarkably larger state space than the TPWL method. By using the complete piecewise-linear models of the transistors, the constructed piecewise-linear models of the nonlinear circuits are capable of covering the whole state space of the nonlinear circuits. More importantly, model order reduction of the proposed transistor-level piecewise linearization macromodel is also possible, which makes the proposed method a potentially good macromodeling approach for model order reduction of nonlinear circuits.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457083","","Circuit simulation;Educational technology;Nonlinear circuits;Nonlinear systems;Piecewise linear approximation;Piecewise linear techniques;Polynomials;Reduced order systems;State-space methods;Trajectory","circuit simulation;linearisation techniques;piecewise linear techniques;reduced order systems;transistor circuits","model order reduction;nonlinear circuit macromodeling;nonlinear circuits;training input;trajectory piecewise linear macromodeling technique;transistor level piecewise linear macromodeling;transistor level piecewise linearization","","1","","8","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we review the efficacy of four leading write-assist (WA) techniques and their behavior at lower supply voltages in commercial SRAMs from 65nm, 45nm and 32nm low power technology nodes. In particular, the word-line boosting and negative bit-line WA techniques seem most promising at lower voltages. These two techniques help reduce the value of WL<sub>crit</sub> by a factor of ~2.5X at 0.7V and also decrease the 3?? spread by ~3.3X, thus significantly reducing the impact of process variations. These write-assist techniques also impact the dynamic read noise margin (DRNM) of half-selected cells during the write operation. The negative bit-line WA technique has virtually no impact on the DRNM but all other WA techniques degrade the DRNM by 10-15%. In conjunction with the benefit (decrease in WL<sub>crit</sub>) and the negative impact (decrease in DRNM), overhead of implementation in terms of area and performance must be analyzed to choose the best write-assist technique for lowering the SRAM V<sub>min</sub>.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457179","","Boosting;Degradation;Dynamic voltage scaling;Low voltage;Performance analysis;Pulse measurements;Random access memory;Research and development;SRAM chips;Space vector pulse width modulation","SRAM chips;low-power electronics","SRAM;dynamic read noise margin;low power technology;low voltage nanoscale;minimum operating voltage;negative bit-line WA techniques;read and write assist techniques;size 32 nm;size 45 nm;size 65 nm;word-line boosting;write-assist techniques","","15","3","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If a permanent fault was detected, this fault is masked for the rest of the program execution such that no further time is needed for recovering from that fault. The proposed extensions were implemented in the data path of a simple VLIW processor in order to prove the feasibility and to determine the hardware overhead.

The concept of Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) is well adapted to enable hardware reuse between products and between multiple wireless standards in the same device. Heterogeneous architectures are well known solutions but they have limited flexibility.

This platform is built with Smart ModEm Processors (SMEP) interconnected with a Network-on-Chip. The SMEP, implemented in 65nm low-power CMOS, can perform 3.2 GMAC/s with 77 GBits/s internal bandwidth at 400MHz.

Leading edge CMOS technologies today are unique examples of nanoscale engineering at an industrial scale. As we celebrate this remarkable achievement of our industry that forms the ever-expanding technology basis of modern society we cannot help but ponder the question of how we can continue to push the envelope of nano-electronics. With the end of Si FET scaling appearing increasingly near, searching for more scalable transistor structures in Si and in ??beyond-Si?? solutions has become imperative; from relatively ??easy?? transitions to non-planar Si structures, to the incorporation of high mobility semiconductors, like Ge and III-V's, to even higher mobility new materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, or other molecular structures. And even further, there are searches for new information representation and processing concepts beyond charge in FETs, as for example, in spin-state devices. Of course, declaring silicon dead is premature at best, and with this in mind I will discuss the challenges and possible scenaria for the introduction of novel nano-electronic devices.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457026","","CMOS technology;Carbon nanotubes;FETs;III-V semiconductor materials;Information representation;Nanoelectronics;Nanoscale devices;Organic materials;Semiconductor materials;Silicon","CMOS integrated circuits;elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;nanoelectronics;silicon","CMOS technologies;Si;Si FET scaling;carbon nanotubes;graphene;high mobility semiconductors;molecular structures;nanoelectronic devices;nanoscale engineering;scalable transistor structures;spin-state devices","","0","","","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, an intelligent selection of encoding methods is achieved through a REasoning And Learning (REAL) framework at run-time. An instance of PRESSNoC was implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA device, which required 25.5% lesser number of slices compared to a conventional NoC with a full-fledged encoding method. The average benefit to overhead ratio of the proposed architecture is greater than that of a conventional NoC by 71%, 32%, and 277% when we consider the individual effects of interference rate per instruction, application domains, and system characteristics, respectively.

Simulations must now rely on scalable performance of multi-core systems rather than faster clock frequencies. Novel parallelization techniques are needed to satisfy the industrial simulation demands that are essential for the development of safety-critical systems. Simulink formalism is the industrial de facto standard, but current state-of-the-art simulation and code generation techniques fail to fully exploit the parallelism in modern multi-core systems. However, closed-loop and dynamic system simulations are very difficult to parallelize because of the loop-carried dependencies. In this paper we introduce a novel skewed pipelining technique that overcomes these difficulties and allows loop-carried Simulink applications to be executed concurrently in multi-core systems. By delaying the forwarding of values for a few iterations, we can break some data dependencies and coarsen the granularity of programs. This improves the concurrency and reduces the high cost of inter-processor communication. Implementation studies to demonstrate the viability of our method on a commodity multi-core system with 2, 3, and 4 processors show a 1.72, 2.38, and 3.33 fold speedup over uniprocessor execution.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456927","","Aerodynamics;Aerospace industry;Aerospace simulation;Automotive engineering;Clocks;Code standards;Delay systems;Frequency;Pipeline processing;Vehicle dynamics","closed loop systems;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;pipeline processing;program compilers;safety-critical software","Simulink formalism;aerospace embedded applications;automotive embedded applications;clock frequencies;closed loop systems;code generation techniques;industrial simulation;interprocessor communication;multicore systems;parallel simulink simulations;parallelization techniques;safety critical systems;skewed pipelining","","1","","16","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

AC is composed of heterogeneous sub-caches as opposed to common caches using homogenous sub-caches. The sub-caches are turned off depending on the application workload to conserve power and minimize latencies. A novel reconfiguration algorithm based on Basic Block Vectors is proposed to recognize program phases, and a learning mechanism is used to select the appropriate cache configuration for each program phase. We compare our reconfigurable cache with existing proposals of adaptive and non-adaptive caches. Our results show that the combination of AC and the novel reconfiguration algorithm provides the best power consumption and performance.

To address this problem, we propose a tool BACH 2 that adopts a path-oriented method for bounded reachability analysis of compositional linear hybrid systems. For each component, a path is selected and all selected paths compose a path set for reachability analysis. Each path is independently encoded to a set of constraints while synchronization controls are encoded as a set of constraints too. By merging all the constraints into one set, the path-oriented reachability problem of a path set can be transformed to the feasibility problem of this resulting linear constraint set, which can be solved by linear programming efficiently. Based on this path-oriented method, BACH 2 adopts a shared label sequence guided depth first search (SLS-DFS) method to perform bounded reachability analysis of compositional linear hybrid system, where all potential path sets within the bound limit are identified and verified one by one. By this means, since only the structure of a system and the recently visited one path in each component need to be stored in memory, memory consumption of BACH 2 is very small at runtime. As a result, BACH 2 enables the verification of extremely large systems, as is demonstrated in our experiments.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457051","","Automata;Computer science;Encoding;Interleaved codes;Laboratories;Linear programming;Prototypes;Reachability analysis;Space exploration;Surface-mount technology","automata theory;formal verification;linear programming;reachability analysis;synchronisation;tree searching","BACH 2;bounded reachability checker;compositional linear hybrid systems;linear programming;path-oriented reachability problem;reachability analysis techniques;shared label sequence guided depth first search method;single linear hybrid automata;synchronization controls","","1","","13","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we implement an Integer Nonlinear Programming to select the most profitable data pages and employ Virtual Memory System to remap those data pages, which can cause severe Cache conflict within a time slot, to the on-chip Scratchpad Memory (SPM). In order to minimize the swapping overhead of dynamic SPM allocation, we introduce a novel SPM controller with a tightly coupled DMA to issue the swapping operations without CPU's intervention.

The controller is programmable where the DSM functions such as virtual-to-physical address translation, memory access and synchronization etc. are realized using microcode. To enable concurrent processing of memory requests from the local and remote cores, our controller features two mini-processors, one dealing with requests from the local core and the other from remote cores. Synthesis results suggest that the controller consumes 51k gates for the logic and can run up to 455 MHz in 130 nm technology. To evaluate its performance, we use synthetic and application workloads. Results show that, when the system size is scaled up, the delay overhead incurred by the controller may become less significant when compared with the network delay. In this way, the delay efficiency of our DSM solution is close to hardware solutions on average but still have all the flexibility of software solutions.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457240","","Network-on-a-chip","distributed shared memory systems;firmware;microcontrollers;network-on-chip","application workloads;distributed shared memory;dual microcoded controller;memory access;mini-processors;multi-core network-on-chips;network delay;virtual-to-physical address translation","","6","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the hardware layer in a secure system is compromised, not only it would be possible to extract secret information about the software, but it would also be extremely hard for the software to detect that an attack is underway. In this work we detail a complete end-to-end fault-attack on a microprocessor system and practically demonstrate how hardware vulnerabilities can be exploited to target secure systems. We developed a theoretical attack to the RSA signature algorithm, and we realized it in practice against an FPGA implementation of the system under attack. To perpetrate the attack, we inject transient faults in the target machine by regulating the voltage supply of the system. Thus, our attack does not require access to the victim system's internal components, but simply proximity to it. The paper makes three important contributions: first, we develop a systematic fault-based attack on the modular exponentiation algorithm for RSA. Second, we expose and exploit a severe flaw on the implementation of the RSA signature algorithm on OpenSSL, a widely used package for SSL encryption and authentication. Third, we report on the first physical demonstration of a fault-based security attack of a complete microprocessor system running unmodified production software: we attack the original OpenSSL authentication library running on a SPARC Linux system implemented on FPGA, and extract the system's 1024-bit RSA private key in approximately 100 hours.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456933","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data mining;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Microprocessors;Packaging;Production systems;Security;Voltage","field programmable gate arrays;public domain software;public key cryptography","FPGA implementation;RSA authentication;SSL encryption;end-to-end fault-attack;fault based attack;hardware layer;microprocessor system;secret information extraction","","7","2","15","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is critically important to develop datacenter-wide power and thermal management (PTM) solutions that improve the energy efficiency of the datacenters. This paper describes one such approach where a PTM engine decides on the number and placement of ON servers while simultaneously adjusting the supplied cold air temperature. The goal is to minimize the total power consumption (for both servers and air conditioning units) while meeting an upper bound on the maximum temperature seen in any server chassis in the data center. To achieve this goal, it is important to be able to predict the incoming workload in terms of requests per second (which is done by using a short-term workload forecasting technique) and to have efficient runtime policies for bringing new servers online when the workload is high or shutting them off when the workload is low. Datacenter-wide power saving is thus achieved by a combination of chassis consolidation and efficient cooling.

A wall-mounted Time-Of-Flight camera provides accurate measurements of the acquired scene in all illumination conditions, allowing the reliable detection of critical events. Preliminarily, an off-line calibration procedure estimates the external camera parameters automatically without landmarks, calibration patterns or user intervention. The calibration procedure searches for different planes in the scene selecting the one that accomplishes the floor plane constraints. Subsequently, the moving regions are detected in real-time by applying a Bayesian segmentation to the whole 3D points cloud. The distance of the 3D human centroid from the floor plane is evaluated by using the previously defined calibration parameters and the corresponding trend is used as feature in a thresholding-based clustering for fall detection. The fall detection shows high performances in terms of efficiency and reliability on a large real dataset in which almost one half of events are falls acquired in different conditions. The posture recognition is carried out by using both the 3D human centroid distance from the floor plane and the orientation of the body spine estimated by applying a topological approach to the range images.

To match the application characteristics, customized irregular topologies and routing functions are used. With wormhole flow control and custom irregular NoC topologies, deadlocks can occur during system operation. Ensuring a deadlock free operation of custom NoCs is a major challenge. In this paper, we address this important issue and present a method to remove deadlocks in application-specific NoCs. Our method can be applied to any NoC topology and routing function, and the potential deadlocks are removed by adding minimal number of virtual or physical channels.

In HW/SW co-simulation, timing synchronization should be involved between the hardware and software simulations for keeping their concurrency. However, improperly handling timing synchronization either slows down the simulation speed or scarifies the simulation accuracy. Our approach performs timing synchronization only at the points of HW/SW interactions, so the accurate simulation result can be achieved efficiently. Furthermore, we define three abstraction levels of software TLM models based on the type of interactions captured. Given the target software, the software TLM models can be automatically generated in multiple abstraction layers. The experimental results show that our software TLM models attain 3 million instructions per second (MIPS) for low-level abstraction and go as high as 248 MIPS for higher level abstraction. Therefore, designers can have efficient co-simulation by selecting a proper layer according to the abstraction of corresponding hardware components.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456986","","Acceleration;Computational modeling;Computer industry;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Digital systems;Embedded software;Hardware;Software performance;Timing","digital simulation;digital systems;hardware-software codesign;synchronisation","HW-SW cosimulation;multiple abstraction layers;software transaction level modeling approach;timing synchronization","","4","","13","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The central learning machine is a defect filter that distinguishes failing devices due to gross defects (hard faults) from failing devices due to excessive parametric deviations (soft faults). Thus, the defect filter is key in developing a unified hard/soft fault diagnosis approach. Two types of diagnosis can be carried out according to the decision of the defect filter: hard faults are diagnosed using a multi-class classifier, whereas soft faults are diagnosed using inverse regression functions.

Dynamic reliability management (DRM) has been proposed as a mechanism to dynamically explore the trade-off between system performance and reliability margin. However, existing DRM methods are hampered by the fact that they do not accurately model spatial and temporal variations in process and temperature parameters which have a strong impact on chip reliability. In addition, they make the simplifying assumption that the future workloads are identical to the currently observed one. This makes them sensitive to sudden workload variations and outliers. In this paper, we present a novel workload-aware dynamic reliability management framework that accounts for local variations in both the process and temperature. The reliability estimation, along with the predicted remaining workload is fed to a dynamic voltage/frequency scaling module to manage the system reliability and optimize processor performance. Using a fast on-line analytical/table-look-up method we demonstrate an average error of 1% with up to 5 orders of magnitude speedup compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments on an Alpha-like processor show our DRM framework fully utilizes the available margin and achieves 28.7% performance improvement on average.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457139","","Control systems;Dynamic voltage scaling;Electric breakdown;Failure analysis;Frequency estimation;Power system management;Power system reliability;System performance;Temperature sensors;Voltage control","Monte Carlo methods;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips;power aware computing","Monte Carlo simulation;alpha-like processor;chip reliability;dynamic reliability management;dynamic voltage scaling module;frequency scaling module;process variation;processor performance;reliability estimation;temperature parameters;temperature-aware reliability management","","8","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, although some speed acceleration methods for MC simulation have been proposed, their efficiency is not high enough for MC-based yield optimization (determines optimal device sizes and optimizes yield at the same time), which requires repeated yield calculations. In this paper, a new sampling-based yield optimization approach is presented, called the Memetic Ordinal Optimization (OO)-based Hybrid Evolutionary Constrained Optimization (MOHECO) algorithm, which significantly enhances the efficiency for yield optimization while maintaining the high accuracy and generality of MC simulation. By proposing a two-stage estimation flow and introducing the OO technology in the first stage, sufficient samples are allocated to promising solutions, and repeated MC simulations of non-critical solutions are avoided. By the proposed memetic search operators, the convergence speed of the algorithm can considerably be enhanced. With the same accuracy, the resulting MOHECO algorithm can achieve yield optimization by approximately 7 times less computational effort compared to a state-of-the-art MC-based algorithm integrating the acceptance sampling (AS) plus the Latin-hypercube sampling (LHS) techniques.

The complete infrastructure necessary to make these predictions is placed in the open source domain, with the hope that it will invigorate research in this area.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456958","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Circuit faults;Circuit noise;Circuit topology;Latches;Pulse inverters;Random access memory;Resilience;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;fault location;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit technology","CMOS circuits;extrinsic noise sources;fault rates;hard faults;intrinsic noise sources;open source domain;resilience roadmap;technology scaling","","27","","12","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach is to use the same mask on several instances of an algorithm. This paper proposes a novel power analysis method called Power Variance Analysis (PVA) to reveal the danger of such implementations. PVA uses the fact that the side-channel leakage of parallel circuits has a big variance when they are given the same but random inputs. This paper introduces the basic principle of PVA and a series of PVA experiments including a successful PVA attack against a prototype RSL-AES implemented on SASEBO-R.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456966","Masking;RSL;Side Channel Attacks;Variance","Analysis of variance;Application specific integrated circuits;Costs;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Hardware;Prototypes;Security;Signal analysis;Software prototyping","application specific integrated circuits;cryptography","AES;ASIC implementation;DPA;parallel circuits;power analysis method;power variance analysis;side-channel leakage","","2","","16","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Waste-aware dilution and mixing of biochemical samples with digital microfluidic biochips","Roy, S.; Bhattacharya, B.B.; Chakrabarty, K.","Dept. of CSE, Indian Inst. of Technol. Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2011","20110505","2011","","","1","6","A key challenge in design automation of digital microfluidic biochips is to carry out on-chip dilution/mixing of biochemical samples/reagents for achieving a desired concentration factor (CF). In a bioassay, reducing the waste is crucial because the waste droplet handling is cumbersome and the number of waste reservoirs on-chip needs to be minimized to use limited volume of sample and expensive reagents and hence to reduce the cost of a biochip. The existing dilution algorithms attempt to reduce the number of mix/split steps required in the process but focus little on minimization of sample requirement or waste droplets. In this work, we characterize the underlying combinatorial properties of waste generation and identify the inherent limitations of two earlier mixing algorithms (BS algorithm by Thies et al., Natural Computing 2008; DMRW algorithm by Roy et al., IEEE TCAD 2010) in addressing this issue. Based on these properties, we design an improved dilution/mixing algorithm (IDMA) that optimizes the usage of intermediate droplets generated during the dilution process, which in turn, reduces the demand of sample/reagent and production of waste. The algorithm terminates in O(n) steps for producing a target CF with a precision of 1/2<sup>n</sup>. Based on simulation results for all CF values ranging from 1/1024 to 1023/1024 using a sample (100% concentration) and a buffer solution (0% concentration), we present an integrated scheme of choosing the best waste-aware dilution algorithm among BS, DMRW, and IDMA for any given value of CF. Finally, an architectural layout of a DMF biochip that supports the proposed scheme is designed.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763174","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Biological system modeling;Electrodes;Layout;Minimization;System-on-a-chip","biochemistry;drops;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics;waste","DMF biochip;bioassay;biochemical sample mixing;concentration factor;digital microfluidic biochip;improved dilution/mixing algorithm;sample requirement minimization;waste droplet handling;waste generation;waste reservoir;waste-aware dilution","","16","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in 2010 approximately 75% of design starts used 130 nanometers or greater CMOS technologies [1], and 25% of wafers were fabricated using these “trailing edge” technologies [2]. There are possibly more designers working at 130 nanometers and above than at 90 nanometers and below, and there is certainly much more to electronics than just digital CMOS and microprocessors, and in order for the electronic industry to continue delivering on promises, “More than Moore” is needed, besides “More of Moore”.

"Gait analysis for fall prediction using hierarchical textile-based capacitive sensor arrays","Baldwin, R.; Bobovych, S.; Robucci, R.; Patel, C.; Banerjee, N.","CSEE, Univ. of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA","Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2015","20150423","2015","","","1293","1298","Falls are a major cause of injuries in adults above the age of sixty-five. The economic aftermath of falls and their consequent hospitalization can be huge, totaling more than 30 billion dollars in 2010 alone. A plausible way of mitigating this problem is accurate prediction of future falls and taking proactive remedial action. Spatio-temporal variation in gait is a reliable indicator of a future fall, however, existing systems focus on gait analysis in clinical settings and are not tuned towards continuous gait analysis. In this paper, we present the design of a novel textile capacitive sensor array-based system built into clothing that can reliably capture spatio-temporal gait attributes in a home setting. A key novel research contribution of our work is a context-aware hierarchical signal processing architecture that breaks down the signal processing algorithm into a hierarchy of processing elements. The lower power processing components perform generic feature extraction using observations derived from the capacitor plates, while the higher-level processors aggregate features to infer gait attributes such as stride speed and inter-leg spacing. The system activates the higher power processing elements only when it detects walking. We have prototyped our system using textile capacitive plates built into an ace-bandage and a custom FPGA-based system and show that our system can accurately detect gait attributes that have high correlation with falls, while consuming minimal energy as estimated for a multi-clock-domain 180-nm IC.","","978-3-9815-3704-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092592","","Accuracy;Capacitive sensors;Capacitors;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Sensor arrays","capacitive sensors;capacitors;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;gait analysis;injuries;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;sensor arrays;spatiotemporal phenomena","FPGA-based system;ace-bandage;context-aware hierarchical signal processing architecture;fall prediction;feature extraction;gait analysis;hierarchical textile-based capacitive sensor arrays;higher-level processors aggregate features;hospitalization;injuries;inter-leg spacing;multiclock-domain IC;spatiotemporal gait attributes;spatiotemporal variation;stride speed;textile capacitive plates;walking","","0","","","","","9-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
