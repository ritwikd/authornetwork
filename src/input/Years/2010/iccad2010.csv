Despite its importance in design rectification, technology mapping, and other logic synthesis applications, there is no much direct study on this subject due to its generality and consequent computational complexity. This paper extends our prior Boolean matching decision procedure BooM to consider multiple-output functions. Through conflict-driven learning and partial assignment reduction, Boolean matching in the most general setting can still be accomplishable even when all other techniques lose their foundation and become unapplicable. Experiments demonstrate the indispensable power of strengthened learning for practical applications.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654215","","Boolean functions;Complexity theory;Cost accounting;Data preprocessing;Impedance matching;Kernel;Runtime","Boolean functions;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence)","BooM;computational complexity;design rectification;function vectors Boolean matching;logic synthesis;technology mapping","","1","","24","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Bi-decomposition of large Boolean functions using blocking edge graphs","Choudhury, M.; Mohanram, K.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

The complexity of bi-decomposition techniques is in achieving a good variable partition for the given logic function. State-of-the-art techniques use heuristics and/or brute-force enumeration for variable partitioning, which results in sub-optimal results and/or poor scalability with function complexity. This paper describes a fast, scalable algorithm for obtaining provably optimum variable partitions for bi-decomposition of Boolean functions by constructing an undirected graph called the blocking edge graph (BEG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that demonstrates a systematic approach to derive disjoint and overlapping variable partitions for bi-decomposition. Since a BEG has only one vertex per input, our technique scales to Boolean functions with hundreds of inputs. Results indicate that on average, BEG-based bi-decomposition reduces the number of logic levels (mapped delay) of 16 benchmark circuits by 60%, 34%, 45%, and 30% (20%, 19%, 16% and 20%) over the best results of state-of-the-art tools FBDD, SIS, ABC, and an industry-standard synthesizer, respectively.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654210","","Benchmark testing;Delay;Logic functions;Logic gates;Partitioning algorithms;Synthesizers","Boolean functions;graph theory;logic design;network synthesis","Boolean function bidecomposition;blocking edge graph;logic function;logic synthesis;optimum variable partition","","3","","12","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, from a thermal perspective, vertical integration of high-performance ICs in the form of 3D stacks is highly demanding since the effective areal heat dissipation increases with number of dies (with hotspot heat fluxes up to 250 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) generating high chip temperatures. In this context, inter-tier integrated microchannel cooling is a promising and scalable solution for high heat flux removal. A robust design of a 3D IC and its subsequent thermal management depend heavily upon accurate modeling of the effects of liquid cooling on the thermal behavior of the IC during the early stages of design. In this paper we present 3D-ICE, a compact transient thermal model (CTTM) for the thermal simulation of 3D ICs with multiple inter-tier microchannel liquid cooling. The proposed model is compatible with existing thermal CAD tools for ICs, and offers significant speed-up (up to 975x) over a typical commercial computational fluid dynamics simulation tool while preserving accuracy (i.e., maximum temperature error of 3.4%). In addition, a thermal simulator has been built based on 3D-ICE, which is capable of running in parallel on multicore architectures, offering further savings in simulation time and demonstrating efficient parallelization of the proposed approach.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653749","3D IC;Compact modeling;inter-tier cooling;microchannel","Heating;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Microchannel;Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays","cooling;integrated circuit design;thermal management (packaging);three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC;3D-ICE;compact transient thermal modeling;heat flux removal;intertier integrated microchannel cooling;intertier liquid cooling;thermal management;three dimensional stacked integrated circuits","","59","1","30","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the complexity of Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations, the minimization of clock skew has faced a great challenge. To overcome the influence of PVT variations, several previous works proposed Post Silicon Tuning (PST) architecture to dynamically balance the skew of a clock tree. In the PST architecture, there are two main components: Adjustable Delay Buffer (ADB) and Phase Detector (PD). Most previous works focus on determining good positions of ADBs in a PST design. In this paper, we first show that which pairs of FFs are connected to PDs, called PD structure, also greatly influence the complexity of hardware control for a PST design. Without careful planning of a PD structure, we need large number of control signals to adjust the delays of ADBs. In addition, we also show that a PD structure may influence the accuracy of the clock skew. Among possible connection structures, this paper proposes an efficient PD structure which not only simplifies the hardware control but also minimizes the clock skew of a PST design.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654274","Adjustable Delay Buffer;Phase Detector;Post-Silicon Tuning","Clocks;Delay;Hardware;Heuristic algorithms;Joining processes;Synchronization;Wire","CAD;electronic engineering computing;phase detectors","ADB;CAD;PD structure;PST architecture;PST design;adjustable delay buffer;computer aided design;control signals;controlling structure;phase detector;postsilicon clock skew minimization;postsilicon tuning","","4","","7","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when deciding to adopt this emerging technology as a mainstream design approach, designers must consider the cost of 3D integration. IC testing is a key factor that affects the final product cost, and it could be a major portion of the total IC cost. In 3D IC design, various testing strategies and different integration methods could affect the final product cost dramatically, and the interaction with other cost factors could result in various trade-offs. This paper develops a comprehensive and parameterized testing cost model for 3D IC integration, and analyzes the trade-offs associated with testing strategies and testing circuit overheads.

A major outstanding challenge is the inaccuracy resulting from fitting the complex behavior of scaled transistors to posynomial functions. Fitting over a large region can be grossly inaccurate, and in fact, poor posynomial fit can lead to failure to find a true feasible solution. On the other hand, fitting over smaller regions and then selecting the best region, incurs exponential complexity. In this paper, we advance a novel optimization strategy that circumvents these dueling problems in the following manner: by explicitly handling the error of the model in the course of optimization, we find a potentially suboptimal, but feasible solution. This solution subsequently guides a range-refinement process of our transistor models, allowing us to reduce the range of operating conditions and dimensions, and hence obtain far more accurate GP models. The key contribution is in using the available oracle (SPICE simulations) to identify solutions that are feasible with respect to the accurate behavior rather than the fitted model. The key innovation is the explicit link between the fitting error statistics and the rate of the error uncertainty set increase, which we use in a robust optimization formulation to find feasible solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a two benchmarks: a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier and a voltage controlled oscillator designed in TSMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. Our algorithm is able to identify superior solution points producing uniformly better power and area values under gain constraint with improvements of up to 50% in power and 10% in area for the amplifier design. We also demonstrate that when utilizing the models with the same level of modeling error, our method yields solutions that meet the constraints while the violations for the standard method were as high as 4- - 5% and larger than 15% for several constraints.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654325","","Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Optimization;Robustness;SPICE;Transistors;Uncertainty","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue integrated circuits;error statistics;operational amplifiers","CMOS operational amplifier;SPICE simulations;TSMC;analog circuits;equation based optimization;error statistics;exponential complexity;geometric programming;optimization strategy;posynomial functions;robust analog optimization;transistor models;voltage controlled oscillator","","0","","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These test structures are almost always design independent and measured/monitored by the foundry to keep track of process deviations. We propose a design-dependent process monitoring strategy which can accurately predict design performance based on simple I<sub>eff</sub>-based delay and I<sub>off</sub>-based leakage power estimates. We show that our strategy works much better (0.99 correlation vs. 0.87) compared to conventional design-independent monitors. Further, we use the predicted delay and leakage power for early yield estimation for pruning bad wafers to save test and back-end manufacturing costs We show that wafer pruning based on our approach can achieve upto 98% of the maximum achievable benefit/profit. We design the measurement and prediction schemes so as to minimize data as well as computation that needs to be kept track of during wafer fabrication.

"Analysis of circuit dynamic behavior with timed ternary decision diagram","Lu Wan; Deming Chen","ECE Dept., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20101203","2010","","","516","523","Modern logic optimization tools tend to optimize circuits in a balanced way so that all primary outputs (POs) have similar delay close to the cycle time. However, certain POs will be exercised more frequently than the rest. Among these critical primary outputs, some may be stabilized very quickly by input vectors, even if their topological delays from primary inputs are very long. Knowing the dynamic behavior of a circuit can help optimize the most commonly activated paths and help engineers understand how resilient a PO is against dynamic environmental variations such as voltage fluctuations. In this paper, we describe a tool to analyze the dynamic behavior of a circuit utilizing probabilistic information. The techniques exploit the use of timed ternary decision diagrams (tTDD) to encode stabilization conditions for POs. To compute probabilities based on a tTDD, we propose false assignment pruning and random variable compaction to preserve probability calculation accuracy. To deal with the scalability issue, this paper proposes a new circuit partitioning heuristic to reduce the inaccuracy introduced by partitioning. Compared to the timed simulation results, our tool has a mean absolute error of 2.5% and a root mean square error of 5.3% on average for ISCAS-85 benchmarks. Compared to a state-of-the-art dynamic behavior analysis tool, our tool is on average 40× faster and can handle circuits that the previous tool cannot.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653852","","Boolean functions;Clocks;Data structures;Delay;Mathematical model;Probability","circuit optimisation;circuit stability;decision diagrams;logic circuits","circuit dynamic behavior analysis;circuit optimization;critical primary outputs;logic optimization tools;stabilization conditions;timed ternary decision diagram","","4","","20","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing analytical techniques to evaluate performance of fixed-point systems are not applicable to the errors due to quantization in the presence of un-smooth operators. Thus, it is inevitable to use simulation to evaluate performance of fixed-point systems in the presence un-smooth operators. This paper proposes a hybrid technique which can be used in place of pure simulation to accelerate the performance evaluation. The principle idea in the proposed hybrid approach is to selectively simulate parts of the system only when un-smooth errors occur but use analytical results otherwise. The acceleration thus obtained reduces the performance evaluation time which can be used to explore a wider word-length design space or speedup the optimization process. This method has been tried on a complex MIMO sphere decoding algorithm and the results obtained show several orders of magnitude improvement in terms of evaluation time.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654064","Fixed-point system design;Performance evaluation;Quantization noise;Word-length Optimization","Acceleration;Analytical models;Noise;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Quantization;Signal processing algorithms","MIMO communication;decoding;optimisation;quantisation (signal);signal processing","complex MIMO sphere decoding;fixed point refinement;fixed point systems;hybrid technique;optimization;performance evaluation;quantization;signal processing;un-smooth operators;word length design space","","5","","11","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enable this technique, layout decomposition is applied to split a layout into two non-conflicting patterns. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-hard in general, especially for layouts with random logic. Thus, high quality results are hard to be achieved in reasonable time. Previously, several graph partitioning techniques have been presented in order to speed up the process, with the tradeoff of the quality of results (QoR). We propose a graph division method that does not have this deficiency. First, we start with a conflict graph derived from a layout. Based on a data structure named SPQR-tree, the graph is divided into its triconnected components in linear time. The solutions of these components are then combined in a way that no QoR is lost. Thus, we call this method a ”lossless” method.

In this paper, we tackle the memory performance issue of multimedida MPSoCs through intelligent memory access scheduling. We observe that since memory resources are shared by all processing elements in an MPSoC, interferences among requests from different IP cores cause not only delay in memory accesses but also unfair DRAM accesses among IPs. Traditional memory scheduling policies that only emphasize on maximizing memory system throughput do not take into account these interferences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical memory scheduling policy to minimize interferences among requests.

This paper proposes the first mask-sharing methodology for DPT, which can share masks among different designs, to reduce the number of costly masks for double patterning. The design methodology consists of two tasks: template-mask design and template-mask-aware routing. A graph matching-based algorithm is developed to design a flexible template mask that tries to accommodate as many design patterns as possible.

However, with the advances of post-silicon techniques, accurate variation model is also highly desired in various post-silicon applications, such as post-silicon tuning, test vector generation, and reliability prediction. The accuracy of such post-silicon variation models is greatly improved by incorporating test measurements from each wafer or die. However, to limit test cost, the number of measurements must be reduced as much as possible. This paper proposes an active learning framework to dynamically extract post-silicon process variation models with tightened variance from measurements. The framework is composed of two stages, active training and model adaptation. Active training collects information and initializes the models to be used for the forthcoming wafers. Model adaptation stage then validates the models and optimally determines the test configuration for partial testing to reduce the test cost. Experimental results based on the measurements from two industrial processes show that the proposed framework can achieve variation models with variance reduction of ~80% when compared with design-time variation models. Meanwhile, the average estimation error for those untested sites is well maintained at ~2-3% using merely ~30% available test structures for two processes.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653806","","Adaptation model;Data models;Measurement uncertainty;Semiconductor device modeling;Testing;Training;Uncertainty","cost reduction;electronic engineering education;estimation theory;industrial training;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor device testing","active learning;active training;average estimation error;design-time analysis;industrial process;model adaptation;optimization;partial testing;post-silicon process variation model;post-silicon technique;post-silicon tuning;post-silicon variation extraction;reliability prediction;test cost reduction;test measurement;test vector generation;wafer","","3","","23","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fast-growing design complexity with large-scale mixed-size macros and standard cells has caused significant challenges to modern circuit placement. Analytical algorithms have been shown to be most effective for standard-cell placement, but the problems with the rotation and legalization of large macros impose intrinsic limitations for analytical placement. Consequently, most recent works on mixed-size placement resort to combinatorial macro placement. Instead, this paper presents the first attempt to resolve the intrinsic problems with a unified analytical approach. Unlike traditional analytical placement that uses only wire and density forces to optimize the positions of circuit components, we present a new force, the rotation force, to handle macro orientation for analytical mixed-size placement. The rotation force tries to rotate each macro to its desired orientation based on the wire connections on this macro. A cross potential model is also proposed to increase the rotation freedom during placement. The final orientation of each macro with legalization consideration is then determined by mathematical programming at the end of global placement. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Compared with state-of-the-art mixed-size placement approaches (such as FLOP, CG, and MP-tree), our approach achieves the best average wirelength efficiently.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654240","","Force;Law;Mathematical model;Mathematical programming;Pins;Wire","circuit complexity;large-scale systems;mathematical programming;network synthesis","analytical global placement;circuit placement;combinatorial macro placement;cross potential model;design complexity;large-scale mixed-size circuit designs;large-scale mixed-size macros;mathematical programming;rotation force","","1","","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The graph transformation algorithm handles the constraints from nonpositive loops effectively, completely avoiding the heuristics used in other existing methods.

Modern SoCs deploy not only simple buses but also crossbars and Networks-on-Chip (NoC) to connect dozens or even hundreds of modules. However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these interconnects because of their complexity. This is a potential design risk. In order to address this challenge, early design space exploration is required to find appropriate system architectures out of many candidate architectures. An appropriate interconnect architecture is a fundamental outcome of these evaluations since its latency and throughput characteristics affect the performance of all attached modules in the SoC. In this paper we show how to perform early design space exploration using our Electronic System Level (ESL) performance evaluation framework SystemQ.

Based on these candidates, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed to simultaneously minimize the number of conflicts and stitches, while introducing as less layout perturbation as possible. To improve scalability, we further propose three acceleration techniques without loss of solution quality: odd-cycle union optimization, coloring-independent group computing, and suboptimal solution pruning.

Smart deterministic approaches have been proposed that employ statistical timing analysis to reduce pessimism in the guardbands while retaining the deterministic nature of the algorithms. Other statistical optimization techniques focus on algorithms to maximize robustness of design while being aware of variability. It is not clear how much improvement can be gained using the latter set of approaches over more simple deterministic approaches. This work presents a new lower bound to evaluate these statistical optimization techniques, drawing inspiration from recent advances in sampling based SSTA. We prove that the presented lower bound gives the minimum possible area that can be achieved for a design while meeting a particular timing yield, which is the percentage of die that meeting a specified timing constraint. We then compare several statistical design optimization approaches, including one proposed in this paper called SLOP, against the computed lower bound. We show that even the simplest statistical optimization approaches produce area results which are, on average, within 9.6% of the lower bound while the best ones performed only marginally better, reaching within 3.7% of the bound. This demonstrates that the proposed bound is a close bound. In addition, it also shows that the existing optimization methods have nearly exhausted the obtainable improvement from being statistically aware and mostly provide trade-offs in runtime speed.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654194","Gate Sizing;Monte Carlo;Statistical Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Optimization;Transistors","circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;statistical analysis","SLOP;circuit design;lower bound computation;smart deterministic approach;statistical design;statistical optimization;statistical timing analysis;timing constraint;timing yield","","0","","24","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another megatrend in advanced technologies is that power has become the most critical design constraint.

However, most existing academic mixed-size placers either focus on wirelength minimization alone, or do not consider the impact of movable macros on routing. To remedy these insufficiencies, this paper formulates design-hierarchy information as a novel fence force in an analytical placement framework. Unlike a state-of-the-art routability-driven placer that simply removes net bounding boxes during placement, this paper utilizes two different optimization forces, the global fence force and the local spreading force, to determine the positions of both standard cells and macros. We utilize design-hierarchy information to determine block distributions globally, and locally we add additional spreading forces to preserve sufficient free space among blocks by a net-topology estimation. With the interactions between these two forces, our placer can well balance routability and wirelength. Experimental results show that our placer can achieve the best routability and routing time among all published works.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654234","","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Force;Metals;Optimization;Routing;Wire","network routing;network synthesis;network topology;optimisation","block distributions;design hierarchy aware mixed-size placement;large-scale mixed-size circuit placement;net-topology estimation;routability optimization;routability-driven placer","","6","","18","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a simple implementation method which does not use any BDD package. Sharing is implemented by directly hashing minors, while the requirement on symbol ordering is weakened to an expansion ordering. The basic mechanism used is a natural formulation of layered expansion which is analogous to manual expansion of a determinant, hence it is easily understood.

It is defined in the ISPD 2010 High Performance Clock Network Synthesis Contest, and it is a novel criterion that captures process variation effects on a clock network. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that creates a mesh upon a tree topology. Total wire and buffer capacitance is minimized under the LCS and slew constraints. In our method, a clock mesh will be built first according to the positions and capacitance of the sinks. A top-level tree is then built to drive the mesh.

High-level synthesis has been touted as a solution to the design-productivity gap by allowing designers to move up to a higher level of abstraction where they focus on the functionality of the circuit instead of the low level details. However, at the same time, the move to deep submicron processes has led to increased levels of process variation, which must be considered during synthesis so that the performance yield of the circuit meets design specifications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of performance yield optimization during the scheduling task of high-level synthesis. We formulate the problem of performance yield optimization for scheduling as an integer linear programming problem (ILP) and offer the following contributions: 1) a totally unimodular ILP formulation for performance yield maximization and 2) a variation-aware and layout-driven iterative algorithm for performance yield improvement.

We demonstrate the feasibility by means of an H.264 video encoder (although not limited to that) for various technology nodes. The complex and unpredictable processing behavior of an H.264 encoder represents thereby a real-world scenario. Our results show on average more than 30% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art.

The macromodel that emerges is a scalar, nonlinear time-varying equation that accurately characterizes the system's phase/timing responses. We establish strong links of this technique with projection frameworks for model order reduction. We then present numerical methods to compute the phase model. The computation involves a full Floquet decomposition - we discuss numerical issues that arise if direct computation of the monodromy matrix is used for Floquet analysis, and propose an alternative method that are numerically superior. The new method has elegant connections to the Jacobian matrix in harmonic balance method (readily available in most RF simulators). We validate the technique on several highly nonlinear systems, including an inverter chain and a firing neuron. We demonstrate that the new scalar nonlinear phase model captures phase responses under various types of input perturbations, achieving accuracies considerably superior to those of reduced models obtained using LTI/LPTV MOR methods.

We consider application phases and the implications of changing cache miss rates on the ideal power control state. We first propose a two-stage DVFS algorithm based on formulating the throughput-constrained energy minimization problem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). This algorithm uses a power model that adapts to application phase changes by observing processor hardware performance counter values. The solutions it produces provide upper bounds on the energy savings achievable under a performance constraint. However, this algorithm assumes a priori (oracle or profiling-based) knowledge of application phase change behavior. To relax this assumption, we propose P-DVFS, an predictive DVFS algorithm for on-line minimization of energy consumption under a performance constraint without requiring a priori knowledge of an application's behavior. P-DVFS uses hardware performance counter based performance and power models. It predicts remaining execution time online in order to control voltage and frequency settings to optimize energy consumption and performance. The P-DVFS problem is formulated as a multiple-choice knapsack problem, which can be efficiently and optimally solved online. We evaluated P-DVFS using direct measurement of a real DVFS-equipped system. When bounding performance loss to at most 20% of that at the maximum frequency and voltage, P-DVFS leads to energy consumptions within 1.83% of the optimal solution for our problem instances on average with a maximum deviation of 4.83%. In addition to producing results approaching those of an oracle formulation, P-DVFS reduces power consumption for our problem instances by 9.93% on average, and up to 25.64%, compared with the most advanced related work.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653631","","Energy consumption;Equations;Frequency control;Mathematical model;Minimization;Power demand;Time frequency analysis","cache storage;energy consumption;knapsack problems;power aware computing;voltage control","cache miss rates;energy consumption;energy optimization;memory access aware on-line voltage control;multiple-choice knapsack problem;online minimization;oracle;performance optimization;power control state;predictive dynamic voltage-frequency scaling control;profiling-based knowledge;throughput-constrained energy minimization problem","","1","","18","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a class of eigendecomposition-based fast Poisson solvers (FPS) for chiplevel thermal analysis. We start with a solver that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in O(NlogN) time, where N is the dimension of the finite-difference matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods.

This results in adjacent devices with different mean critical dimension (CD), and uncorrelated CD variation. Such a mismatch can increase functional failures in SRAM cells and degrade yield. This paper analyzes the impact of DPL on functional failures in SRAM bitcells, and proposes a DPL-aware SRAM sizing scheme to effectively mitigate yield losses. Experimental results based on 45nm industrial models and test chip measurements show that DPL can significantly impact SRAM cell robustness. Using the proposed DPL-aware sizing scheme, the SRAM cell failure probability can be reduced by up to 3.6X.

We present an algorithm that tackles the addressed layer assignment problem in a net-by-net manner. An existing dynamic-programming-based single-net layer assignment method that can only consider the via count is judiciously modified and adopted by our algorithm to handle both antenna avoidance and via count minimization for each net. To further reduce the via count but without increasing the amount of antenna violations, a refinement procedure based on min-cost max-flow is developed and added to our algorithm.

This paper presents the first work for the problem of ECO timing optimization considering redundant wires (unused wires or dummy metals) to minimize the number of rewiring layers. We first propose a multi-commodity flow model for the spare-cell selection problem and apply integer linear programming (ILP) to simultaneously optimize all timing-violated paths. The ILP formulation minimizes the number of used spare cells and considers the routability of the selected spare cells. Then, we develop a tile-based ECO router which minimizes the number of rewiring layers by reusing redundant wires.

These devices enable the electrical manipulation of microfluidics with various advantages such as low power consumption, flexibility, accuracy, and efficiency. In addressing the need for low-cost and practical fabrication, pin-count reduction has become a key problem to the large-scale integration of EWOD-chip designs. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually compatible control signals. Most previous studies utilize this addressing scheme by scheduling fluidic-level synthesis on pin-constrained chip arrays. However, the associated interconnect routing problem is still not provided in currently available DMF automations, and thus the broadcast-addressing scheme cannot be actually realized. In this paper, we present the first network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for EWOD-chip designs with a broadcast electrode-addressing scheme. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and wirelength minimization into consideration for higher integration and better design performance.

In this paper, we propose minimum-violations partitioning (MVP), a scan-cell clustering method that can support multiple capture cycles in delay testing without increasing test-data volume. This method is based on an integer linear programming model and it can cluster the scan flip-flops into balanced parts with minimum capture violations.

The problem is especially pronounced for lower level metals used for local routing, where bi-directionality gives rise to lithography unfriendly layout patterns. However, one can modify such wires without significantly affecting design behavior. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously modify mask and target during OPC to improve lithographic yield. The method uses image slope information, available during image simulation at no extra cost, as a measure of process window. We derive a cost function that maximizes both contour fidelity and robustness to drive our simultaneous mask and target optimization (SMATO) method. We then develop analytical equations to predict the cost for a given mask and target modification and use a fast algorithm to minimize this cost function to obtain an optimal mask and target solution. Our experiments on sample metal1 (M1) layouts show that the use of SMATO reduces the Process Manufacturability Index (PMI) by 15.4% compared to OPC, which further leads to 69% reduction in the number of layout hotspots. Additionally, such improvement is obtained at low average runtime overhead (5.5%).

However, weakly nonpassive models may be generated for passive circuits and systems in various contexts, such as data fitting, model order reduction (MOR) and electromagnetic (EM) macromodeling. Therefore, a post-processing passivity enforcement algorithm is desired. Most existing algorithms are designed to handle pole-residue models. The few algorithms for state space models only handle regular systems (RSs) with a nonsingular D+D<sup>T</sup> term. To the authors' best knowledge, no algorithm has been proposed to enforce passivity for more general descriptor systems (DSs) and state space models with singular D+D<sup>T</sup> terms. In this paper, a new post-processing passivity enforcement algorithm based on perturbation of Hamiltonian-symplectic matrix pencil, PEDS, is proposed. PEDS, for the first time, can enforce passivity for DSs. It can also handle all kinds of state space models (both RSs and DSs) with singular D+D<sup>T</sup> terms. Moreover, a criterion to control the error of perturbation is devised, with which the optimal passive models with the best accuracy can be obtained. Numerical examples then verify that PEDS is efficient, robust and relatively cheap for passivity enforcement of DSs with mild passivity violations.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653885","","Algorithm design and analysis;Context modeling;Decision support systems;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Image segmentation;Integrated circuit modeling;Transfer functions","electromagnetic field theory;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;passive networks;perturbation techniques;state-space methods","Hamiltonian-symplectic matrix pencil perturbation;PEDS;data fitting;descriptor systems;electromagnetic macromodeling;model order reduction;passive circuits;passivity enforcement;pole-residue models;regular systems;singular D+DT terms;stable global interconnected simulation;state space models","","7","","25","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, owing to already large TSV size, large KOZ can significantly reduce the placement area available for cells, thus requiring larger dies which negate improvement in wirelength and timing due to 3D integration. In this paper, we study the impact of KOZ dimension on stress, carrier mobility variation, area, wirelength, and performance of 3D ICs. We demonstrate that, instead of requiring large KOZ, 3D-IC placers must exploit TSV stress-induced carrier mobility variation to improve the timing and area objectives during placement.

Thus, our online testing approach focuses on the processor units that affect application correctness the most, and it achieves high coverage while incurring minimal performance overhead. We also introduce a new metric, Application-Aware Fault Coverage, measuring a test's capability to detect faults that might have corrupted the state or the output of an application. Test coverage is further improved through the insertion of observation points that augment the coverage of the testing system. By evaluating our technique on a Sun OpenSPARC T1, we show that our solution maintains high Application-Aware Fault Coverage while reducing the performance overhead of online testing by more than a factor of 2 when compared to solutions oblivious to application's behavior.

Liquid cooling is a highly efficient solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems in 3D architectures; however, liquid cooling brings new challenges in modeling and runtime management. This paper proposes a novel controller for improving energy efficiency and reliability in 3D systems through liquid cooling management and dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS). The proposed fuzzy controller adjusts the liquid flow rate at runtime to match the cooling demand for preventing energy wastage of over-cooling and for maintaining a stable thermal profile. The DVFS decisions provide chip-level energy savings and help balancing the temperature across the system. Experimental results on 8- and 16-core multicore SoCs show that the controller prevents the system to exceed the given threshold temperature while reducing cooling energy by up to 50% and system-level energy by up to 21% in comparison to using a static worst-case flow rate setting.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654235","","Cooling;Heating;Microchannel;Multicore processing;Solid modeling;Thermal management;Three dimensional displays","cooling;fuzzy control;integrated circuit design;logic design;system-on-chip;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D architectures;3D stacked circuits;DVFS decisions;RF devices;accelerated thermal problems;chip-level energy savings;communication delay;cooling demand;cooling energy;dynamic voltage frequency scaling;energy efficiency;energy wastage;fuzzy controller;heterogeneous integration;high-performance 3D systems;liquid cooling management;liquid flow rate;multicore SoC;multicore system-on-chips;multitier systems;over-cooling;reliability problem;runtime management;stable thermal profile;static worst-case flow rate setting;system-level energy;sysyem-on-chip;threshold temperature;vertical integration","","8","","28","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that such an approach does not give us the best possible result. Second, we address the problem of TSV insertion. Because TSVs occupy silicon area, their location is decided during the placement stage of 3D design. However, we show that this is not the best possible stage for TSV insertion.

SPMs are utilized to host both code and data, often on the same physical unit. Synchronous dataflow (SDF) is a popular format for specifying many embedded system applications particularly in multimedia and network processing domains. Execution of SDF specifications on SPM based processors involves division of memory between actor code and buffers, and scheduling of actor executions and code overlays such that latency is minimized subject to the memory constraints. In our problem instance a traditional minimum buffer SDF schedule could require a larger code overlay overhead and therefore may not be optimal. The paper presents a three stage integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to solve the problem.

A design with NC's is not DPT-compliance and will eventually fail the decomposition, resulting in DFM redesign and longer design cycles. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for the NC existence and propose a geometry-based method for NC prediction to develop an early stage analyzer for DPT decomposability checking. Then, a wire perturbation algorithm is presented to fix as many NC's in the layout as possible. The algorithm is based on iterative 1D-compaction and can easily be embedded into existing industrial compaction systems.

Due to limitation in the bandwidth of trace buffers, only few state elements can be selected for tracing. In this work we first propose two improvements to existing “signal selection” algorithms to further increase the logic restorability inside the chip. In addition, we observe that different selections of trace signals can result in the same quality, measured as a logic visibility metric. Based on this observation, we propose a procedure which biases the selection to increase the restorability of a desired set of critical state elements, without sacrificing the (overall) logic visibility. We propose to select the critical state elements to increase the “timing visibility” inside the chip to facilitate the debugging of timing errors which are perhaps the most challenging type of error to debug at the post-silicon stage. Specifically, we introduce a case when the critical state elements are selected to track the transient fluctuations in the power delivery network which can cause significant variations in the delays of the speedpaths in the circuit in nanometer technologies.

Alternatively, one can pessimistically use a conservative speed to ensure timing guarantees, which might consume an excessive amount of energy as events might be processed faster than necessary. This paper presents an adaptive scheme that combines these two strategies for the scheduling of arbitrary event streams. The proposed adaptive DVS scheduler chooses the execution speed dynamically as long as it is below a certain threshold. Once the speed exceeds this threshold, the proposed scheduler operates at a constant (pessimistic) speed for guaranteeing the feasibility. The computation of the threshold speed is, however, not straight-forward. For deriving it, we make use of a framework based on timed model checking because the scheduler is strongly state-dependent. The resulting analysis framework allows to obtain the threshold speed for the proposed adaptive DVS scheduling algorithm such that both timing and speed constraints are guaranteed to be met and at the same time an energy-efficient execution is ensured.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654109","","Adaptation model;Adaptive scheduling;Energy consumption;Optimized production technology;Scheduling algorithm;Timing;Voltage control","greedy algorithms;power aware computing;scheduling","adaptive scheme;dynamic voltage scaling;energy-efficient execution;greedy online DVS scheduling;optimistic DVS scheduling;performance boosting;pessimistic DVS scheduling;timed model checking","","3","","19","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clock mesh structure are widely used in these designs because of its resistant to variations. However, traditional mesh structures suffer from several drawbacks such as difficulty in timing estimation, inability to handle obstacles, and high power consumption. This paper proposes a new obstacle-avoiding clock mesh synthesis method which applies a two-stage approach of mesh construction followed by driving-tree synthesis. The method achieves very low skew through structural optimization, thus eliminating the need of direct timing estimation and/or SPICE simulation during clock network synthesis. In addition, our approach handles obstacles with the structural consideration, and reduces power consumption by removing non-critical mesh components and optimizing the driving-tree structure. Based on the benchmarks of the ISPD'10 Clock Network Synthesis Contest, the top contest performers result in 1.32X skew over our approach by using mesh structure, and more than 2.0X skew over our approach by using tree structure.

As a high-level power optimization technique, voltage partitioning is effective in mitigating power density.

Since power density significantly impacts thermal-induced reliability, it is also desired to directly mitigate peak power density during voltage partitioning. Unfortunately, none of the existing works consider this. This paper proposes an efficient optimal voltage partitioning algorithm for peak power density minimization. Based on novel algorithmic techniques such as implicit power density binary search, the algorithm runs in O(n log n + m<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup> n) time, where n refers to the number of functional units and m refers to the number of partitions/voltage levels. Our experimental results on large testcases demonstrate that large amount of (about 9.7×) reduction in peak power density can be achieved compared to a natural greedy algorithm, while the algorithm still runs very fast.

In this paper, we propose novel techniques based on binary linear programming for clock mesh synthesis for the first time in the literature. The proposed approach can explore both regular and irregular mesh configurations, adapting to non-uniform load capacitance distribution. Our synthesis consists of two steps: mesh construction to minimize total capacitance and skew, and balanced sink assignment to improve slew/skew characteristics. We first show that mesh construction can be analytically formulated as binary polynomial programming (a class of nonlinear discrete optimization), then apply a compact linearization technique to transform into binary linear programming, significantly reducing computational overhead. Second, our balanced sink assignment enables a sink to tap the least loaded mesh segment (not the nearest one) with another binary linear programming which reduces both slew and skew. Experiments show that our techniques improve the worst skew and total capacitance by 14% and 15% over the state-of-the-art clock mesh algorithm on ISPD09 benchmarks.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653737","","Capacitance;Clocks;Estimation;Linear programming;Optimization;Polynomials;Wire","VLSI;clocks;linear programming;linearisation techniques;mesh generation;polynomial approximation","balanced sink assignment;binary linear programming;binary polynomial programming;compact linearization technique;high performance VLSI design;high performance clock mesh synthesis;mesh construction;nonlinear discrete optimization","","5","1","24","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Historically, `scheduling decisions' are implemented considering fixed task execution times, as for the case of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET). The limitations of scheduling considering WCET manifest in terms of under-utilization of resources for large application classes. In the realm of multicore systems, the notion of WCET is hardly meaningful due to the large set of factors influencing it. Within soft real-time systems, a more realistic modeling approach would be to consider tasks featuring varying execution times (i.e. stochastic). This paper addresses the problem of stochastic task execution time scheduling that is agnostic to statistical properties of the execution time. Our proposed method is orthogonal to any number of linear acyclic task graphs and their underlying architecture. The joint estimation of execution time and the associated parameters, relying on the interdependence of parallel tasks, help build a `nonlinear Non-Gaussian state space' model. To obtain nearly Bayesian estimates, irrespective of the execution time characteristics, a recursive solution of the state space model is found by means of the Monte Carlo method. The recursive solution reduces the computational and memory overhead and adapts statistical properties of execution times at run time. Finally, the variable laxity EDF scheduler schedules the tasks considering the predicted execution times. We show that variable execution time scheduling improves the utilization of resources and ensures the quality of service. Our proposed new solution does not require any a priori knowledge of any kind and eliminates the fundamental constraints associated with the estimation of execution times. Results clearly show the advantage of the proposed method as it achieves 76% better task utilization, 68% more task scheduling and deadline miss reduction by 53% compared to current state-of-the-ar- - t methods.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654114","Monte Carlo;Scheduling;joint estimation;parallel tasks;state space modeling;stochastic execution time;task utilization","Computational modeling;Correlation;Estimation;Joints;Mathematical model;Multicore processing;Software","Monte Carlo methods;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling;state-space methods;stochastic processes","Bayesian estimate;Monte Carlo method;SETS;multicore systems;nonlinear nonGaussian state space model;stochastic execution time scheduling;stochastic task execution time scheduling","","2","","24","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extremely complex estimation models are employed in the design space exploration of SoCs, and the efficacy of these estimation models is usually measured by the absolute error of the models compared to known actual results. Such absolute error based metrics can often result in over-designed estimation models, with a number of researchers suggesting that fidelity of an estimation model (correlation between the ordering of the estimated points and the ordering of the actual points) should be examined instead of, or in addition to, the absolute error. In this paper, for the first time, we propose four metrics to measure the fidelity of an estimation model, in particular for use in design space exploration. The first two are based on two well known rank correlation coefficients. The other two are weighted versions of the first two metrics, to give importance to points nearer the Pareto front. The proposed fidelity metrics range from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 reflects a perfect positive correlation while a value of -1 reflects a perfect negative correlation. The proposed fidelity metrics were calculated for a single processor estimation model and a multiprocessor estimation model to observe their behavior, and were compared against the models' absolute error. For the multiprocessor estimation model, even though the worst average and maximum absolute error of 6.40% and 16.61% respectively can be considered reasonable in design automation, the worst fidelity of 0.753 suggests that the multiprocessor estimation model may not be as good a model (compared to an estimation model with same or higher absolute errors but a fidelity of 0.95) as depicted by its absolute accuracy, leading to an over-designed estimation model.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653959","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Estimation;Frequency modulation;Mathematical model;Measurement;Space exploration","Pareto optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;system-on-chip","Pareto front;absolute error based metrics;design space exploration;estimation models;fidelity metrics;multiprocessor estimation model;rank correlation coefficients;system-on-chip","","2","","16","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It also shows how to incorporate clock-network synthesis into global placement to reduce dynamic power and insertion delay.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105342","","Capacitance;Clocks;Delay;Optimization;Robustness;Topology;Tuning","SPICE;circuit tuning;clocks;network topology;trees (mathematics)","ISPD 2009;ISPD 2010;PVT variations;SPICE-accurate optimizations;algorithmic tuning;clock network tuning;clock trees;clock-network synthesis contest;clock-network topology;derived nontree structures;dynamic power reduction;insertion delay reduction","","1","","35","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Panel: How will Cad Handle Billion-transistor Systems?","Aitken, R.","","Computer-Aided Design, 1998. ICCAD 98. Digest of Technical Papers. 1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050523","1998","","","5","5","Summary form only given, as follows. The SIA National Technology Roadmap and IvlooreÂ¿s Law both predict that logic chips containing one billion transistors will ship by the year 2010. This panel will explore the challenges awaiting the CAD industry as we move toward such huge chip:;. These chips will almost certainly include a variety of technologies, including logic, microprocessor cores, buses, static and dynamic memory, analog circuitry, and possibly micromechanical devices. Challenges loom at all levels of system abstraction, from artwork to architecture, and all aspects of CAD, from data management to algorithms. The panelists, whose expertise ranges from interconnect and noise through system-level synthesis, will begin by summarizing these CAD challenges and identifying key areas where contributions are needed, and then discuss promising research directions.","","1-58113-008-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=742799","","Transistors","","","","0","","","","","8-12 Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
