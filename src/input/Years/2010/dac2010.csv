In this and an accompanying paper [6], we proposed a new systematic model-driven flow for design of the proposed new scalable multi-facet arbiters through a 3-phase process combined with the template-based modular design approach: the design model derivation phase, the architecture model (or template) design phase as well as arbiter hardware implementation and generation phase. Here, we described the phase 1 of the design flow of how to induce an arbiter design model in detail by careful analysis of arbiter design issues and systematic design space exploring the construction of the model. Then, we continue to discuss the phase 2 of how to derive an architecture model or template using the reusability, modularity and expansibility techniques. With both the design and architecture models, designers can easily design or at least understand and thus choose many kinds of different but better arbiters efficiently. The phase 3 is described in the accompanying paper [6]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a systematic model-driven design approach is proposed for the practical hardware design.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523355","Model-driven design flow;architecture model/template;design model;design space;granularity;multi-facet arbiter","Algorithm design and analysis;Arithmetic;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Computer science;Design engineering;Hardware;Space exploration;Switches;System-on-a-chip","asynchronous circuits;logic design","arbiter hardware generation phase;arbiter hardware implementation phase;architecture model;architecture model design phase;design model;design model derivation phase;expansibility technique;model-driven design;modularity technique;multifacet arbiter generation;multiprocessor system-on-a-chips;reusability technique;template-based modular design approach","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an iterative design space exploration methodology exploiting the statistical properties of known system configurations to infer, by means of a correlation-based analysis, the next design points to be analyzed with low-level simulations. In fact, the knowledge of few design points is used to predict the expected improvement of unknown configurations. We show that the correlation of the configurations within the multi-processor design space can be modeled successfully with analytical functions and, thus, speed up the overall exploration phase. This makes the proposed methodology a model-assisted heuristic that, for the first time, exploits the correlation about architectural configurations to converge to the solution of the multi-objective problem.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522350","Design Space Exploration;Kriging;Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip;Response Surface","Analytical models;Context modeling;Delay;Design automation;Design methodology;Design optimization;Embedded computing;Iterative methods;Permission;Space exploration","correlation methods;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips;optimisation;system-on-chip","SoC;correlation-based design space exploration methodology;figures of merit;iterative design space exploration methodology;model-assisted heuristic;multiobjective optimization problem;multiprocessor systems-on-chip","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We explore the factors that make the problems harder on pin-constrained biochips. To cope with these cross contaminations, we propose (1) early crossing minimization algorithms during placement, and (2) systematic wash droplet scheduling and routing that require only one extra control pin and zero assay completion time overhead for practical bioassays.

"Scalable effort hardware design: Exploiting algorithmic resilience for energy efficiency","Chippa, V.K.; Mohapatra, D.; Raghunathan, A.; Roy, K.; Chakradhar, S.T.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","555","560","Algorithms from several interesting application domains exhibit the property of inherent resilience to “errors” from extrinsic or intrinsic sources, offering entirely new avenues for performance and power optimization by relaxing the conventional requirement of exact (numerical or Boolean) equivalence between the specification and hardware implementation. We propose scalable effort hardware design as an approach to tap the reservoir of algorithmic resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations. The basic tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended towards generation of the correct (exact) result, and expose them as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. A second major tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of algorithmic resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient SVM classification chip based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. We present results from post-layout simulations and demonstrate that scalable effort hardware can achieve large energy reductions (1.2X-2.2X with no impact on classification accuracy, and 2.2X-4.1X with modest reductions in accuracy) across various sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization leads to much improved energy vs. quality tradeoffs compared to each of the individual techniques.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523464","Approximate Computing;Low Power Design;Mining;Recognition;Scalable Effort;Support Vector Machines","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computer architecture;Design optimization;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Reservoirs;Resilience;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power aware computing;support vector machines","cross-layer optimization;energy efficiency;energy-efficient SVM classification chip;low power design;machine learning algorithm;scalable effort hardware design;support vector machines;synergistic cross-layer optimization","","14","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we introduce Virtual Prototyper (ViPro), a tool that helps SRAM designers explore the large design space by rapidly generating optimized virtual prototypes of complete SRAM macros. It does so by allowing designers to describe the SRAM components with varying levels of detail and by incorporating them into a hierarchical model that captures circuit and architectural features of the SRAM to optimize a complete prototype.

When unexpected behavior is observed in the post-silicon stage, one desires to identify the causes and consequently identify the fixes. This paper studies one formulation of the design-silicon mismatch problem. To analyze unexpected behavior, silicon behavior is partitioned into two classes, one class containing instances of unexpected behavior and the other with rest of the population. Classification rule learning is applied to extract rules to explain why certain class of behavior occurs. We present a rule learning algorithm that analyzes test measurement data in terms of design features to generate rules, and conduct controlled experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed learning approach can effectively uncover rules responsible for the design-silicon mismatch even when significant noises are associated with both the measurement data and the class partitioning results for capturing the unexpected behavior.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523108","Data Mining;Delay Test;Learning;Timing Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Data analysis;Data mining;Manufacturing processes;Noise measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Predictive models;Process design;Silicon;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;semiconductor industry","classification rule learning;cross-domain attributes;design-silicon mismatch problem;subgroup discovery","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows systems to become more capable of promptly adapting to different users' needs and of enhancing short- and long-term user satisfaction. Preliminary results show the potential of this methodology for maximizing the users' positive experience when running embedded applications on multiprocessor platforms.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523557","Embedded Systems;Flow experience;User satisfaction","Embedded system","embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;user centred design;user interfaces","flexible user-centric design;flow experience;human embedded systems;multiprocessor platforms;user satisfaction","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work first proposes a compact on-chip sensor design that tracks both NBTI and PBTI for both logic and SRAM circuits. Embedded in an SRAM array the sensor takes the form of a 6T SRAM cell and is at least 30× smaller than previous designs. Extensively reusing the SRAM peripheral circuitry minimizes control logic overhead. Sensing overhead is further amortized as the sensors can be both reconfigured and recycled as functional SRAM cells, potentially increasing SRAM yield when other bit cells fail due to initial process variation or long time aging effects. The paper also proposes a variation-aware sensor system design methodology by quantifying and leveraging the tradeoff between the size and number of sensors and the system sensing precision. Design examples show that a system of 500 sensors can achieve 4mV precision with 98.8% confidence, and a system of 1K sensors designed for 1M SRAM bit cells achieves 2000× area overhead reduction compared to a worst-case based approach.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522917","Aging;NBTI;PBTI;Process Variation;Redundancy;SRAM;Sensor;Sensor System Design;Yield","Aging;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Logic circuits;Niobium compounds;Random access memory;Reconfigurable logic;Sensor arrays;Sensor systems;Titanium compounds","","","","1","1","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reports device fabrication and modeling, as well as novel logic gate design using “laterally-actuated double-electrode NEMS” structures. The new device structure has several advantages over existing NEMS architectures such as being immune to impact bouncing and release vibrations (unlike a vertically-actuated NEMS) and offer higher flexibility to implement compact logic gates (unlike a single-electrode NEMS). A comprehensive analytical framework is developed to model different properties of these devices by solving the Euler-Bernoulli's beam equation. The proposed model is validated using measurement data for the fabricated devices. It is shown that by ignoring the non-uniformity of the electrostatic force distribution, the existing models “underestimate” the actual value of V<sub>pull-in</sub> and V<sub>pull-out</sub>. Furthermore, novel energy efficient NEMS-based circuit topologies are introduced to implement compact inverter, NAND, NOR and XOR gates. For instance, the proposed XOR gate can be implemented by using only two NEMS devices compared to that of a static CMOS-based XOR gate that requires at least 10 transistors.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523511","Energy-Efficient Electronics;Laterally-Actuated NEMS;Logic Design;Nano-Electro-Mechanical Switches;Process Variation;Steep-Subthreshold Switch","Differential equations;Electrostatic measurements;Energy efficiency;Fabrication;Logic design;Logic devices;Logic gates;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Nanoscale devices;Switches","beams (structures);logic gates;nanoelectromechanical devices;switches;vibrations","Euler-Bernoulli beam equation;NAND gates;NEMS based circuit;NOR gates;XOR gates;compact inverter;compact ultra energy efficient logic gates;impact bouncing;laterally actuated double electrode NEMS;nanoelectromechanical switches;release vibrations","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 3D ICs, it is essential to stack only good dies by testing the individual dies before stacking. For the clock signaling, the pre-bond testing requires a complete 2D clock tree on each die. The previous work enables the pre-bond testability by allocating specially designed resources called TSV-buffers and redundant trees with transmission gates. We proposes viable solutions to the two fundamental problems of the previous work: (1) using much less buffer resources by preventing (potentially `bad') TSV-buffers with a new tree topology generation algorithm; (2) completely removing the transmission gate control lines by using a specially designed component called self controlled clock transmission gate (SCCTG). Compared to the existing 3D tree topology generation algorithms, solution 1 can use 56%-88% less number of TSVs, 53%-67% less number of buffers, 22%-65% less total wirelength, and 26%-43% less clock power for the benchmark circuits with dense sink placements.

The TLMs are automatically generated from a given mapping of a concurrent application to a multi-core platform. The application code is annotated with delays at the basic-block level of granularity. Similarly, the platform services, such as communication and scheduling, also include timing delays. The TLM automation methods have been implemented in the embedded system environment (ESE) toolset. Our experimental results with ESE demonstrate that multi-core TLMs can be generated in the order of seconds; they simulate close to host-compiled application execution speed, and are more than 90% accurate compared to board measurements on average for industrial size examples.

The physical characteristics of a PRAM cell mainly depend on the material characteristic and the fabrication process. However, the access device and the operating voltage have significant impact on the PRAM performance, energy dissipation, and lifetime. In this paper, we study the design constraints for PRAM memory array, and propose design optimizations of the access device and the circuit operational voltage. The important features of PRAM memory, such as power consumption, read/write stability, speed, as well as lifetime are all considered as the constrained conditions in the proposed optimizations.

This paper proposes a novel design time body bias selection framework for parametric yield optimization while reducing testing costs. The framework considers both inter- and intra-die variations as well as power-performance correlations. This approach uses a feature extraction technique to explore the underlying similarity between the gates for effective clustering. Once the gates are clustered, a Gaussian quadrature based model is applied for fast yield analysis and optimization. This work also introduces an incremental method for statistical power computation to further reduce the optimization complexity.

The proportion of high- and low-V<sub>t</sub> gates of each block, which determines overall leakage power consumption, is dictated by timing assertion, yet dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation is not taken into account during conventional time budgeting. Bounded potential slack is introduced as a measure of dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation, and is experimentally shown to be strongly correlated with the percentage of high-V<sub>t</sub> gates. A new time budgeting is proposed with objective of achieving bounded potential slack, which is formulated as a linear programming problem. In experiments with example hierarchical designs implemented in 45-nm commercial technology, the proposed time budgeting reduced leakage power by 32% on average compared to conventional time budgeting, when both are followed by the same dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation.

The uni-directional current conducting TFETs limit the viability of 6 T SRAM cells. To overcome this limitation, 7 T SRAM designs were proposed earlier at the cost of extra silicon area. In this paper, we propose a novel 6 T SRAM design using Si-TFETs for reliable operation with low leakage at ultra low voltages. We also demonstrate that a functional 6 T TFET SRAM design with comparable stability margins and faster performances at low voltages can be realized using proposed design when compared with the 7 T TFET SRAM cell.

Meanwhile, leakage power dissipation becomes dominant in total power as technology scales. While multi-threshold voltage assignment has been shown as an effective way to reduce leakage, the NBTI-degradation rates vary with different initial threshold voltage assignment, and therefore motivates the co-optimizations of leakage reduction and NBTI mitigation. This paper minimizes leakage power during high-level synthesis of circuits with bounded delay degradation (thus guaranteed lifetime), using multi-V<sub>th</sub> resource libraries. We first propose a fast evaluation approach for NBTI-induced degradation of architectural function units, and multi-V<sub>th</sub> resource libraries are built with degradation characterized for each function unit. We then propose an aging-bounded high-level synthesis framework, within which the degraded delays are used to guide the synthesis, and leakage power is optimized through the proposed aging-aware resource rebinding algorithm. Experimental results show that, the proposed techniques can effectively reduce the leakage power with an extra 26% leakage reduction, compared to traditional aging-unaware multi-V<sub>th</sub> assignment approach.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419799","","Aging;Degradation;Delay;High level synthesis;Libraries;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Power dissipation;Threshold voltage;Titanium compounds","ageing;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;leakage currents","NBTI;aging aware resource rebinding algorithm;aging bounded high level synthesis;aging effects;bounded delay degradation;design time multi threshold voltage assignment;leakage power;negative bias temperature instability","","1","","20","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first solve a floorplanning problem that aims to reduce the RTA variations by evening out the STI density distribution. Next, we insert dummy polysilicon fills to further improve the uniformity of the STI density. Experimental results show that our floorplanner can reduce the global RTA variations by 39% and the local variations by 29% on average with low overhead compared to a traditional floorplanner, and the proposed dummy fill algorithm can further reduce the RTA variations to negligible amounts.

First, a chip is divided into several bins with equal size.

After that, an efficient legalization method which simultaneously preserves the cell orders in each row and minimizes the weighted sum of movement distances is developed to legalize cells in that region to limit the movable scope. To improve the legalization quality, HiBinLegalizer refreshes the positions of legalized cells during legalization. The legalizing procedure is repeated until all cells are non-overlapped. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, Abacus, HiBinLegalizer can reduce the total movement of cells to be 48% in average and save the largest movement of cells to be 140% in average.

Worsening the problem are recent trends towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs) with complex and sometimes non-deterministic memory subsystems prone to subtle, devastating bugs. This deteriorating situation is causing a growing portion of the validation effort to shift to post-silicon, when the first few hardware prototypes become available and where validation experiments are run directly on newly manufactured prototype hardware. While post-silicon validation enables much higher raw performance in test execution, it is a much more challenging environment for bug diagnosis and correction. In this work we briefly overview some of the current methodologies used in industry. We then discuss some recent ideas developed in our research group to leverage the performance advantage of post-silicon validation, while sidestepping its limitations of low internal node observability and expensive bug fixing.

Even though this advantage comes from the fact that pulsed-latch uses a short pulse, it is still capable of a small amount of time borrowing. A problem of allocating pulse width (out of a few predefined widths), where each width is modeled by a random variable, is formulated for minimizing the clock period of pulsed-latch circuits; this is equivalent to assigning a random variable that represents the amount of time borrowed by the combinational block between each latch pair. A statistical approach is important in this problem because assuming +3Â¿ of all pulse widths does not represent the worst case. An allocation algorithm called SPWA as well as an algorithm to compute timing yield is proposed. In experiments with 45-nm technology, compared to the case of no time borrowing, the clock period was reduced by 12.2% and 11.7% on average when the yield constraint Y<sub>c</sub> is 0.85 and 0.95, respectively; this is compared to the deterministic counterpart called DPWA, which reduced the clock period by 7.6% and 7.3%. More importantly, DPWA failed to satisfy the yield constraints in four (out of eleven) circuits while the yield constraints were always satisfied in SPWA.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419801","","Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Costs;Flip-flops;Latches;Pulse circuits;Pulse generation;Random variables;Space vector pulse width modulation;Timing","combinational circuits;flip-flops;logic design;timing","combinational block;deterministic pulse width allocation;pulsed-latch circuit designs;sequencing overhead;size 45 nm;statistical pulse width allocation;statistical time borrowing;timing analysis;timing yield","","3","","12","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce the pulsed-latch aware placement problem for timing integrity and present a unified placement framework to tackle this problem. Our new placer has the following distinguished features: (1) a multilevel pulsed-latch aware analytical placement framework to effectively prevent the potential pulse-width distortion problem, (2) a physical-information aware latch grouping algorithm to identify each desired group of a pulse generator and pulsed latches, and (3) a new optimization gradient for global placement to consider the impact of load capacitance of generators.

However, a highly relevant issue, parallel program performance modeling has received little attention in the EDA community. Performance modeling serves the critical role of guiding parallel algorithm design and provides a basis for runtime performance optimization. We propose a systematic composable approach for the performance modeling of a recently developed hierarchical multi-algorithm parallel circuit simulation (HMAPS) approach. The unique integration of inter- and intra-algorithm parallelisms allows a multiplicity of parallelisms to be exploited in HMAPS and also creates interesting modeling challenges in forms of complex performance tradeoffs and large runtime configuration space. We model the performances of key subtask entities as functions of workload and parallelism. We address significant complications introduced by inter-algorithm interactions in terms of memory contention and collaborative simulation behavior via novel penalty and statistical based modeling. The proposed approach is able to accurately predict the parallel performance of a given HMAPS configuration and hence enables the runtime optimization of the parallel simulation code.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523447","Transient simulation;parallel computing;performance modeling","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit simulation;Collaborative work;Design automation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Multicore processing;Optimization;Parallel algorithms;Predictive models;Runtime","CAD;circuit simulation;parallel algorithms","collaborative simulation behavior;hierarchical multialgorithm parallel circuit simulation approach;inter-algorithm parallelisms;intra-algorithm parallelisms;manycore systems;memory contention behavior;multicore processors;parallel CAD algorithm;parallel algorithm design;parallel program performance modeling;runtime performance optimization;statistical based modeling","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing methods either use Monte Carlo method in performance domain where thousands of simulations are required, or use local search in parameter domain where a number of simulations are required to characterize the point on the yield boundary defined by performance constraints. To improve efficiency, in this paper we propose QuickYield, a yield surface boundary determination by surface-point finding and global-search.

As a result, design of reversible circuits attracted great attention in the last years. The number of circuit lines is thereby a major criterion since it e.g. affects the still limited resource of qubits. Nevertheless, all approaches introduced so far for synthesis of complex reversible circuits need a significant amount of additional circuit lines - sometimes orders of magnitude more than the primary inputs. In this paper, we propose a post-process optimization method that addresses this problem. The general idea is to merge garbage output lines with appropriate constant input lines. To this end, parts of the circuits are re-synthesized. Experimental results show that by applying the proposed approach, the number of circuit lines can be reduced by 17% on average - in the best case by more than 40%. At the same time, the increase in the number of gates and the quantum costs, respectively, can be kept small.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523384","Optimization;Quantum Computation;Reversible Logic","Boolean functions;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Computer science;Data structures;Debugging;Logic design;Optimization methods;Quantum computing","circuit optimisation;logic design","circuit line;circuit re-synthesization;complex reversible circuit synthesis;post process optimization method;quantum computation;qubit resource;reversible logic","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among various modeling technologies underlying ESL tools, synchronous dataflow (SDF) and its related models of computation have been successfully used to model and simulate many wireless standards. However, LTE physical layer involves dynamically varying data processing rates that make SDF insufficient due to its constant-rate constraint. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Mixed-mode Vector-based Dataflow (MVDF), to efficiently model and simulate LTE physical layer by exploring the matched-rate nature of LTE and by combining static and dynamic dataflow technologies. We have implemented MVDF in an ESL tool, called SystemVue, along with a complete LTE physical layer library. With the implementation, we are able to create LTE reference designs for performance measurements. Our simulation results successfully match the standard requirements and justify the capability of MVDF.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522655","LTE physical layer;Mixed-mode dataflow","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Data processing;Design methodology;Digital signal processing;Long Term Evolution;Permission;Physical layer;Radio frequency;Wireless networks","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first introduce the concept of effective rank to select a small set of representative paths to predict the target paths with high accuracy. To handle the large dimension and degree of independent random parameter variations, we then allow modeling target path delays using segment delays and formulate it as a convex problem. The identification of segments can be incorporated in design of custom test structures to monitor PS circuit timing behavior. Simulations show that we can use the actual timing information of less than 100 paths or segments to accurately predict up to 3,500 target paths (statistically-critical ones) with more than 1,000 process variables.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523140","Post-Silicon Validation;Process Variations","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Computer aided manufacturing;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Delay;Logic gates;Predictive models;Timing","convex programming;integrated circuit design;timing","convex problem;manufacturing variation;post-silicon timing prediction;representative path selection;speedpath identification;target path delay modeling","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the insufficient accuracy of timing models for modern chip design, embedding simulation into a clock-tree synthesis flow becomes inevitable. Consequently, the runtime for clock-tree synthesis becomes prohibitively huge as the complexity of chip designs grows rapidly. To construct a buffered clock tree efficiently, we propose an ultra fast timing-model independent approach to perform skew minimization by structure optimization. To achieve the goal, a novel clock-tree structure, called symmetrical structure, is presented. At each level of a symmetrical clock tree, the number of branches, the wire-length, and the inserted buffers are almost the same. It is natural that the clock skew could be minimized if the configurations of all paths from the clock source to sinks are similar. By symmetrically constructing a clock tree, the clock skew can be minimized without referring to simulation information. Experimental results show that our approach can not only efficiently construct a buffered clock tree, but also effectively minimize clock skew with marginal wiring overheads. Based on a set of commonly used IBM benchmarks, for example, a state-of-the-art work without (with) ngspice simulation results in averagely 7.93X (2.77X) clock skew and requires 46X (24343X) runtime over our approach.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522359","","Accuracy;Chip scale packaging;Clocks;Computational modeling;Delay;Design engineering;Minimization;Runtime;Timing;Wiring","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, “small-width” Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) can have a high probability of containing no semiconducting CNTs, resulting in CNFET failures. Upsizing these vulnerable small-width CNFETs is an expensive design choice since it can result in substantial area/power penalties. This paper introduces a processing/design co-optimization approach to reduce probability of CNFET failures at the chip-level. Large degree of spatial correlation observed in directional CNT growth presents a unique opportunity for such optimization. Maximum benefits from such correlation can be realized by enforcing the active regions of CNFETs to be aligned with each other. This approach relaxes the device-level failure probability requirement by 350X at the 45nm technology node, leading to significantly reduced costs associated with upsizing the small-width CNFETs.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523507","CNT;CNT Correlation;Carbon Nanotube;Yield Optimization","CMOS technology;CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;Chemicals;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Costs;Process design;Semiconductivity;Silicon","carbon nanotubes;field effect transistors;integrated circuit yield;probability","CNFET circuit yield enhancement;CNFET failure;CNT growth;carbon nanotube correlation;chemical synthesis;chip-level;design cooptimization;device-level failure probability;size 45 nm;small-width carbon nanotube field-effect transistor;spatial correlation","","5","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At a glance, this formulation appears similar to conventional circuit clustering, but there are two important distinctions. First, we are interested in finding large groups of cells that represent entire logic structures like adders and decoders, as opposed to clusters with only a handful of cells. Second, we seek to pull out only the structures of interest, instead of assigning every cell to a cluster to reduce problem complexity. This work proposes new metrics for detecting structures based on Rent's rule that, unlike traditional cluster metrics, are able to fairly differentiate between large and small groups of cells.

Proving that a false path is valid or not is a difficult problem because of the inherent computational cost, and because in practice false paths are not specified one full path at a time. Instead designers use generalized false paths, which represent a set of paths. For instance the SDC format (Synopsys Design Constraint) specifies false path exceptions using a “-from -through -to” syntax that applies on sets of pins, often using wildcards to denote these sets. This represents many (usually hundreds to thousands) actual full paths. This paper proposes a method to verify generalized false paths in a very efficient manner. It is shown to be about 10x faster than the current state-of-the-art, making false path verification an overnight task or less for multi-million gate designs.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522565","Formal verification;SAT;SDC;co-sensitization;correctness;false path;generalized false path;sensitization;timing exception","Added delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit faults;Computational efficiency;Libraries;Logic design;Pins;Propagation delay;Timing;Twitter","","","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Maze routing is the most time-consuming process for existing global routing algorithms. This paper presents two bounded-length maze routing (BLMR) algorithms (optimal-BLMR and heuristic-BLMR) to perform much faster routing than traditional maze routing algorithms. The proposed sequential global router, which adopts a heuristic-BLMR, identifies less-wirelength routing results with less runtime than state-of-the-art global routers. This study also proposes a parallel multi-threaded collision-aware global router based on a previous sequential global router. Unlike the conventional partition-based concurrency strategy, the proposed algorithm uses a task-based concurrency strategy. Experimental results reveal that the proposed sequential global router uses less wirelength and runs about 1.9X to 18.67X faster than other state-of-the-art global routers. Compared to the proposed sequential global router, the proposed parallel global router yields almost the same routing quality with average 2.71 and 3.12-fold speedup on overflow-free and hard-to-route benchmarks, respectively, when running on an Intel quad-core system.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522604","Global routing;maze routing;multi-threaded","Algorithm design and analysis;Chaos;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Electronic design automation and methodology;Heuristic algorithms;Microprocessors;Partitioning algorithms;Routing;Runtime","","","","5","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we specifically consider the problem of virtual channel (VC) allocation in application-specific NoCs. Prior solutions to this problem have been average-rate driven. However, average-rate models are poor representations of real application traffic, and can lead to designs that are poorly matched to the application. We propose an alternate trace-driven paradigm in which configuration of NoCs is driven by application traces. We propose two simple greedy trace-driven VC allocation schemes. Compared to uniform allocation, we observe up to 51% reduction in the number of VCs under a given average packet latency constraint, or up to 74% reduction in average packet latency with same number of VCs. Our results suggest that average-rate driven methods cannot effectively select appropriate links for VC allocation because they fail to consider the impact of traffic bursts. As a case study, we compare our proposed approach with an existing average-rate driven method and observe up to 35% reduction in the number of VCs for a given target latency.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523163","Networks-on-Chip;greedy heuristics;virtual channel","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Delay;Design optimization;Fabrics;Network-on-a-chip;Permission;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Virtual colonoscopy","channel allocation;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip;optimisation","application specific multicore designs;greedy trace driven VC allocation schemes;networks-on-chip configurations;packet latency constraint;router configurations;trace driven optimization;virtual channel allocation","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the direct mapping from pixels to ISPs, the overall yield relies heavily on the correctness of the ubumps, ADCs and TSVs - a single defect leads to the information loss of a tile of pixels. This paper presents an error tolerance scheme for the 3D CMOS imager that can still deliver high quality images in the presence of μbump, ADC, and/or TSV failures. The error tolerance is achieved by properly interleaving the connections from pixels to ADCs so that the corrupted data, if any, can be recovered in the ISPs.

To overcome the influence caused by PVT variations, the automatic skew synchronization scheme can dynamically adjust and reduce the clock skew after a chip is manufactured. There are two key components in the skew synchronization scheme: Adjustable Delay Buffer (ADB) and Phase Detector (PD). Most previous researchers have emphasized on ADB placement issues. In this paper, we show that the connection between FFs and PDs can also greatly influence the final clock skew due to the insertion of the PDs. We first analyze the influence of PD connection structures. Then we propose an algorithm to generate a PD connection structure which achieves the minimum influence to the clock skew.

In this paper, we design the DualVD algorithm that efficiently computes the worst-case voltage drops in an RC power grid. Our algorithm combines a novel dual approach to solve the LP problem, and a preconditioned conjugate gradient power grid analyzer. Our dual approach exploits the structure of the problem to simplify its dual problem into a convex problem, which is then solved by the cutting-plane method.

However, routing is greatly affected by placement results. If modules with input or output ports are placed arbitrarily in a symmetry island, the routing wires, which connect these modules with other modules outside the island, may induce unwanted parasitics coupling to signals, and thus circuit performance is deteriorated. This phenomenon can not be identified by a cost function, which only considers placement area and total wire length. Therefore, we would like to introduce the necessity of considering boundary constraint for the modules with input or output ports in symmetry islands. Based on ASF-B* tree [3], we explore the feasible conditions for 1D and 2D symmetry islands to meet this constraint.

Quantifying achievable parallelism can help prevent futile programming efforts and guide innovation toward the most significant challenges. To complement Amdahl's law, we focus on stream processing and quantify performance losses due to stochastic runtimes.

In this work we will present an error analysis technique that is able to efficiently calculate the number of critical bits needed to implement each LUT. We will perform this analysis using a scalable overlapping window-based method called DCOW (Don't-care Computation with Overlapping Windows), which allows for accurate and efficient don't-care lower bound calculations. This new windowing technique can approximate the complete don't cares within 2.34%, and can be used for many logic synthesis operations. In particular, we apply DCOW to our FPGA mapping algorithm to reduce the number of possible faults.

Then, provided a flexible architecture with low run-time switching overhead, the data-flow under execution can opportunistically be tuned to provide the instantaneous computational accuracy required by the application. Thereby, the average number of operations and the precision of those is minimized. This principle is demonstrated with the implementation of the 128-point FFT present in a WLAN receiver.

Knowing open-circuit voltage (OCV) leads to SOC due to the well known mapping between OCV and SOC. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet accurate OCV algorithm that applies to all types of batteries. Using linear system analysis but without a circuit model, we calculate OCV based on the sampled terminal voltage and discharge current of the battery.

The problem to select those gates while integrity of circuit behavior remains intact has not been solved yet. We identify three constraints to solve this problem, namely functional, timing, and current constraints.

Choosing the appropriate L1 cache configuration necessitates the simulation of long memory access traces to accurately obtain hit/miss rates. The long execution time taken to simulate these traces, particularly separate simulation for each configuration is a major drawback. Researchers have proposed techniques to speed up the simulation of caches with LRU replacement policy. These techniques are of little use in the majority of embedded processors as these processors utilize Round-robin policy based caches. In this paper we propose a fast L1 cache simulation approach, called SCUD(Sorted Collection of Unique Data), for caches with the Round-robin policy. SCUD is a single-pass cache simulator that can simulate multiple L1 cache configurations (with varying set sizes and associativities) by reading the application trace once. Utilizing fast binary searches in a novel data structure, SCUD simulates an application trace significantly faster than a widely used single configuration cache simulator (Dinero IV). We show SCUD can simulate a set of cache configurations up to 57 times faster than Dinero IV. SCUD shows an average speed up of 19.34 times over Dinero IV for Mediabench applications, and an average speed up of over 10 times for SPEC CPU2000 applications.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522812","Cache simulation;L1 cache;Miss rate;Round robin;Simulation","Analytical models;Australia;Cache memory;Data structures;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Performance analysis;Permission;Process design;Round robin","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DPL attempts to decompose a single layer of one layout into two masks in order to increase pitch size and improve depth of focus (DOF). Considering DPL at detailed routing stage can improve the flexibility of layout decomposition as compared to the post-routing layout decomposition. The conflict graph proposed in [8] provides a global view of all nets in a layout to obtain a highly decomposable layout with less yield loss. However, adopting conflict graph in routing process using grid-based model or gridless model both brings huge overhead. This work presents an innovative conflict graph (ICG) to realize adopting conflict graph in a routing process. Three routing-friendly characteristics of ICG are constant-time conflict cycle detection, lazy ICG update, and light-weight routing overhead. To efficiently utilize routing resources for a crowded region, gridless models provide a better solution space than grid-based models do. This work also develops, to our knowledge, the first DPL-aware gridless detailed routing with ICG to generate a highly decomposable routing result. Moreover, greedily assigning colors for routed nets may cause unnecessary stitches or even a coloring conflict. This work presents a deferred coloring assignment-based routing flow to escape local optimum of a greedy coloring approach. Experimental results indicate that DPL-aware routing results contain no coloring conflicts, and the stitches produced by the proposed router are less than those produced by a greedy coloring approach by 41% on average with only 0.22% and 30% increment in wirelength and runtime, respectively.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523171","Detailed Routing;Double Patterning;Gridless Model","Computer science;Delay;Design optimization;Impedance;Lithography;Mesh generation;Page description languages;Routing;Ultraviolet sources;Very large scale integration","graph colouring;greedy algorithms;lithography","coloring assignment-based routing flow;constant-time conflict cycle detection;decomposable routing;depth of focus;double patterning lithography;greedy coloring;gridless detailed routing;innovative conflict graph;layout decomposition;lazy ICG update;light-weight routing overhead;next generation lithography;pitch size;recurrent delay;routing resources;routing-friendly characteristics","","4","2","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, achieving no (or low) overflow global routing solutions without strong, coordinated algorithmic control is difficult. Our algorithm addresses this challenge via a patching phase that uses IP to connect partial routing solutions. Patching provides feedback to each routing subproblem in order to avoid overflow, later when attempting to connect them. The end result is a flexible and highly scalable distributed algorithm for global routing. The method is able to accept as input target runtimes for its various phases and produce high-quality solution within these limits.

In this context, it becomes convenient to translate an existent RTL IP description, originally dedicated to implement an HW component, into pure SW code (i.e., C/C++) to be executed by one or more processors of the MPSoC.

When spatial correlation are strong (with large spatial correlation length), efficient linear time complexity analysis can be attained as the number of variational variables can be significantly reduced. However this is not the case for circuits where gate leakage currents are weakly correlated. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for statistical leakage power analysis in the presence of weak spatial correlation. The new algorithm exploits the fact that gate leakage current can be efficiently computed locally when correlation is weak. We adopt a newly proposed spatial correlation model where a new set of location-dependent uncorrelated variables are defined over virtual grids to represent the original physical random variables via fitting. To compute the leakage current of a gate on the new set of variables, the new method uses the orthogonal polynomials based collocation method, which can be applied to any gate leakage models. The total leakage currents are then computed by simply summing up the resulting orthogonal polynomials (their coefficients) on the new set of variables for all gates. Experimental results show that the proposed method is about two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed grid-based method [3] with similar accuracy and many orders of magnitude times over the Monte Carlo method.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523103","dynamic power;spatial correlation;statistical analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Gate leakage;Leakage current;Polynomials;Power dissipation;Principal component analysis;Random variables;Subthreshold current;Threshold voltage","","","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Improving the cache hit rate can have significant positive impact on the performance of an application. Modern embedded processors often feature cache locking mechanisms that allow memory blocks to be locked in the cache under software control. Cache locking was primarily designed to offer timing predictability for hard real-time applications. Hence, the compiler optimization techniques focus on employing cache locking to improve worst-case execution time. However, cache locking can be quite effective in improving the average-case execution time of general embedded applications as well. In this paper, we explore static instruction cache locking to improve average-case program performance. We introduce temporal reuse profile to accurately and efficiently model the cost and benefit of locking memory blocks in the cache. We propose an optimal algorithm and a heuristic approach that use the temporal reuse profile to determine the most beneficial memory blocks to be locked in the cache. Experimental results show that locking heuristic achieves close to optimal results and can improve the cache miss rate by up to 24% across a suite of real-world benchmarks. Moreover, our heuristic provides significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art locking algorithm both in terms of performance and efficiency.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522664","Cache;Cache Locking;Temporal Reuse Profile","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer aided instruction;Delay;Embedded computing;Embedded software;Embedded system;Optimizing compilers;Permission;Timing","cache storage;embedded systems;optimisation;program compilers;tree searching","compiler optimization techniques;embedded systems;instruction cache locking mechanism;memory access latency;software control;temporal reuse profile","","4","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we show how, by judiciously changing the internal databases used by the tool to match as much as possible the original design, one can achieve minimal impact and implement ECOs in truly incremental mode, while full-blow re-synthesis would lead to massive unnecessary downstream changes. The tool essentially matches source constructs between the original and the ECO design, and copies as many synthesis decisions as possible from the original design to the ECO design.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419798","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer bugs;Databases;Design engineering;Design methodology;Digital integrated circuits;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit synthesis;Logic design;Registers","high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","ECO design;RTL-to-GDSII design flow;digital integrated circuit design flow;engineering change orders;incremental high-level synthesis;logic netlist","","2","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, before 3D ICs become a viable technology, the 3D design space needs to be fully explored and 3D EDA tools need to be developed. To help explore the 3D design space and help fill the need for 3D EDA tools, the 3D floorplan and power/ground (P/G) co-synthesis tool is developed in this work, which develops the floorplan and the P/G network concurrently. Most current 3D IC floorplanners neglect the effects of the 3D P/G network on the design, which may lead to large IR drops in the circuit. To create feasible floorplans with efficient P/G networks, the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool optimizes the floorplan in terms of wirelength, area and P/G routing area and IR drops. The tool integrates a 3D B*-tree floorplan representation, a resistive P/G mesh, and a simulated annealing (SA) engine to explore the 3D floorplan and P/G network. The results of experiments using the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool show that 3D ICs tend to increase the P/G routing area while decreasing the IR drops in the circuit. By considering the IR drop while floorplanning, exploring the 3D P/G design space, and evaluating 3D IC's effect on 3D P/G networks, the 3D floorplan and P/G co-synthesis tool can develop a more efficient 3D IC.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419899","","Computer science;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Energy consumption;Integrated circuit synthesis;Network synthesis;Routing;Space technology;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Wires","electronic design automation;integrated circuit layout;network routing;simulated annealing;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D B*-tree floorplan;3D EDA tool;3D IC floorplan;3D design;3D integrated circuit;IR drops;P/G cosynthesis tool;P/G network;P/G routing;power/ground network cosynthesis;resistive P/G mesh;simulated annealing","","21","","20","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three-dimensional large-scale integration (3D-LSI) provides an opportunity to realize such high performance cores while reducing long latency. In this paper, we present a reference flow for the implementation of 3D via-last ICs in scalable face-to-back bonding style which leverages a mature set of 2D IC physical design tools. The first enabling technology of 3D-LSI is through-silicon via (TSV). Two kinds of TSV diameters are exemplified in the flow, namely, 5Â¿m and 50Â¿m. We propose an easy-to-adopt method to address the TSV-aware mixed-sized placement by considering the obstructions generated from adjacent-tier's floorplan, subject to certain TSV alignment constraints. Furthermore, the technique of clock tree synthesis (CTS) for a homogeneous die stack is developed to dramatically reduce the clock latency and skew. The mixed-sized placement and CTS of each tier can be done without iteration. To the best of our knowledge, no work has ever been published in literature discussing CTS for 3D via-last integration in a face-to-back fashion. Finally, to complete the proposed flow 2D timing-driven routing and modified off-line design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) verification are performed very well.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419898","","Bandwidth;Bonding;Clocks;Delay;Design automation;Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Large scale integration;Routing;Through-silicon vias","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design","2D IC physical design tools;3D large-scale integration;3D via-last integrated circuits;CAD reference flow;IC design;TSV-aware mixed-sized placement;clock tree synthesis;face-to-back bonding style;flow 2D timing-driven routing;high performance cores;homogeneous die stack;layout versus schematic verification;off-line design rule check","","4","","18","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional ASIC or SoC design floorplan usually targets for one single product; and, high efforts in re-floorplan and re-convergence for different products are still required if there is no pre-design stage multi-product planning. Therefore, the problem of designing floorplans at product or market planning stage that simultaneously optimizes multiple products, or multi-product floorplanning, is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in literature that addresses this newly emerged and financially important problem. We start with the necessary number of basic functional blocks to accommodate all the products, and pack them using a simulated annealing (SA) based floorplanner that can easily incorporate other costs (e.g., product finance weights). Given a candidate floorplan, we provide both an O(n<sup>3</sup>) exact algorithm and a O(n) greedy heuristic to identify the minimum feasible region for each product, where n is the number of basic blocks in this floorplan. These identification procedures are integrated into the SA framework to generate a floorplan that favors the configurable multi-product design.

This paper outlines a novel modeling technique called computer-aided recoding which automates the process of writing abstract models of embedded systems by use of advanced computer-aided design (CAD) techniques. Using an interactive, designer-controlled approach with automated source code transformations, our computer-aided recoding technique derives an executable parallel system model directly from available sequential reference code. Specifically, we describe three sets of source code transformations that create structural hierarchy, expose potential parallelism, and create explicit communication and synchronization. As a result, system modeling is significantly streamlined.

These techniques however may not be powerful enough, especially when spare cells are inserted in a way of striking a balance between functional and timing repair capabilities. We propose a post-mask ECO technique, called TRECO, to remedy timing violations based on technology remapping, which supports functional ECO as well. Unlike conventional technology mapping, TRECO performs technology mapping with respect to a limited set of spare cells and confronts dynamic changes of wiring cost incurred by different spare-cell selections. With a pre-computed lookup table of representative circuit templates, TRECO iteratively performs technology remapping to restructure timing critical sub-circuits until no timing violation remains.

This work presents, for the first time, a redundant-via-aware routing system to retain redundant via resources in track assignment, in which redundant vias are inserted in detailed routing. The proposed via prediction scheme performs trial route using L-shaped patterns to estimate via positions. Meanwhile, the proposed redundant-via-aware detailed router gradually relaxes the limitation on the number of generated dead vias during path searching to minimize the number of dead vias.

However, many existing applications do not have high enough parallelism to exploit multiple cores in a die, slowing the transition to many-core processors with smaller and more cores that benefit future applications with high parallelism. In this paper, we analyze the impact of multiple adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) domains on the throughput of power and thermal-constrained multi-core processors when they are combined with per-core power-gating (PCPG). Both AVS and ABB can be effectively used to either increase frequency (thus throughput) or decrease power consumption of the processors. Meanwhile, PCPG can provide extra power and thermal headroom when application's parallelism is limited. First, we analyze the throughput impact of applying AVS, ABB, and PCPG for power and thermal constrained multi-core processors. Second, we investigate the impact of multiple AVS and ABB domains on the throughput, and recommend the most cost-effective number of domains for AVS and ABB in 16 and 8-core processors. Our analysis using the 32 nm predictive technology model considering within-die variations suggests that the most cost-effective number of domains for AVS and/or ABB should be one for each when they are combined with PCPG in both 16 and 8-core processors. Since within-die core-to-core variations provide many choices in terms of core frequency and power consumption for limited-parallelism applications, one AVS or ABB domain can leads to the throughput improvement by 1.77~2.49Ã; more than one AVS and/or ABB domains only improve the throughput marginally.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419889","","Analytical models;Application software;Energy consumption;Frequency;Manufacturing processes;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Process design;Throughput;Voltage","logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","adaptive body biasing;adaptive voltage scaling;multiple ABB domain;multiple AVS domain;per-core power gating;power-constrained multicore processors;predictive technology model;size 32 nm;thermal-constrained multicore processors","","1","","23","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The min-period retiming problem seeks a solution with the minimal clock period. Since most min-period retiming algorithms assume a simple constant delay model that does not take into account many prominent electrical effects in ultra deep sub micron vlsi designs, a general delay model was proposed to improve the accuracy of the retiming optimization. Due to the complexity of the general delay model, the formulation of min-period retiming under such model is based on integer linear programming (ILP). However, because the previous ILP formulation was derived on a dense path graph, it incurred huge storage and running time overhead for the ILP solvers and the application was limited to small circuits. In this paper, we present the iRetILP algorithm to solve the min-period retiming problem efficiently under the general delay model by formulating and solving the ILP problems incrementally.

Practically the new algorithm can help designers choose the best order of the reduced model for the given frequency range and error bound via adaptive sampling scheme. As a result, it can perform wideband accurate reductions of interconnect circuits for analog and RF applications. We compare several sampling schemes such as linear, logarithmic, and recently proposed re-sampling methods. Experimental results on a number of RLC circuits show that WBMOR is much more accurate than all the other simple sampling methods and the recently proposed re-sampling scheme with the same reduction orders. Compared with the real-valued sampling methods, the complex-valued sampling method is more accurate for the same computational costs.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419924","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit noise;Computational efficiency;Costs;Error correction;Integrated circuit interconnections;RLC circuits;Radio frequency;Sampling methods;Wideband","integrated circuit interconnections;reduced order systems;sampling methods","WBMOR;adaptive complex-valued sampling method;adaptive sampling;complex valued reduction;error bound;error control problem;error estimation;exact residual errors;frequency range;interconnect circuits;sampling based reduction framework;sampling scheme;wideband model order reduction;wideband reduced modeling","","1","","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the sizing problem statistically in which transistor sizes are automatically adjusted to maximize parametric yield at a given timing performance, or maximize performance at a required parametric yield. Specifically, we describe an implementation of a statistical tuner using interior point nonlinear optimization with an objective function that is directly dependent on statistical process variation. Our results show that for process variation sensitive circuits, consisting of thousands of independently tunable devices, a statistically aware tuner can give more robust, higher yield solutions when compared to deterministic circuit tuning and is thus an attractive alternative to the Monte Carlo methods that are typically used to size devices in such circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication of a working system to optimize device sizes in custom circuits using a process variation aware tuner.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523595","Custom Circuits;Optimization","Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Delay;Digital circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Time domain analysis;Timing;Tuned circuits;Tuners","circuit optimisation;circuit tuning;gradient methods;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;transistor circuits","computer aided design;custom high performance digital circuits;deep submicron circuits;interior point nonlinear optimization;optimize device size;parametric yield considerations;process variations;statistical tuner;transistor sizing","","1","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design employs an implicit voltage reduction method that “stacks” SRAM banks in series while these blocks are inactive. No explicit DC/DC converters are required to achieve the reduced voltages, which leads to large area reductions over techniques requiring on-chip regulation circuits. This stacking technique reduces the voltage on each block close to the absolute data retention voltage (DRV) of each cell, and achieves a maximum leakage power reduction of 93% from the active power mode.

"A framework for optimizing thermoelectric active cooling systems","Jieyi Long; Memik, S.O.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2010 47th ACM/IEEE","20100726","2010","","","591","596","Thin-film thermoelectric cooling is a promising technology for mitigating heat dissipation in high performance chips. In this paper, we present an optimization framework for an active cooling system that is comprised of an array of thin-film thermoelectric coolers. We observe a set of constraints of the cooling system design. Firstly, integrating an excessive amount of coolers increases the chip package cost. Moreover, thermoelectric coolers are active devices, which dissipate heat in the chip package when they are in operation. Hence, setting the supply current level to operate the cooler improperly can actually lead to overheating of the chip package. Besides, the supply current needs to be delivered to the integrated cooler devices via dedicated pins. However, extra pins available on high-performance chip packages are limited. Observing these constraints, we propose an optimization framework for configuring the active cooling system, which minimizes the maximum silicon temperature. This includes determining the amount of coolers to deploy and their locations, the mapping of supply pins to the coolers, and determining the current levels of each pin. We propose algorithms to tackle the optimal configuration problem. We found that only a small portion of the silicon die needs to be covered by TEC devices (18% on average). Our experiments show that our algorithms are able to reduce the temperatures of the hot spots by as much as 10.6°C (compared to the cases without integrated thermoelectric coolers). The average temperature reduction is 8.6°C when 4 dedicated pins are available on the package. The total power consumption of the resulting active cooling system is reasonably small (~2 W). Our experiments also reveal that our framework maximizes the efficiency of the cooling devices. In the ideal case where hundreds of pins are available to tune the supply level of each individual cooler, the additional average reduction of the hot spot temperature is o- - nly 0.3°C.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523429","Optimization;Thermal runaway;Thermoelectric cooling","Cooling;Costs;Current supplies;Packaging;Pins;Silicon;Temperature;Thermoelectric devices;Thermoelectricity;Transistors","cooling;integrated circuit design;thermoelectric devices","chip package cost;heat dissipation;high-performance chip packages;hot spot temperature;maximum silicon temperature;optimal configuration problem;optimization framework;power consumption;supply current level;thermoelectric active cooling systems;thin-film thermoelectric cooling","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far, even though satisfying the limit of power-mode transition noise is an important design constraint, not many works have seriously addressed it as yet, just simply sacrificing the wakeup delay to meet the constraint by turning on the sleep transistors sequentially one by one. In this work, we analyze how the switching current affects the size of sleep transistors, from which how the power-mode transition noise can be mitigated by controlling the power-up sequence of sleep transistors, and propose a systematic solution to the problem of integrating the power-up controlling of sleep transistors into the power gated design flow in distributed sleep transistor network to take into account power-mode transition noise constraint as well as performance loss constraint. Through experiments with ISCAS benchmarks, it is confirmed that under the same power-mode transition noise constraint, our proposed solution is able to reduce the wakeup delay by 23% - 51% compared to the designs produced by a previous power gated design technique.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419908","","Circuit noise;Circuit synthesis;Control systems;Delay;Noise reduction;Performance analysis;Performance loss;Size control;Sleep;Turning","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;transistor circuits","distributed sleep transistor network;power gated circuit design;power gating technique;power-mode transition noise control;sleep transistors","","1","","20","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform both directed and random simulations in both coverage and simulation runtime for a variety of designs.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419814","","Analytical models;Binary decision diagrams;Computer bugs;Concrete;Engines;Runtime;State-space methods;Test pattern generators;Testing;Writing","automatic test pattern generation;constraint handling;electronic design automation;formal verification;simulation","ATCG technique;automatic target constraint generation;error-prone manual testbench composition process;guided random simulation;time-consuming manual testbench composition process","","4","","23","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the prior multi-V<sub>th</sub>/V<sub>dd</sub> optimizations are performed under deterministic conditions. With the increasing process variability that has significant impact on both the power dissipation and performance of circuit designs, it is necessary to employ statistical approaches in analysis and optimizations for low power.

A multi-V<sub>th</sub>/V<sub>dd</sub> resource library is characterized for delay and power variations at different voltage combinations. A parametric yield-driven resource binding algorithm is then proposed, which uses the characterized power and delay distributions and efficiently maximizes power yield under a timing yield constraint.

Even with an error-tolerance mechanism, scaling voltage below a critical voltage - so-called overscaling - results in more timing errors than can be effectively detected or corrected. This limits the effectiveness of voltage scaling in trading off system reliability and power. We propose a design-level approach to trading off reliability and voltage (power) in, e.g., microprocessor designs. We increase the range of voltage values at which the (timing) error rate is acceptable; we achieve this through techniques for power-aware slack redistribution that shift the timing slack of frequently-exercised, near-critical timing paths in a power- and area-efficient manner. The resulting designs heuristically minimize the voltage at which the maximum allowable error rate is encountered, thus minimizing power consumption for a prescribed maximum error rate and allowing the design to fail more gracefully. Compared with baseline designs, we achieve a maximum of 32.8% and an average of 12.5% power reduction at an error rate of 2%. The area overhead of our techniques, as evaluated through physical implementation (synthesis, placement and routing), is no more than 2.7%.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419690","","Degradation;Digital integrated circuits;Energy consumption;Error analysis;Error correction;Microprocessors;Power system reliability;Routing;Timing;Voltage","fault tolerance;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability","critical voltage;error-tolerance mechanism;graceful degradation;maximum error rate;modern digital IC designs;near-critical timing path;power-aware slack redistribution;system reliability;timing error rate;voltage overscaling;voltage scaling","","24","","29","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Statistical modeling and analysis have become the mainstay of modern design-manufacturing flows. Most analysis techniques assume that the statistical variation models are reliable. However, due to limited number of samples (especially in the case of lot-to-lot variation), calibrated models have low degree of confidence. The problem is further exacerbated when production volumes are low (Â¿ 65 lots) causing additional loss of confidence in the statistical analysis (since production only sees a small snapshot of the entire distribution). The problem of confidence in statistical analysis is going to be further worsened with advent of 450mm wafers. We mathematically derive the confidence intervals for commonly used statistical measures (mean, variance, percentile corner) and analysis (SPICE corner extraction, statistical timing). Our estimates are within 2% of simulated confidence values. Our experiments (with variability assumptions derived from test silicon data from a 45nm industrial process) indicate that for moderate characterization volumes (10 lots) and low-to-medium production volumes (15 lots), a significant guardband (e.g., 34.7% of standard deviation for single parameter corner, 38.7% of standard deviation for SPICE corner, and 52% of standard deviation for 95%-tile point of circuit delay) is needed to ensure 95% confidence in the results. The guardbands are non-negligible for all cases when either production or characterization volume is not large. We also study the interesting one production lot case which may be common for prototyping as well as for academic designs.

This paper proposes a scan-based attack which enables us to decipher a secret key in ECC. The proposed method is based on detecting intermediate values calculated in ECC. By monitoring the 1-bit sequence in the scan path, we can find out the register position specific to the intermediate value in it and we can know whether this intermediate value is calculated or not in the target ECC circuit. By using several intermediate values, we can decipher a secret key.

Unlike BDD-based methods that completely specify all pairs of SPFD using BDDs, our algorithm uses a few SAT instances to perform rewiring for a given wire without explicitly enumerating all SPFDs. Experimental results show that our algorithm's runtime is only 13% of that of a conventional one when each wire has at most 25 candidate wires and the runtime scales well with the number of candidate wires considered.

Emerging FPGA architectures, such as 6-LUTs in Xilinx Virtex-5 and 8-input ALMs in Altera Stratix-III, have a secondary LUT output that allows access to non-occupied SRAM bits. We show that this architectural feature can be used to build redundancy for fault masking with limited area and performance overhead. Our algorithm improves reliability of a mapping by performing two basic operations: duplication (in which free configuration bits are used to duplicate a logic function whose value is obtained at the secondary output) and encoding (in which two copies of the same logic function are ANDed or ORed together in the fanout of the duplicated logic). The problem of fault tolerant post-mapping resynthesis is then formulated as the optimal duplication and encoding scheme that ensures the minimal circuit fault rate w.r.t. a stochastic single fault model. We present an ILP formulation of this problem and an efficient algorithm based on generalized network flow. On MCNC benchmarks, experimental results show that for combinational circuits the proposed approach improves mean-time-to-failure(MTTF) by 27% with 4% area overhead, and the proposed approach with explicit area redundancy improves MTTF by 113% with 36% area overhead, compared to the baseline mapping by ABC.

But those methods typically gain efficiency by projecting the original system only onto one dominant subspace of the approximate system gramian (for instance using only controllability gramian). This single gramian reduction method can lead to large errors as the subspaces of controllability and observability can be quite different for general interconnects with unsymmetric system matrices. In this paper, we propose a fast balanced truncation method where the system is balanced in terms of two approximate gramians as achieved in the classical balanced truncation method. The novelty of the new method is that we can keep the similar computing costs of the single gramian method. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized SVD-based balancing scheme such that the dominant subspace of the approximate gramian product can be obtained in a very efficient way without explicitly forming the gramians. Experimental results on a number of published benchmarks show that the proposed method is much more accurate than the single gramian method with similar computing costs.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419923","","Approximation methods;Control systems;Controllability;Costs;Equations;Error correction;Integrated circuit interconnections;Large-scale systems;Observability;Reduced order systems","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;reduced order systems;singular value decomposition","SVD based balancing;double gramians approximation;fast balanced truncation method;interconnect model reduction","","1","","22","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clock wire/buffer sizing affects not only the delay/skew, but also the power dissipation of the clock tree. This effect in turn triggers changes in thermal distribution, making re-computation of the delay/skew necessary. Thus, the interaction among skew, power, and temperature is highly complicated if tied with clock wire/buffer sizing. In order to efficiently combat the time-varying nature of underlying thermal profile, we focus on two kinds of skew, depending on the number of thermal profiles given: skew value and skew range. The former refers to the skew value computed under a single steady-state thermal profile, whereas the latter refers to the skew range computed based on multiple thermal profiles. Our thermal-aware sequential-linear-programming approach maintains near-zero skew value and narrow skew range while keeping the power dissipation and temperature under the given budgets.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419835","","Clocks;Conductivity;Delay;Power dissipation;Power system reliability;Steady-state;Temperature distribution;Thermal engineering;Very large scale integration;Wire","circuit optimisation;clocks;integrated circuit design;linear programming","buffered clock tree sizing;multiple thermal profiles;power budgets;power dissipation;sequential-linear-programming;thermal budgets;thermal distribution;thermal-aware skew minimization","","2","","11","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we attempt to reduce crosstalk noise in logic and physical synthesis stage, which is usually done in post-layout stage. We propose a technology mapping method that can reduce the crosstalk noise while meeting delay constraints. The algorithm employing a dynamic programming framework in the matching phase determines the routing of fanin nets for all the matches to estimate the track utilization in probability. These routings are stored as virtual routing maps to compute the crosstalk noise during the covering phase, which will select the crosstalk-minimal solutions satisfying the delay constraints rather than the delay-minimal ones. This problem is different from wire congestion-driven technology mapping and our experimental results are encouraging. We experiment on the benchmark circuits in 90nm process, the results show that, with 7% of area increase, our proposed approach is effective to improve the crosstalk by 28% on average, as compared to the conventional delay- and/or congestion-driven technology mapping. The overall result is better than the efforts done in post-layout stage, and has been validated by modern commercial EDA tools. In addition, this proposed approach can be applied in local technology remapping at post-placement/post-routing and ECO stages as well.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419876","","Circuits;Crosstalk;Delay;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Logic programming;Phase estimation;Routing;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;circuit optimisation;crosstalk;dynamic programming;electromagnetic interference;integrated circuit noise;probability","VLSI designs;benchmark circuits;commercial EDA tools;crosstalk noise avoidance;dynamic programming;logic synthesis;physical synthesis;probability;track utilization;wire congestion-driven technology mapping","","1","","26","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the cooperative threading model employed in the SystemC reference implementation, our threading model is capable of executing in parallel on the large number of simple processing units available on GPUs. Our simulation infrastructure is called SCGPSim and it includes a source-to-source (S2S) translator to transform synthesizable SystemC models into parallelly executable programs targeting an NVIDIA GPU. The translator retains the simulation semantics of the original designs by applying semantics preserving transformations. The resulting transformed models mapped onto the massively parallel architecture of GPUs improve simulation efficiency quite substantially. Preliminary experiments with varying-sized examples such as AES, ALU, and FIR have shown simulation speed-ups ranging from 30?? to 100??. Considering that our transformations are not yet optimized, we believe that optimizing them will improve the simulation performance even further.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419903","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419903","","Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Discrete event simulation;Finite impulse response filter;Graphics;Parallel architectures;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Scheduling;Yarn","coprocessors;discrete event simulation;hardware description languages;multi-threading;parallel architectures;program interpreters","NVIDIA GPU;RTL abstraction level;SCGPSim;SystemC designs;SystemC reference implementation;SystemC simulator;concurrent threads;cooperative threading model;discrete-event simulation;general purpose graphics processors;parallel architecture;parallelly executable programs;simulation efficiency;simulation infrastructure;simulation performance;simulation semantics;source-to-source translator;synthesizable SystemC models","","17","","10","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The projected increase in the number of cores in future CMPs is putting stringent demands on the design of the on-chip network (or network-on-chip, NOC). Nanophotonic interconnects have recently emerged as a viable alternate technology solution for the design of NOC because of their higher communication bandwidth, much reduced power consumption and wiring simplification. Several photonic NOC approaches have recently been proposed. A common feature of almost all of these approaches is the integration of the entire optical network onto a single silicon waveguide layer. However, keeping the entire network on a single layer has a serious implication for power losses and design complexity due to the large amount of waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose MPNOC: a multilayer photonic networks-on-chip. MP-NOC combines the recent advances in silicon photonics and three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology with architectural innovations in an integrated architecture that provides ample bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficient on-chip communications for future CMPs. Simulation results show MPNOC can achieve 81.92 TFLOP/s peak bandwidth and an energy savings up to 23% compared to other proposed planar photonic NOC architectures.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522707","3D;CMP;Interconnection networks;Silicon photonics","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network-on-a-chip;Nonhomogeneous media;Optical fiber networks;Optical losses;Optical waveguides;Silicon;Wiring","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a promising and scalable solution for interconnecting the cores in CMPs, however it consumes significant portion of the total die area. In this paper, we propose to decouple the interconnect fabric from computing and storage layers, forming a separate layer called Interconnect Service Layer (ISL), in the context of three-dimensional (3D) chip integration. Such decoupling helps reduce the die area for each layer in 3D stacking. ISL itself can integrate multiple superimposed interconnect topologies. More importantly, ISL can be designed, manufactured, and tested as a separate Intellectual Property (IP) component, which supports multiple designs in the computing and storage layers. The resulting methodology also helps support different manufacturing volume in each die of 3D to reduce the overall manufacturing cost. We demonstrate the proposed methodology with an ISL design example and compare to its 2D and 3D counterparts without ISL support. The results show that 3D design with ISL not only provides significant cost reduction, but also achieves power-performance improvement thanks to the efficient usage of ISL.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522695","Interconnect Service Layer;Network-on-Chip;Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit","Cache memory;Cache storage;Computer aided manufacturing;Costs;Fabrics;Laboratories;Network-on-a-chip;Stacking;Sun;Through-silicon vias","","","","2","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These electrical characteristics of memristors are mainly determined by the material characteristic and the fabrication process. For example, process variations may cause the deviation of the actual electrical behavior of memristors from the original design and result in the malfunction of the device. Therefore, it is very important to understand and characterize the impact of process variations on the electrical behaviors of the memristor and its implication to the circuit design.

This is widely considered to be a very challenging problem due to the difficulty of parallel programming and the bottlenecks to efficient parallel execution. Inspired by how networking and storage systems have scaled to handle very large volumes of packet traffic and persistent data, we propose a new approach to the design of scalable, parallel computing platforms. For decades, computing platforms have gone to great lengths to ensure that every computation specified by applications is faithfully executed. While this design philosophy has remained largely unchanged, applications and the basic characteristics of their workloads have changed considerably. A wide range of existing and emerging computing workloads have an inherent forgiving nature. We therefore argue that adopting a best-effort service model for various software and hardware components of the computing platform stack can lead to drastic improvements in scalability. Applications are cognizant of the best-effort model, and separate their computations into those that may be executed on a best-effort basis and those that require the traditional execution guarantees. Best-effort computations may be exploited to simply reduce the computing workload, shape it to be more suitable for parallel execution, or execute it on unreliable hardware components. Guaranteed computations are realized either through an overlay software layer on top of the best-effort substrate, or through the use of application-specific strategies. We describe a system architecture for a best-effort computing platform, provide examples of parallel software and hardware that embody the best-effort model, and show that large improvements in performance and energy efficiency are possible through the adoption of this approach.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522827","Best effort systems;multi core;parallel computing;performance;scalability","Application software;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Scalability;Shape;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","1","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, an efficient decomposition method is developed to extract transistor threshold voltage (V<sub>TH</sub>) variations from the measurements, allowing accurate determination of SRAM cell stability. The entire approach is demonstrated in a 90 nm test chip with 32 K cells. The advantages of the proposed method include: (1) a single-ended SRAM test structure with no disturbance to SRAM operations; (2) a convenient test procedure that only requires quasi-static control of external voltages; and (3) a non-iterative method that extracts the V<sub>TH</sub> variation of each transistor from eight measurements. The new procedure enables accurate predictions of SRAM performance variability.

A major challenge with multi-core system design is the widening gap between the memory demand generated by the processor cores and the limited off-chip memory bandwidth and memory service speed. This severely restricts the number of cores that can be integrated into a multi-core system and the parallelism that can be actually achieved and efficiently exploited for not only memory demanding applications, but also for workloads consisting of many tasks utilizing a large number of cores and thus exceeding the available off-chip bandwidth. Last level shared cache partitioning has been shown to be a promising technique to enhance cache utilization and reduce missrates. While most cache partitioning techniques focus on cache miss rates, our work takes a different approach in which tasks' memory bandwidth requirements are taken into account when identifying a cache partitioning for multi-programmed and/or multithreaded workloads. Cache resources are allocated with the objective that the overall system bandwidth requirement is minimized for the target workload. The key insight is that cache miss-rate information may severely misrepresent the actual bandwidth demand of the task, which ultimately determines the overall system performance and power consumption.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522348","L2 Cache Partitioning;Off-Chip bandwidth reduction","Bandwidth;Educational institutions;Energy consumption;Hardware;Minimization methods;Multicore processing;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;System performance;Throughput","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Xetal-Pro supports ultra wide V<sub>DD</sub> scaling from nominal supply to the sub-threshold region. Although aggressive V<sub>DD</sub> scaling causes severe throughput degradation, this can be compensated by the nature of massive parallelism in the Xetal family. The predecessor of Xetal-Pro, Xetal-II, includes a large on-chip frame memory (FM), which cannot operate reliably at ultra low voltage. Therefore we investigate both different FM realizations and memory organization alternatives. We propose a hybrid memory architecture which reduces the non-local memory traffic and enables further V<sub>DD</sub> scaling. Compared to Xetal-II operating at nominal voltage, we could gain more than 10× energy reduction while still delivering a sufficiently high throughput of 0.69 GOPS (counting multiply and add operations only).

However, platform-specific timing analysis of code generated from Esterel-like specifications have mostly been neglected so far. The growing volume of electronics and software in domains like automotive, calls for formal-specification based code generation to replace manually written and optimized code. Such cost-sensitive domains require tight estimation of timing properties of the generated code. Towards this goal, we propose a scheme for generating C code from Esterel specifications for a multiprocessor platform, followed by timing analysis of the generated code. Due to dependencies across program fragments mapped onto different processors, traditional Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis techniques for sequential programs cannot applied be to this setting. Our proposed timing analysis technique is tailored to capture such inter-processor code dependencies. Our main novelty stems from how we detect and remove infeasible paths arising from a multiprocessor implementation during our timing analysis. We apply our timing analysis on a number of standard Esterel benchmarks, which show that performing the proposed inter-processor infeasible path elimination may lead to up to 14.3% tighter estimation of the WCRT, thereby leading to resource over-dimensioning and poor design.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523307","Esterel;Multiprocessor;Synchronous language;Timing analysis","Aerospace electronics;Automotive engineering;Certification;Embedded system;Performance analysis;Permission;Real time systems;Synchronization;Synchronous generators;Timing","formal specification;hardware description languages;multiprocessing systems;program compilers","Esterel benchmarks;Esterel program;code generation;cost sensitive domain;formal specification;general purpose multiprocessor;interprocessor code dependency;interprocessor infeasible path elimination;sequential programs;synchronous language;timing analysis;worst case execution time analysis technique","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This stress has been shown to be strongly layout dependent; however there is a lack of physical models relating potential performance variation to critical layout parameters. This paper presents compact closed-form models that capture the layout dependence of mechanical stress induced in the device channel while considering all relevant sources of stress (STI, tensile/compressive nitride liners, and embedded SiGe). The models are calibrated using ring oscillator frequency data obtained from an experimental test chip to verify their accuracy. Results indicate that the models accurately capture the layout dependence of stress and carrier mobility for a variety of layout permutations and the root mean square error in the predicted ring oscillator frequency is less than 1% for the different layout experiments. These models can help drive layout optimization and timing/power analysis without the use of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tools, which are slow and very limited in capacity.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522753","Mechanical Stress;Mobility;Modeling","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Compressive stress;Frequency;Germanium silicon alloys;Ring oscillators;Semiconductor device modeling;Silicon germanium;Tensile stress;Testing","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental injected error detection results are presented for the set of OSCI SystemC Example Models as well as the CHStone C High-Level-Synthesis benchmark set.

As industry moves towards many-core chips, networks-on-chip (NoCs) are emerging as the scalable fabric for interconnecting the cores. With power now the first-order design constraint, early-stage estimation of NoC power has become crucially important. Existing power models (e.g., ORION 2.0 [12], Xpipes [7], etc.) are based on certain router microarchitecture and circuit implementation. Therefore, when validated against different NoC prototypes - different router implementations - we saw significant deviation (up to 40% on average) that can lead to erroneous NoC design choices. This has prompted our development of a new, accurate architecture- and circuit implementation-independent router power and area modeling methodology with complete portability across existing NoC component libraries. Also, validation against a range of implemented router designs confirms substantial improvement in accuracy over existing models.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419887","","Circuit simulation;Libraries;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Network-on-a-chip;Parallel processing;Power measurement;Power system modeling;System-on-a-chip;Workstations","multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip","circuit implementation;computer systems;multi-core chips;networks-on-chip;on-chip router analytical area modeling;on-chip router analytical power modeling;router microarchitecture;uniprocessor chips","","4","","30","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lookahead pipeline uses the early evaluation protocol to reduce cycle period. Using the lookahead pipeline on the pipeline stages with the maximal cycle period improves the overall throughput. The router is a pure standard cell design implemented by a 0.13 Â¿m technology.

With the data-learning approach, higher correlation can be found without altering test measurements or test conditions. Rather, the approach utilizes new optimization algorithms to extract more useful information in the three test datasets, with particular success using the structural test data.

The local random mismatch is described by a noise source with an explicit dependence on geometric parameters, and is further expanded by stochastic orthogonal polynomials (SOPs). This forms a stochastic differential-algebra-equation (SDAE). To deal with large-scale problems, the SDAE is linearized at a number of snapshots along the nominal transient trajectory, and hence is naturally embedded into a trajectory-piecewise-linear (TPWL) macromodeling. The TPWL is improved with a novel incremental aggregation of subspaces identified at those snapshots. Experiments show that the proposed method, isTPWL, is hundreds of times faster than Monte-Carlo method with a similar accuracy. In addition, our macromodel further reduces runtime by up to 25X, and is faster to build and more accurate to simulate compared to existing approaches.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419894","","Analog circuits;Covariance matrix;Large-scale systems;Performance analysis;Piecewise linear techniques;Polynomials;Runtime;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance;Transient analysis","analogue circuits;circuit simulation;differential algebraic equations;piecewise linear techniques;piecewise polynomial techniques;stochastic processes","fast analog mismatch analysis;incremental stochastic trajectory piecewise linear macromodel;nonMonte-Carlo method;stochastic differential algebra equation;stochastic orthogonal polynomials","","1","","15","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis (IFRA) is a promising post-silicon bug localization technique for complex processor cores. However, applying IFRA to new processor microarchitectures can be challenging due to the manual effort required to implement special microarchitecture-dependent analysis techniques for bug localization. This paper presents the Bug Localization Graph (BLoG) framework that enables application of IFRA to new processor microarchitectures with reduced manual effort. Results obtained from an industrial microarchitectural simulator modeling a state-of-the-art complex commercial microarchitecture (Intel Nehalem, the foundation for the Intel Core™ i7 and Core™ i5 processor families) demonstrate that BLoG-assisted IFRA enables effective and efficient post-silicon bug localization for complex processors with high bug localization accuracy at low cost.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523125","BLoG;IFRA;Silicon debug;post-silicon validation","Computer bugs;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Information services;Internet;Manuals;Microarchitecture;Permission;Web sites","microprocessor chips;security of data","IFRA technique;bug localization graphs;complex processor cores;instruction footprint recording and analysis;post-silicon bug localization;processor microarchitectures","","6","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is problematic since such characteristics are heavily application dependent. In this paper, we first present autonomous schemes for detecting the change in the statistical characteristics of power and then propose adaptive schemes for capturing such new statistical parameters dynamically. This could enable accurate temperature estimation during runtime given dynamically changing power statistical states.

We then formulate a simple nonlinear optimization problem which uncovers sequentially the most relevant directions in the combined deterministic-stochastic space. The complexity of our algorithm scales with the sum (rather than the product) of the sizes of the deterministic and stochastic spaces, hence it is orders of magnitude more efficient than many of the available state of the art techniques.

A limit on the number of acceleration engines that can fit on an emulation platform creates new online problems involving runtime decisions as to when to load a SystemC process into an acceleration engine. We define the online SystemC emulation acceleration problem. In contrast to previous works that focus on statically improving SystemC (and the more general event-driven) simulations, we utilize online heuristics to manage the use of a limited number of SystemC acceleration engines in an emulation framework, where the kernel must adapt and react to dynamically changing process and event queues. We test several online heuristics and show 9x improvement over microprocessor-only emulation and 5x over statically preloaded acceleration engines. We further improve emulation performance by 10-20% by adding kernel bypass connections between acceleration engines and by adapting the online heuristics to make use of those connections.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523472","Bytecode;Emulation;Online Algorithms;Simulation;SystemC;Virtual Machines","Acceleration;Circuit synthesis;Emulation;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Image processing;Kernel;Personal communication networks;Runtime;Testing","field programmable gate arrays;simulation languages","acceleration engines;field-programmable gate arrays;in-system testing;kernel bypass connection;microprocessor-only emulation;online SystemC emulation acceleration problem;online heuristics","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed thermal management for many-core systems where balanced thermal profile can be achieved by proactive task migration among neighboring cores. The framework has a low cost agent residing in each core that observes the local workload and temperature and communicates with its nearest neighbor for task migration/exchange. By choosing only those migration requests that will result balanced workload without generating thermal emergency, the proposed framework maintains workload balance across the system and avoids unnecessary migration.

The paper addresses the following synthesis problem: how should we map literals to switches in a lattice in order to implement a given target Boolean function?

Most previous studies focus on cores and on-chip memory subsystems and discuss how to reduce their power and control thermal distribution by using dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, the on-chip interconnection network, or network-on-chip (NoC), is also an important source of power consumption and heat generation. Particularly, the traffic flowing through the NoC affects directly its power and thermal distribution. Unfortunately, very few works discuss the dynamism of NoC. A key technique for NoC management is to capture its traffic patterns and predict future behaviors. In this paper, we propose a table-driven predictor called Network Traffic Prediction Table (NTPT) for recording and predicting traffic in NoC. The most unique feature of NTPT is its ability to predict end-to-end traffic, rather than switch-to-switch traffic. Thus, more application behaviors can be captured and monitored. Evaluations on Tilera's TILE64 show that NTPT has very high prediction accuracy.

Unlike previous GPU-based algorithms that rely on good power grid regularities, the proposed algorithm can be applied for more general power grid structures.

Since TSV fill material and silicon have different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), TSV causes silicon deformation due to different temperatures at chip manufacturing and operating. The widely used TSV fill material is copper which causes tensile stress on silicon near TSV. In this paper, we propose systematic TSV stress aware timing analysis and show how to optimize layout for better performance. First, we generate a stress contour map with an analytical radial stress model. Then, the tensile stress is converted to hole and electron mobility variations depending on geometric relation between TSVs and transistors. Mobility variation aware cell library and netlist are generated and incorporated in an industrial timing engine for 3D-IC timing analysis. It is interesting to observe that rise and fall time react differently to stress and relative locations with respect to TSVs. Overall, TSV stress induced timing variations can be as much as ±10% for an individual cell. Thus as an application for layout optimization, we can exploit the stress-induced mobility enhancement to improve timing on critical cells. We show that stress-aware perturbation could reduce cell delay by up to 14.0% and critical path delay by 6.5% in our test case.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523613","3DIC;TSV;mobility variation;stress;timing analysis","Delay;Geometry;Silicon;Stacking;Tensile stress;Thermal expansion;Thermal stresses;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Through-silicon vias;Timing","electron mobility;integrated circuit layout;thermal expansion;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D wafer stacking;3D-IC layout optimization;3D-IC timing analysis;SOC integration;analytical radial stress model;chip manufacturing;coefficients of thermal expansion;copper;electron mobility variation;geometry shrinking;industrial timing engine;mobility variation aware cell library;netlist;silicon deformation;stress contour map;stress-aware perturbation;stress-induced mobility enhancement;tensile stress;through silicon via stress aware timing analysis;transistors","","16","2","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a runtime adaptive application scheduling scheme that efficiently distributes the runtime slack in a task graph, to achieve maximized performance under timing and dynamic/leakage energy constraints. A guided-search heuristics is proposed to select the best-fit frequency levels that maximize the additional program cycles of adaptive tasks.

To enhance the node-merging techniques on logic restructuring and optimization, we propose an NAR approach in this work. We first present two sufficient conditions that state the requirements of added nodes for safely replacing a target node. Then, an NAR approach is proposed to fast detect the added nodes by performing logic implications based on these conditions. We also apply the NAR approach to circuit minimization together with two techniques: redundancy removal and mandatory assignment reuse. We conduct experiments on a set of IWLS 2005 benchmarks.

CE is an advanced optimization framework which explores the power of rare-event probability theory and importance sampling. To achieve high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross entropy (SCE) algorithm is proposed which integrates CE with a partitioning-based sampling strategy to effectively reduce the dimensionality in solving the large scale decap budgeting problems. Extensive experiments on industrial power grid benchmarks show that the proposed SCE method converges 2X faster than the prior methods and 10X faster than the standard CE method, while gaining up to 25% improvement on power grid supply noise. Importantly, the proposed SCE algorithm is parallel-friendly since the simulation samples of each SCE iteration can be independently obtained in parallel. We obtain up to 1.9X speedup when running the SCE decap budgeting algorithm on a dual-core-dual-GPU system.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522930","Cross-Entropy;Decoupling Capacitor;Parallel Computing","Capacitors;Entropy;Gradient methods;Large-scale systems;Monte Carlo methods;Optimization methods;Partitioning algorithms;Power grids;Power supplies;Sampling methods","","","","0","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inter-task DVS assigns the same voltage level to all the instances of each task. Its intra-task counterpart exploits more energy savings by assigning multiple voltage levels within each task. In this paper, we propose a voltage scaling technique, named PreDVS, which assigns voltage levels based on the task set's preemptive scheduling for hard real-time systems. Our approach is based on an approximation scheme hence can guarantee to generate solutions within a specified quality bound (e.g., within 1% of the optimal) and is different from any existing inter- or intra-task DVS techniques. PreDVS exploits static time slack at a finer granularity and achieves more energy saving than inter-task scaling without introducing any extra voltage switching overhead. Moreover, it can be efficiently employed together with existing intra-task scaling techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that PreDVS can significantly reduce energy consumption and outperform the optimal inter-task voltage scaling techniques by up to 24%.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523209","Real-time systems;approximation algorithm;dynamic voltage scaling;energy-aware scheduling","Dynamic voltage scaling;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Information science;Linear approximation;Power engineering and energy;Real time systems;Runtime;Scheduling algorithm;Voltage control","approximation theory;embedded systems;optimisation;power aware computing;power consumption;processor scheduling","PreDVS;approximation scheme;dynamic voltage scaling;intertask scaling;intratask scaling;processor energy consumption;real-time systems;system optimization;voltage switching overhead","","4","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present R2, an algorithm for rewiring a post-layout LUT-based circuit that reduces the overall criticality of the circuit, where criticality is the fraction of primary inputs that lead to observable errors at the primary outputs if an single event upset inverts a configuration bit. Our algorithm explicitly optimizes the robustness of the interconnect, the dominant component of FPGAs. The key idea of R2 is to exploit Boolean flexibilities in the circuit implementation to replace wires with high criticality with those with lower criticality while preserving the circuit functionality. We estimate criticalities using a Monte Carlo fault simulation. We represent flexibilities using SPFDs (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished), and use criticality information to choose candidates for rewiring, assigning the maximum flexibility to high criticality wires. Compared to IPR, a recent robust logic optimization, our implementation increases MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) by 24%, showing for the first time, the advantages of exploiting Boolean flexibilities in optimizing for robustness. In addition, R2 achieves 5% and 2% more reduction on the number of wires and LUTs in an FPGA than that obtained by the existing rewiring algorithm for area minimization.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523111","FPGA;Logic synthesis;Rewiring;SPFD;Soft Errors","Circuit faults;Circuit synthesis;Field programmable gate arrays;Flexible printed circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic;Monte Carlo methods;Robustness;Single event upset;Wires","","","","3","","","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel.

We propose a new solution for GLC by using thermal conditioning techniques. In particular, we apply thermal control on the process of GLC, which breaks the correlations by imposing extra variations concerning gate level leakage power. The scaling factors of all the gates can be characterized by solving a system of linear equations using linear programming (LP).

First, non-volatile memories have limited number of write/erase cycles compared with DRAM memory. Second, write activities on non-volatile memory are more expensive than DRAM memory in terms of energy consumption and access latency. Both challenges will benefit from reduction of the write activities on the nonvolatile memory.

The acquired temperatures are then used to guide runtime thermal management techniques. The capabilities of these techniques are essentially bounded by the spatial thermal resolution of the sensor measurements. In this paper we characterize temperature signals of real processors and demonstrate that on-chip thermal gradients lead to sparse signals in the frequency domain. We exploit this observation to (1) devise thermal sensor allocation techniques, and (2) devise signal reconstruction techniques that fully characterize the thermal status of the processor using the limited number of measurements from the thermal sensors.

In this paper, an approach to realize compression trees on FPGAs is proposed. In case of FPGA with m-input LUT, any counters with up to m inputs can be realized with one LUT per an output. Our approach utilizes generalized parallel counters (GPCs) with up to m inputs and synthesizes high-performance compression trees by setting some intermediate height limits in the compression process like Dadda's multipliers.

Previous research has focused on implementing additional built-in circuits to measure PI linearity. In this paper, we present a cost effective PI linearity measurement technique which requires no significant modification of existing I/O circuits. Our method uses jitter distributions obtained from random jitter injected into the data channel. Two distributions are separately obtained using undersampling and sampling using PI. The proposed algorithm calculates the differential nonlinearity (DNL) from the difference of these distributions.

Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) drives process development on this front by enabling fabrication steps such as shallow juction formation that require a low thermal budget. However, decrease in junction anneal time for more aggressive device scaling has reduced the characteristic thermal length to dimensions less than the typical die size. Also, the amount of heat transferred, and hence the local anneal temperature, is affected by the layout pattern dependence of optical properties in a region. This variation in local anneal temperature causes a variation in performance and leakage across the chip by affecting the threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) and extrinsic transistor resistance (R<sub>ext</sub>). In this work, we propose a new local anneal temperature variation aware analysis framework which incorporates the effect of RTA induced temperature variation into timing and leakage analysis. We solve for chip level anneal temperature distribution, and employ TCAD based device level models for drive current (Ion) and leakage current (Ioff) dependence on anneal temperature variation, to capture the variation in device performance and leakage based on its position in the layout. Experimental results based on a 45 nm experimental test chip show anneal temperature variation of up to ~10.5Â°C, which results in ~6.8% variation in device performance and ~2.45X variation in device leakage across the chip. The corresponding variation in inverter delay was found to be ~7.3%. The temperature variation for a 65 nm test chip was found to be ~8.65Â°C.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419792","","Electronics industry;Fabrication;Heat transfer;Rapid thermal annealing;Rapid thermal processing;Temperature dependence;Temperature distribution;Testing;Threshold voltage;Timing","integrated circuit modelling;rapid thermal annealing;technology CAD (electronics);temperature distribution","characteristic thermal length;chip level anneal temperature distribution;device leakage suppression;extrinsic transistor resistance;junction anneal time;layout pattern dependence;leakage analysis;local anneal temperature variation;rapid thermal annealing;shallow juction formation;size 45 nm;technology CAD;threshold voltage;timing analysis","","3","","16","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For some timing-balanced circuits, the numbers of candidate critical paths may be very large, and this will make Monte Carlo simulation based statistical timing analysis very inefficient. A fast path selection approach based on graph partition is proposed in this paper. First, a critical path graph (CPG) is generated to implicitly enumerate almost all candidate critical paths, and then the CPG is partitioned into several sub graphs which contain limited numbers of paths using two graph partition approaches. After that, Monte Carlo simulation is applied on each sub graph for path selection. At last, according to the partition topology of the CPG and path sets selected from each sub graph, a path set for the original CPG is generated using Union and Cartesian product operations for testing SDDs. Experimental results show that for circuits containing large numbers of candidate critical paths, the proposed path selection approach can reduce the CPU time significantly and maintain a higher probability of capturing delay failures compared to path selection methods based on general Monte Carlo simulation.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419831","","Circuit testing;Computer architecture;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Distributed computing;Laboratories;Monte Carlo methods;Sampling methods;System testing;Timing","Monte Carlo methods;graph theory;integrated circuit testing;timing","Monte Carlo simulation;graph partition;path selection approach;small delay defects testing;statistical timing analysis;timing-balanced circuits","","1","","13","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that ZCTE-3D solves the problem optimally in polynomial time under the linear delay model, while it solves the problem suboptimally under the Elmore delay model. We also propose an effective 3D clock tree synthesis flow by integrating a multi-layer tree topology generation algorithm, called MMM-3D, into ZCTE-3D. Through an extensive exploitation of ZCTE-3D in experiments, we have analyzed the relation between the number of TSVs, the total wirelength, and tree topology. When compared with the results produced by the previous 3D clock tree synthesis algorithm BURITO, experimental results show that ZCTE-3D uses on average 10% less number of TSVs with similar wirelength and delay for the same tree topologies.

Because good results can be obtained after the first stage, we do not need to consider wirelength in the second stage; thus, we can devote to legalize modules. To keep the good results of the first stage, we propose a procedure to extract the geometric relations of modules from a layout and record them by constraint graphs. Then, a quadratic function as well as non-overlap and boundary constraints are formulated to determine the locations and shapes of modules.

The manifold constructed by our algorithm inherits the important property in that it covers important system responses such as DC and AC responses. It also preserves better local distance metrics on the manifold, thanks to the employment of normalized integral curve equations. To gauge the quality of the resulting manifold, we also derive an error bound of the moments of linearized systems, assuming moment-matching techniques are employed to generate low-order subspaces for linearized systems. The algorithm is also more systematic and generalizable to higher dimensions than the ad hoc procedure in. We illustrate the key ideas through a simple 2-D example.

However, when considering glitches, this is not accurate because narrow glitches consume less power than wide glitches. Glitch width and transition density modeling is further complicated by the effect of process variation. This paper presents a fast and accurate dynamic power estimation method that considers the detailed effect of process variation. First, we extend the probabilistic modeling approach to handle timing variations. Then the power consumption of a logic gate is computed based on the transition waveforms of its inputs. Both mean values and standard deviations of the dynamic power are estimated with high confidence based on accurate device characterization data. Compared with SPICE-based Monte Carlo simulations for small circuits, our power estimator reports power results within 3% error for the mean and 5% error for the standard deviation with six orders of magnitude speedup. For medium and large benchmarks, it is impossible to run Monte Carlo simulations with enough samples due to very long runtime, while our estimator can finish within minutes.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419818","","CMOS process;Circuits;Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Logic devices;Logic gates;Semiconductor device modeling;Signal processing;Timing","CMOS logic circuits;Monte Carlo methods;integrated circuit modelling;logic gates;logic simulation","CMOS circuits;SPICE-based Monte Carlo simulations;deep submicron circuits;dynamic power estimation;glitch width;logic gates;probabilistic modeling;process variation;signal transitions;timing variation;transition density modeling","","5","","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the decision for dynamic thermal management and throughput optimization only based on the temperature of each core can result in less optimal throughput in certain circumstances according to our investigation. In this paper, we propose 1) a dynamic power estimation method using a single thermal sensor for each core in multi-core processors, 2) a die temperature reconstruction method using the estimated power, and 3) a throughput optimization method based the estimated power instead of the temperature. According to our experiment using 90 nm technology, the proposed method results in less than 3% error in estimating power and hot-spot temperature of a multi-core processor.

Hence, the NoC must provide guaranteed services to some traffic streams, while maintaining low latency and high throughput of best-effort traffic. In this paper, we propose a run-time configurable NoC that enables bandwidth guarantees with minimum impact on latency for best-effort traffic. This is achieved by prioritization and distributed traffic shaping of best-effort traffic.

For developing applications on heterogeneous multicore systems, very few analysis tools exist to help the developers. This paper describes a software-based trace collection and performance analysis framework that can be ported to a variety of platforms via code instrumentation at the source level. A pure software profiling toolkit, called ParallelTracer, were implemented based on ANTLR, an open source parser generator, to support this framework. In this paper, we present our framework and toolkit. We use the IBM Cell processor as a case study to demonstrate the capability of ParallelTrace. Our results show that ParallelTracer provided useful information for programmers to understand program behaviors and identify potential performance bottlenecks via graphical visualization. We also discuss the runtime overhead of ParallelTracer. With proper usage, the performance and code size overhead introduced by our toolkit are limited around 19% to 5% and 9%, respectively, for the benchmark program in the case study.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419926","","Application software;Computer applications;Hardware;Instruments;Multicore processing;Open source software;Performance analysis;Programming profession;Software tools;Visualization","multiprocessing systems;program diagnostics;program visualisation;public domain software;software performance evaluation","ANTLR;IBM cell processor;ParallelTracer;code size overhead;computer application optimization;graphical visualization;hardware support;heterogeneous multicore systems;homogeneous multicore platforms;open source parser generator;program behaviors;software-based trace collection;trace-based performance analysis framework","","1","","12","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key challenge of DPL is to accomplish high quality decomposition for large-scale layouts under reasonable runtime with the following objectives: a) the number of stitches is minimized, b) the balance between two decomposed layers is maximized for further enhanced patterning, c) the impact of overlay on coupling capacitance is reduced for less timing variation. We use a graph theoretic algorithm for minimum stitch insertion and balanced density. An additional decomposition constraints for self-overlay compensation are obtained by integer linear programming(ILP). With the constraints, global decomposition is executed by our modified FM graph partitioning algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly scalable and fast: we can decompose all 15 benchmark circuits in five minutes in a density balanced fashion, while an ILP-based approach can finish only the smallest five circuits. In addition, we can remove more than 95% of the timing variation induced by overlay for tested structures.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419807","","Benchmark testing;Capacitance;Circuits;Large-scale systems;Lithography;Minimization;Page description languages;Partitioning algorithms;Runtime;Timing","benchmark testing;capacitance;integer programming;lithography","benchmark circuits;coupling capacitance;density balanced fashion;double patterning lithography;global decomposition;graph theoretic algorithm;integer linear programming;less timing variation;multi-objective layout decomposition framework","","29","3","15","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sequential embedded software from MRICDF specifications can be synthesized using epoch analysis, a technique proposed to form a unique order of events without a reference time line. We show how to decide on the implementability of MRICDF specification and how additional epoch information can help in synthesizing deterministic sequential software. The semantics of an MRICDF is akin to that of SIGNAL, but is visual and easier to specify. Also, our prime implicate based epoch analysis technique avoids the complex clock-tree based analysis required in SIGNAL. We experimented with the usability of MRICDF formalism by creating EmCodeSyn, our visual specification and synthesis tool.

To address this problem, two algorithms are proposed in this paper. The first one uses the integer linear programming method so that the memory access cost is minimized while tasks are scheduled in as short a time as possible. The second one is a heuristic algorithm which can achieve close to optimum results with linear running time.

One factor inhibiting SIMD code generation is control flow structure; the target scope of SIMD code generation is currently limited to single basic block or loop that consists of single basic block. SIMD instructions cannot be mapped typically across basic block boundaries even if basic blocks inside the control structure have enough parallelism. In this paper, a new compilation technique to generate SIMD code without modifying control flow structure is proposed.

The controlled-ESR is introduced to reduce the on-chip power voltage fluctuation, including both voltage drop and overshoot. We formulate an optimization problem of noise minimization with the constraint of decap budget. A revised sensitivity calculation method is derived to consider both voltage drop and overshoot. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization problem where the revised sensitivity is regarded as the gradient. Experimental results show that considering voltage drop without overshoot leads to underestimating noise by 4.8%. We also demonstrate that the controlled-ESR is able to reduce the noise by 25% with the same decap budget.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419910","","Capacitors;Circuit noise;Computational complexity;Constraint optimization;Network-on-a-chip;Noise reduction;Power supplies;Quadratic programming;Resistors;Voltage fluctuations","capacitors;circuit optimisation;electric potential;integrated circuit noise;power integrated circuits;quadratic programming;resistors","SQP algorithm;controlled-ESR;decap budget;decoupling capacitor;equivalent series resistor;noise minimization;on-chip power network optimization;on-chip power voltage fluctuation;overshoot;power network noise;sensitivity calculation;sequential quadratic programming;voltage drop","","1","","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20020806","1999","","","7 suppl.","","The Design Productivity Crisis of LSI towards 2010 have been discussed for a few years especially in SEMATECH, USA. The innovation of LSI design methodology will be the most effective way to resolve the issues of the design crisis. SIRIJ, Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan, has organized `VCDS Committee' to research the next generation EDA system towards 2010. `VCDS: Virtual Core based Design System' is proposed as the next generation EDA system to solve the issues of the design crisis. VCDS provides designers with VCs: Virtual Cores and the VC based design methodology to reduce the design time and the power consumption of system LSI for electronic systems drastically. VCDS technologies are based on hardware/software codesign and IP re-use methodologies. VCDS consists of VCDB (VC Data Base), VCPF (VC Platform), System Synthesizer and VC Synthesizer. VCDB stores high level and flexible IPs called VCs (Virtual Cores). The VCs are defined as abstract and flexible functionality at system level and are categorized by the application domains. The designer stores VCs in the VCDB by use of the registration tool of VCPF and search and instantiate them from the database via VCPF. System Synthesizer of VCDS consists of system specification definition tools, evaluation tools for hardware/software tradeoff and validation/verification, optimization tools for hardware/software codesign, the generation tools for system architecture, and the software generation tools for software compiler and software development environment. The generated system architecture consists of hardware VCs and software VCs. VC Synthesizer generates the physical design of each VC in the system architecture. VCDS is proposed as the next generation EDA system to make the solution of the coming design crisis. VCDS makes designers to define the system specification by selecting system level VCs and decide the optimum combination of hardware/software efficiently","","0-7803-5012-X","","10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760041","","Computer architecture;Design methodology;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware;Large scale integration;Productivity;Software tools;Synthesizers;Technological innovation;Virtual colonoscopy","electronic design automation;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;large scale integration;software development management","IP re-use methodologies;LSI;SEMATECH;SIRIJ;Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan;VC Synthesizer;VCDB;VCDS;VCPF;application domains;design productivity;design time;evaluation tools;hardware/software codesign;next generation EDA system;physical design;power consumption;registration tool;software development environment;software generation tools;system specification definition tools;virtual core based design system","","0","","","","","18-21 Jan 1999","18 Jan 1999-21 Jan 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses this problem and presents the first symmetrical buffered clock-tree synthesis flow that considers supply voltage differences of buffers. We employ a two-phase technique of bottom-up clock sink clustering to determine the tree topology, followed by top-down buffer placement and wire routing to complete the clock tree. At each level of processing, clock skew and wirelength are minimized by the determination of buffer embedding regions and the alignment of buffer supply voltages. Experimental results show that our method can reach, on average, respective 76% and 40% clock skew reduction compared to the state-of-the-art work (1) without supply voltage consideration and (2) with an extension for supply voltages based on our top-down flow. The reduction is achieved by marginal resource and runtime overheads. Note that our method can meet the stringent skew constraint set by the 2010 ISPD contest for all cases, while other counterparts cannot. In particular, our work provides a key insight into the importance of handling practical design issues (such as IR-drop) for real-world clock-tree synthesis.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-3029-9","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509637","","Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling;Routing;Topology;Voltage measurement;Wires","clocks;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;power supply circuits;synchronisation","bottom-up clock sink clustering;buffer supply voltage;high performance synchronous system;nonideal supply voltage;nonuniform supply voltage;supply voltage alignment;supply voltage difference;symmetrical buffered clock tree synthesis;top down buffer placement;tree topology;wire routing","","0","","32","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
