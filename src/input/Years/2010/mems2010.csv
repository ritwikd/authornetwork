In this paper, 4 × 4 MMA devices with an 88% area fill factor at normal incidence, 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm subaperture size, and single-crystal-silicon-supported mirror plates have been fabricated based on a single silicon-on-insulator wafer, without additional bonding/transfer processes. The bimorph actuators are hidden underneath the mirror plates, which are also protected by silicon walls. The MMA devices can directly be surface mounted onto driving circuit chips or printed circuit boards after fabrication. The subapertures can generate large tip-tilt-piston scanning and can individually be addressed. Static characterizations of the packaged devices show that each subaperture can achieve a piston stroke of ~310 μm and optical deflection angles greater than ±25° in both the x- and y-axes, all at 8-V dc. The preliminary laser-steering optical-phased-array capability of the obtained MMA device has also experimentally been demonstrated.

To prove the concept of propulsion, an air bubble (300 Â¿m dia. or 1.5 mm dia.) is installed on the tip of a metal rod covered with electrowetting dielectric layers. When an AC-electrowetting signal is applied between the metal rod and water medium, the bubble oscillates at the frequency of the applied signal and generates a steady streaming flow around the bubble. The streaming flow in turn generates a reaction force to the metal rod, resulting in propelling of the metal rod. The similar propulsion principle is applied to a centimeter-sized object. To the sidewalls of the object, a pair of microfabricated electrowetting electrodes with air bubbles is diagonally attached to generate a torque. When an electrowetting signal is transferred by wired or wirelessly to the electrodes, the object is rotated. These results experimentally prove that oscillating bubbles propel underwater objects, the size of which ranges from a few hundred microns to centimeters. Unlike the conventional propulsion, this technique does not need any moving solid parts, possibly providing a simple and efficient propulsion mechanism for robots swimming inside human body in applications of bio-surgery, bio-sensing and drug delivery.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-5761-8","978-1-4244-5763-2","10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5442540","","Dielectrics;Drug delivery;Electrodes;Frequency;Humans;Propulsion;Robots;Signal generators;Solids;Torque","biomechanics;propulsion;robots;underwater vehicles","AC-electro wetting;centimeter-sized object;electrowetting dielectric layers;electrowetting electrodes;metal rod;oscillating bubbles;steady streaming flow;swimming robots;underwater propulsion;water medium","","3","","7","","","24-28 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One example for such electronics integration is based on through silicon vias (TSVs) with under-bump metallization (UBM) stack for solder bumping. In this paper, we demonstrate such an approach by successfully integrating a fully populated 2D ultrasonic transducer array. Our integration is based on a previously reported TSV technology (trench-frame technology), based on trench-isolated interconnects with supporting frame. We successfully combined the trench-frame technology with a simple UBM preparation technique - electro plating or chemical plating techniques with passivation layers for UBM pad definition are not required. Our results show high shear strength (26.5 g) of the UBM, which is essential for successful flip-chip bonding. The yield of the interconnections is 100% with excellent solder-ball-height uniformity (Â¿ = 0.9 Â¿m). As demonstrated in this paper, this allows for a large-scale assembly of a tiled array by using an interposer. A design guideline for finer element-pitch design was developed suggesting that fusion bonding strength and the length of pillars are the main design parameters.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-5761-8","978-1-4244-5763-2","10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5442455","","Bonding;Chemical technology;Electronics packaging;Large-scale systems;Metallization;Passivation;Silicon;Through-silicon vias;Ultrasonic transducer arrays;Ultrasonic transducers","bonding processes;electronics packaging;electroplating;fine-pitch technology;flip-chip devices;isolation technology;passivation;semiconductor device metallisation;shear strength;ultrasonic transducer arrays","2D array devices;2D ultrasonic transducer arrays;TSV technology;UBM pad definition;UBM preparation technique;chemical plating techniques;electro plating;electronics integration;finer element-pitch design;flip-chip bonding;fusion bonding strength;large-scale assembly;packaging;passivation layers;shear strength;silicon vias;solder bumping;solder-ball-height uniformity;trench-frame technology;trench-isolated interconnects;under-bump metallization stack","","0","1","6","","","24-28 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We proposed a PDP-connection to minimize physical restrictions that cause serious problems for microactuation. A PDP-connection employs a probe electrode that is dipped into a μpool filled with a conductive, nonvolatile liquid. A PDP-connection works as a variable resistor for a potentiometer as well as low restriction wiring. The proposed potentiometer can drastically reduce the physical restrictions at the contact point of a variable resistor.

An embedded block structure is used to enhance the formation of vortices at the sudden expansion channel. The effective hydraulic diameter of the microchannel is reduced due to the formation of the vortices and it hence increases the flow resistance of the microchannel. Flow rectification can be achieved without using any moving part. The developed flow rectifier is able to work at high pressure conditions which most MEMS devices using moving parts can't sustain. Numerical and experimental investigations are used to evaluate the performance of the microfluidic rectifier.

The thin wavy sensor device can be reversibly bent and stretched up to 30% strain without any damage or performance degradation. A theoretical analysis was also developed to estimate the wavy profile.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-5761-8","978-1-4244-5763-2","10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5442318","","Bonding;Etching;Fabrication;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Silicon;Slabs;Substrates;Temperature sensors;Thermistors;Thin film devices","elastomers;silicon-on-insulator;substrates;temperature sensors;thin film devices","PDMS substrate;buckled thin film devices;elastomeric substrate;fully stretchable temperature sensor;mechanically stretchable temperature sensor;prestrained elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane substrate;silicon-on-insulator wafer;stretchable electronics","","0","","12","","","24-28 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unblocked vias are essential for creating 3D microfluidic networks. Previously reported methods either had low yield, because of residual membranes covering the vias after polymerization, or required complicated extra steps to remove the blocking membranes. In contrast, our method prevents the formation of residual membranes by inhibition of the polymerization on top of the protuding mold features defining the vias locations. In addition to providing unblocked vias, the inhibition also leaves a flat partially cured, sticky top surface that adheres well to other surfaces and allows self-sealing stacking of several PDMS layers. We demonstrate the new method by manufacturing a densely perforated PDMS membrane and a large scale integrated (LSI) 3D PDMS microfluidic channel network. Our method enables batch manufacturing of complex fluidic devices by speeding up and simplifying the fabrication of complex microfluidic components in standard PDMS.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-5761-8","978-1-4244-5763-2","10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5442520","","Biomembranes;Bonding;Clamps;Fabrication;Glass;Large scale integration;Mechanical factors;Microfluidics;Platinum;Polymers","batch processing (industrial);microfabrication;microfluidics;polymerisation;polymers","3D polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel network;batch manufacturing;blocking membrane removal;complex fluidic devices;fluidic interconnecting channels;large scale integrated 3D microfluidic networks;microfluidic fabrication;perforated polydimethylsiloxane membrane;polymerization inhibition;residual membranes;self-sealing polydimethylsiloxane layer;unblocked vias;vertical vias fabrication","","2","","8","","","24-28 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the temperature is below this range, the TSA stays off and works as a thermal insulator. Therefore, the MEMS device can quickly heat itself up to its optimal working temperature during startup. Once this temperature is reached, TSA is automatically turned on to increase the thermal conductance, working as an effective thermal spreader. As a result, the MEMS device tends to stay at its optimal working temperature without complex thermal management components and the associated parasitic power loss. The TSA is fabricated and characterized to confirm the proposed working mechanism.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-5761-8","978-1-4244-5763-2","10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5442545","","Automatic control;Energy consumption;Microelectromechanical devices;Optimal control;Switches;Switching circuits;Temperature control;Temperature distribution;Thermal conductivity;Thermal management","melting point;micromechanical devices;thermal stability","MEMS devices;low-melting-point alloy droplets;self-adaptive thermal switch array;thermal conductance;thermal spreader","","0","","5","","","24-28 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the increase in the aspect ratio of the posts may appear more revealing, the dramatic improvement in yield and uniformity is often more important for applications.
