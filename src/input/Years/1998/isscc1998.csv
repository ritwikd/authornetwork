"Performance comparison of differential static CMOS circuit topologies in SOI technology","Tretz, C.; Chuang, C.T.; Terman, L.; Pelella, M.; Zukowski, C.","IBM Thomas J. Watson Res. Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","SOI Conference, 1998. Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","123","124","This paper examines the performance of differential static CMOS circuit topologies based on partially-depleted (PD) and dual-gate SOI devices. Both device types have L/sub eff/=0.15 /spl mu/m. The top and bottom gates of the dual-gate device are self-aligned to the source/drain, and the device has a fanned-out source/drain structure with low parasitic resistance. The dual-gate device current drive and transconductance are about 2.2 times that of a partially-depleted device at the same bias. We compared three differential static CMOS topologies: (a) standard CMOS logic; (b) push-pull cascode logic (PPCL), a low power high speed static logic topology; (c) complementary pass-transistor logic (CPL), known for its efficiency for device use and popular for fast arithmetic operations. We considered three cases: (a) partially-depleted device with standard bulk-like connection where the body is tied to the supply rail; (b) partially-depleted device with floating body (FB); (c) dual gate (DG) device where the bottom gate is driven with the top gate simultaneously. Based on a methodology described previously (Tretz et al. Proc. IEEE Midwest Symp. on Circuits and Systems, pp. 179-82, 1996), performance comparison of these topologies is sufficient to establish the relative performance of almost any other differential static CMOS topology, using the generic differential CMOS static gate concept. All differential static circuits can be described as a variation of the generic differential static gate comprised of pull-up and pull-down switches, cross-coupled elements, additional resistive loads, and active paths to V/sub dd//GND.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723142","","Arithmetic;CMOS logic circuits;Circuit topology;Circuits and systems;Immune system;Logic devices;Rails;Switches;Switching circuits;Transconductance","CMOS logic circuits;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;network topology;silicon-on-insulator","0.15 micron;SOI technology;Si-SiO/sub 2/;active ground paths;arithmetic operations;bulk-like connection;complementary pass-transistor logic;cross-coupled elements;differential static CMOS circuit topologies;differential static CMOS topology;differential static circuits;dual-gate SOI devices;dual-gate device current drive;dual-gate device transconductance;fanned-out source/drain structure;generic differential CMOS static gate;generic differential static gate;parasitic resistance;partially-depleted SOI devices;partially-depleted device;partially-depleted floating body device;pull-down switches;pull-up switches;push-pull cascode logic;resistive loads;source/drain self-aligned gates;standard CMOS logic;static logic topology;supply rail-tied body","","2","8","7","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although there has been a fair amount of work published on fully-depleted SOI, little has been published on the capability of complex ULSI circuits fabricated with this technology. In this paper, we discuss the performance of a 1M SRAM fabricated on fully depleted SOI and compare it to the same design built with an epi/bulk process. Reliability effects are also examined. The 1M SRAM used was a design optimized for a radiation-hardened 3.3 V/0.5 /spl mu/m bulk production process. This radiation-hardened design has a cell size of 89 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ and a chip size of 11.6/spl times/12.0 mm. There are over 7 million transistors on the chip. This 1M SRAM design, unchanged, was built on fully-depleted SOI substrates. Fully-depleted SOI requires no body ties for SEU hardening, making a direct design mapping viable. The SOI version of this 1M SRAM was built without the cross-coupled intracell polysilicon resistors that are used in the bulk design to enhance SEU hardness.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723145","","Contracts;Electric breakdown;Isolation technology;Random access memory;Resistors;Silicon;Space vector pulse width modulation;Stress;Tellurium;Voltage","SRAM chips;ULSI;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;radiation hardening (electronics);silicon-on-insulator","0.5 micron;1 Mbit;11.6 mm;12 mm;3.3 V;SEU hardening;SEU hardness;SRAM design;SRAM performance;SRAM reliability;Si-SiO/sub 2/;ULSI circuits;body ties;cell size;chip size;cross-coupled intracell polysilicon resistors;direct design mapping;epi/bulk process;fully-depleted SOI;fully-depleted SOI SRAM;fully-depleted SOI substrates;optimized SRAM design;radiation-hardened bulk production process;radiation-hardened design;reliability effects","","0","1","","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Peregrine Semiconductor's UTSi/sup R/ silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS process is unique because it has a fully insulating substrate. This enables the design of higher performance resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The UTSi process consists of a thin (100 nm) ""improved"" silicon epitaxial layer on single crystal sapphire with dual polysilicon capacitors and three layers of Al metallization. All processing is standard CMOS processing for high manufacturability and reliability. The UTSi technology takes advantage of the sapphire substrate to improve resistor and inductor characteristics for high-performance analog and RF applications. Resistors with low parasitic capacitance, low TCR, and low voltage coefficients simplify the design of analog circuits. Highly linear double-poly capacitors also enable higher performance analog and RF design. The presence of high-Q inductors and capacitors and excellent isolation of the insulating substrate allow fully integrated MMICs to be designed in UTSi technology. These characteristics make UTSi an ideal technology for analog, RF integration, and mixed-signal products.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723130","","CMOS process;Capacitors;Inductors;Insulation;Integrated circuit technology;Isolation technology;Radio frequency;Resistors;Silicon on insulator technology;Substrates","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue integrated circuits;capacitors;field effect MMIC;inductors;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation;integrated circuit reliability;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;resistors;silicon-on-insulator","100 nm;Al;CMOS processing;RF design;SOI CMOS;Si-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/;UTSi SOS CMOS process;UTSi process;UTSi silicon-on-sapphire CMOS process;UTSi technology;analog circuits;analog design;capacitors;dual polysilicon capacitors;fully insulating substrate;fully integrated MMICs;high-Q capacitors;high-Q inductors;inductor characteristics;inductors;insulating substrate isolation;linear double-poly capacitors;manufacturability;mixed signal design;mixed-signal products;multilayer Al metallization;parasitic capacitance;passive components;reliability;resistor TCR;resistor characteristics;resistor voltage coefficients;resistors;sapphire substrate;silicon epitaxial layer;single crystal sapphire","","3","11","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There has been recent interest in the study of implanted helium and/or hydrogen induced voids in silicon. Much of this interest has stemmed from the ion-cutting techniques originally developed by Bruel (Electron. Lett. vol. 31, p. 1201, 1995). Although most of the literature on this topic has centered on the ion-cutting aspects, a few studies have concentrated on topics such as internal surface science, electronic properties, and quantum/photonic effects. Very little work has been done on controlling the size, density, and placement of these voids. In this work, we investigate the effects of annealing, co-implants, and patterned implants to study the effects on size and placement of stable voids in silicon. For the first time, we show here that void regions can be placed in precise (<0.5 /spl mu/m) locations and that void size is controllable with the appropriate annealing and implant schedules. This work provides a better understanding of the void-dislocation interactions involved and the processes of void nucleation and growth.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723097","","Annealing;Electrons;Helium;Histograms;Hydrogen;Implants;Materials science and technology;Physics;Silicon on insulator technology;Size control","annealing;dislocation interactions;elemental semiconductors;helium;hydrogen;ion implantation;nucleation;silicon;voids (solid)","Si;Si:H;Si:H,He;Si:He;annealing;annealing schedule;co-implants;electronic properties;helium implantation;helium/hydrogen co-implantation;hydrogen implantation;implant schedule;implanted helium induced voids;implanted hydrogen induced voids;internal surface science;ion-cutting techniques;patterned implants;photonic effects;quantum effects;silicon;stable voids;void density;void growth;void nucleation;void placement;void regions;void size;void size control;void spatial location control;void-dislocation interactions","","0","2","5","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","147","148","A recent study of the scalability of partially depleted (PD) SOI CMOS technology (Chau et al. IEEE IEDM Tech. Dig., p. 591, Dec. 1997) led to the conclusion that it was no better than bulk-Si CMOS for sub-0.25 /spl mu/m digital applications, irrespective of its inherent advantages, because of the higher threshold voltage (V/sub T/) needed to limit the off-state current (I/sub off/) of the nMOSFET, which tends to be high because of the drain (V/sub DS/)-induced floating-body (FB) effect (i.e. the kink effect) in addition to the barrier lowering (DIBL). In this paper, we give a physically insightful analysis of the FB effect on I/sub off/ based on the scaled PD/SOI CMOS technology described by Chau et al. which contradicts the negative assessment of the scalability of SOI digital ICs. Device and circuit simulations of operation at high chip temperatures (55-85/spl deg/C) that are typical for high-performance circuits show that the FB effect can be naturally ameliorated, and that previously proven techniques for controlling FB effects are also effective in limiting I/sub off/. Furthermore, we show that the temperature coefficient of the body-source voltage (V/sub BS/) is strongly dependent on the recombination current (I/sub R/) of the junctions, and the impact on circuit performance of an increased I/sub R/ is shown to be negligible.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723154","","CMOS digital integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Digital circuits;MOSFET circuits;Scalability;Temperature control;Temperature dependence;Threshold voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;MOSFET;circuit simulation;electric current;electron-hole recombination;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;silicon-on-insulator;thermal analysis","0.25 micron;55 to 85 C;FB effect;SOI digital ICs;Si-SiO/sub 2/;body-source voltage temperature coefficient;bulk-Si CMOS;chip temperatures;circuit performance;circuit simulations;device simulations;digital applications;drain-induced barrier lowering;drain-induced floating-body effect;junction recombination current;kink effect;nMOSFET;off-state current;off-state current control;partially depleted SOI CMOS technology;scalability;scaled PD/SOI CMOS digital circuits;scaled PD/SOI CMOS technology;threshold voltage","","3","6","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hydrogen annealing of SOI wafers (Sato and Yonehara, 1994) was originated to replace the polishing, and was traced by several groups. This novel method is advantageous in that there is no thickness reduction in principle. However, in view of the Si etching during hydrogen annealing, various etching rates have been reported in the literature, leading to the question of how much Si is consumed or how much SOI thickness reduction is suppressed. In this paper, Si etching during hydrogen annealing is investigated by using ELTRAN wafers, which are fabricated by transferring epitaxial layers on porous Si on to handle wafers.

Several processes have been developed in order to fabricate such SOI structures. These approaches can be placed in two main categories: SIMOX and wafer bonding processes. In most cases, surface quality is always a persistent and current interest for ULSI applications in terms of particles, micro-roughness, oxygen precipitates, etc. This can be easily understood as very thin gate oxide integrity is strongly related to surface micro-defects and as crystal defects in the wafer surface region deteriorate the dielectric breakdown strength of thin oxides. Some chemical mechanical polishing processes have been used for SOI fabrication processes, as have processes using epitaxial layers or plasma assisted chemical etching as a final step.

The nMOS pass-transistor based circuits with partially-depleted SOI devices offer significant performance improvement over bulk-CMOS due to the absence of reverse body effects in the floating body configuration (thus minimising the V/sub T/ loss in passing the ""high"" state and improving the driving capability).

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","109","110","The dual-gate approach to MOSFET scaling has been proposed for some time as a method of obtaining increased drive current, with potential simulated I/sub d/ values well in excess of twice that of single gate devices. In reality, approaches to fabricating such devices have suffered from an inability to align the two gates. Dual gate alignment is critical as the overlap capacitance is responsible for a large fraction of the gate delay due to the Miller effect. Alignment tolerance issues mean that the bottom gate of such a structure must be significantly oversized, and this contributes enormously to the delay through increased overlap capacitance. In this paper, a method for fabricating a dual-gate SOI MOSFET is proposed, which involves using ion cut techniques (Bruel, Electron. Lett. vol. 31, p. 1201, 1995) to bare the MOS for buried gate transistor underside processing, the use of a transparent quartz 'handle' wafer to which the delaminated structure is adhered, the use of the (now) bottom gate electrode as a hard mask for near-field lithography of the top gate, and using through-wafer illumination by g-line light to expose the poly resist. The paper presents an experimental feasibility study, as well as simulation studies to show that it is possible to expose through such a transistor stack and obtain alignment between top and bottom gates. This is then tested experimentally on patterned structures, and it is shown that it is indeed possible to obtain dual-gate alignments on repeated poly lines-and-spaces structures, with 0.3 /spl mu/m gates and 0.7 /spl mu/m spacings.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723135","","Capacitance;Delay;Electrodes;Etching;Lighting;MOSFET circuits;Packaging;Performance evaluation;Resists;Testing","MOSFET;capacitance;delays;ion implantation;masks;materials handling;photolithography;silicon-on-insulator","0.3 micron;0.7 micron;Miller effect;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Smartcut ion implantation;alignment tolerance;bottom gate electrode hard mask;buried gate transistor underside processing;delaminated structure;drive current;dual gate alignment;dual-gate MOSFET scaling approach;dual-gate SOI MOSFET;dual-gate alignment;g-line through-wafer illumination;gate delay;ion cut techniques;overlap capacitance;oversized bottom gate;patterned structures;poly resist exposure;repeated poly lines-and-spaces structures;self-aligned dual gate MOSFET structure;simulation;top gate near-field lithography;top/bottom gate alignment;transistor stack;transparent quartz handle wafer","","0","3","2","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","107","108","Scaling CMOS to sub-0.1 /spl mu/m is a formidable task, irrespective of the particular technology. Bulk-Si devices require complex channel doping variations to control short-channel effects (SCEs). Partially depleted SOI devices also require such doping, and they involve additional design consideration of the (good and bad) floating-body effects. Conventional fully depleted (FD) SOI devices are scalable only to /spl sim/0.2 /spl mu/m. However, double-gate (DG) FD/SOI devices seem to be special; Monte Carlo simulations have shown them to have excellent characteristics at the lateral or 2D integration scaling limit of /spl sim/30 nm (Frank et al. IEEE IEDM Tech. Dig., p. 553, 1992). Ideally, the DG/SOI MOSFET, with the two gates electrically coupled through the thin SOI film, offers good control of SCEs even with uniform and very low film/channel doping, high drive current and transconductance due to the gate coupling and the inherent high carrier mobility, low off-current with low threshold voltage because of the nearly ideal subthreshold slope, and other unique features shown herein. The downside of DG/CMOS is the complex processing needed to fabricate the ""near-ideal"" devices. A poignant question then is how near ideal must the devices be for their unique features to significantly benefit real scaled circuits. In this paper, we provide insight to this question via a simulation-based study of 50 nm DG/SOI CMOS devices and circuits.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723134","","CMOS technology;Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Current-voltage characteristics;Electron devices;MOS devices;Predictive models;Ring oscillators;Surface resistance;Tellurium","CMOS integrated circuits;carrier mobility;circuit CAD;circuit simulation;doping profiles;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;silicon-on-insulator","0.1 micron;0.2 micron;2D integration scaling limit;30 nm;50 nm;CMOS scalin;CMOS technology;DG/SOI CMOS circuits;DG/SOI CMOS devices;DG/SOI MOSFET;Monte Carlo simulations;SCE control;Si-SiO/sub 2/;bulk-Si devices;carrier mobility;channel doping;channel doping variations;double-gate FD/SOI devices;double-gate SOI CMOS;drive current;electrically coupled gates;film doping;floating-body effects;fully depleted SOI devices;gate coupling;lateral scaling limit;near-ideal subthreshold slope;off-current;partially depleted SOI devices;scaled circuits;short-channel effects;simulation;simulation-based performance assessment;thin SOI film;threshold voltage;transconductance","","6","","7","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","57","58","Summary form only given. LIGBT (lateral insulated gate bipolar transistor) is a promising device for smart power ICs due to its low forward voltage drop and high input impedance. Also, the SOI structure has several advantages, such as ease of isolation and low leakage currents. However, the LIGBT contains an inherent parasitic thyristor, which turns on when the voltage drop in the p/sup -/ base layer under the n/sup +/ cathode is above 0.7 V. These phenomenon is called latch-up. The FBSOA (forward biased safe operating area) of the LIGBT is limited by this latch-up phenomenon. In order to prevent latch-up, it is important to reduce the voltage drop due to hole currents. In this paper, a thin film SOI LIGBT with buried gate is proposed to suppress latch-up and is verified by numerical simulation. The buried gate and buried oxide are formed by the reverse silicon wafer direct bonding technique (Matsumoto, IEDM Tech. Dig., pp. 949-51, 1996). Also, in order to reduce the voltage drop due to the p/sup -/ base region, a p/sup +/ region is formed. This enables the proposed LIGBT with buried gate to suppress the parasitic thyristor latch-up and enlarge the FBSOA efficiently.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723109","","Cathodes;Impedance;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Leakage current;Low voltage;Numerical simulation;Power integrated circuits;Silicon on insulator technology;Thyristors;Wafer bonding","buried layers;insulated gate bipolar transistors;numerical analysis;power bipolar transistors;power integrated circuits;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;silicon-on-insulator","FBSOA;LIGBT;SOI structure;Si-SiO/sub 2/;base layer;buried gate;buried gate SOI LIGBT;buried oxide;forward biased safe operating area;forward voltage drop;hole currents;input impedance;isolation;latch-up;latch-up phenomenon;latch-up suppression;latch-up susceptibility;lateral insulated gate bipolar transistor;leakage currents;numerical simulation;parasitic thyristor;parasitic thyristor latch-up;reverse silicon wafer direct bonding technique;smart power ICs;thin film SOI LIGBT;voltage drop","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, the device threshold voltage must be lowered while maintaining low sub-threshold leakage. However, when devices are downscaled, short channel effects (SCE) and hot carrier effects (HCE) also become severe issues in SOI MOSFETs. Symmetric halo implantations are widely used in bulk MOSFETs to improve SCE. Recently, asymmetric channel implantation or ""pocket implantation"" on the source end was introduced in bulk MOSFETs to adjust the threshold voltage and improve the device SCE and HCE. In this work, for the first time, we introduce large tilt angle implantation in the SOI MOSFET to form a lateral asymmetric channel (LAC) doping profile after gate formation. High concentration channel doping near the source end reduces DIBL and threshold voltage roll-off while low doping concentration near the drain side ensures high mobility. Furthermore, the peak electric field near the drain is reduced and impact ionization is less serious compared to conventional devices. To reduce the source/drain parasitic resistance, a novel salicide technology with Ge pre-amorphization is used (Hsiao et al, IEEE SOI Conf., p. 126, 1996).","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723137","","Amorphous materials;Boron;Doping profiles;Electron devices;Los Angeles Council;MOSFETs;Silicidation;Silicon;Threshold voltage;Very large scale integration","MOSFET;amorphisation;carrier mobility;doping profiles;germanium;hot carriers;impact ionisation;ion implantation;leakage currents;semiconductor device metallisation;silicon-on-insulator","0.18 micron;DIBL;Ge pre-amorphization;Ge pre-amorphization salicide technology;SOI MOSFETs;SOI devices;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Si:Ge;asymmetric channel implantation;carrier mobility;device HCE;device SCE;device threshold voltage;drain side doping concentration;gate formation;hot carrier effects;impact ionization;large tilt angle implantation;lateral asymmetric channel doping profile;lateral asymmetric channel profile;low power applications;low voltage applications;peak electric field;pocket implantation;salicide technology;short channel effects;source-end channel doping;source/drain parasitic resistance;sub-threshold leakage;symmetric halo implantations;threshold voltage;threshold voltage roll-off","","6","","7","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circuit performance and the soft error rate of the SRAM were measured and compared with those of a 128 kb SRAM with floating-body configuration.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723144","","Board of Directors;Error analysis;MOS devices;Power dissipation;Random access memory;Testing;Threshold voltage","CMOS memory circuits;SIMOX;SRAM chips;cellular arrays;embedded systems;error analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;logic design;logic testing","0.35 micron;128 kbit;ASICs;SOI-CMOS embedded cell arrays;SOI-CMOS process;SRAM;Si-SiO/sub 2/;body-fixed structure;circuit performance;digital logic circuits;embedded cell arrays;floating-body configuration;gate arrays;high-density memories;optimized analog circuits;soft error immunity;soft error rate;synchronous SRAM","","9","1","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important issue is how to modify a baseline bulk process flow to achieve high performance SOI and bulk technology with minimal process changes. A single process flow for both PD-SOI and bulk MOS transistors is described in this paper. The performance of these devices is evaluated in terms of threshold voltage, drive current, off-current, delay times and power. In general, minimal process changes, like adjusting the threshold voltage implant dose, might be required so that the SOI transistor meets the I/sub off/ specification. SOI devices show improved short-channel behaviour and this is supported by process and device simulation.

In SOI MOSFETs, the holes (for n-channel devices) generated by impact ionization near the drain can not be properly removed as in the case of bulk MOSFETs. Due to the confinement by the buried oxide inherent in a SOI structure, the holes generated through impact ionization redistribute in the floating body and enhance the impact ionization rate near the edges of the channel, increasing with increasing device width. This is experimentally evidenced by the measured lower single transistor latch on voltages and higher linear current degradation in typical fully depleted (FD) SOI MOSFETs, and a stronger kink effect in typical partially-depleted (PD) MOSFETs, as the device width increases. It is thus suggested that more attention should be paid to the edges of the device during design and fabrication, to decrease impact ionization and/or increase carrier recombination locally. Also, in contrast to bulk technology, circuit designers must be aware that devices of different widths may have different latch-up voltages and that the hot carrier device lifetime might be underestimated if the narrow devices are tested.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723166","","Circuit testing;Current measurement;Degradation;Fabrication;Hot carriers;Impact ionization;Latches;Life testing;MOSFETs;Voltage","MOSFET;buried layers;carrier lifetime;electron-hole recombination;hot carriers;impact ionisation;semiconductor device measurement;silicon-on-insulator","SOI MOSFETs;Si-SiO/sub 2/;bulk MOSFETs;buried oxide hole confinement;carrier recombination;channel edge impact ionization;channel edges;device operation;device testing;device width;floating body;fully depleted SOI MOSFETs;hot carrier device lifetime;impact ionization;impact ionization hole generation;impact ionization rate;kink effect;latch-up voltage;linear current degradation;n-channel devices;partially-depleted SOI MOSFETs;single transistor voltage latch","","3","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Smart power devices are, for example, DMOS transistors or IGBTs that are controlled by standard MOS circuits. For high currents, these power devices are often built as vertical devices. At the Fraunhofer Institute, local SIMOX wafers are used for smart power applications to isolate the low-voltage part from the power part of the circuit dielectrically instead of the normal junction isolation (Vogt et al., 1993). In this work, a structural comparison is made between local SIMOX substrates produced by four different methods. The samples were prepared (1) by local oxygen implantation, (2) by a LOCOS process followed by wet chemical removal of the oxide, (3) by dry etching of the silicon film and the BOX, and (4) by wet chemical etching of the silicon film and the BOX.

This paper describes a novel stacked-capacitor cell structure with a simple wiring process which utilizes the virtual flat surface at the bottom of SOI stacked-capacitor cells. The virtual flat surface is made into a real surface by reversing the capacitor and polishing the substrate with bonded-SOI technology (Nishihara et al. 1992). This memory cell is named an embedded memory SOI process (EMSP)(Kim et al. 1996). In this paper, we analyze the problems of capacitor formation under an SOI structure, and confirm the process limitations to improve the embedded memory SOI process, using a 16 Mb SOI DRAM with 0.35 /spl mu/m design rule technology.

Due to their paramount importance for the development of high performance and low power/low voltage SOI CMOS technologies, SOI MOSFET short channel effects and subthreshold characteristics have been studied extensively and are now both well understood and fairly well controlled. The same is true for hot carrier effects and reliability of n-channel SOI MOSFETs. However, as with the bulk CMOS case, hot carrier studies of p-channel SOI MOSFETs have lagged behind, with only a few reports available in the open literature (Tsuchiya et al. 1994; Renn et al, 1998). This is rather surprising, since an important hot carrier induced short channel effect, hot electron induced punchthrough (HEIP), has been found to be the worst case condition in predicting the lifetime of bulk p-channel devices (Koyanagi et al. 1987). In this paper an investigation of the HEIP in p-channel SOI MOSFETs is carried out. It is found that, much like the bulk case, hot electron trapping in the gate oxide near the drain causes an effective drain extension, thereby causing a corresponding punchthrough voltage reduction. A logarithmic time dependence of this reduction is observed, in good agreement with a simple one-dimensional analytical model.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723122","","Charge carrier processes;Contracts;Hot carrier effects;Hot carriers;IEL;MOSFET circuits;Secondary generated hot electron injection;Stress;Substrate hot electron injection;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;electron traps;hot carriers;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor device testing;silicon-on-insulator","1D analytical model;HEIP effect;SOI MOSFET short channel effects;SOI MOSFET subthreshold characteristics;Si-SiO/sub 2/;bulk p-channel device lifetime;effective drain extension;gate oxide;hot carrier effects;hot carrier induced short channel effect;hot electron induced punchthrough;hot electron trapping;low power SOI CMOS technology;low voltage SOI CMOS technology;n-channel SOI MOSFETs;p-channel SOI MOSFETs;punchthrough voltage;punchthrough voltage reduction logarithmic time dependence;reliability","","0","1","10","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult to fabricate optical sensors on SOI substrates due to the limited depth of silicon available on the top film, resulting in limited photon absorption capability. To overcome such limitations, CMOS compatible devices with self-amplification have been reported (Zhang et al. 1997; Yamamoto et al. 1996). However, the amplification is still not very satisfactory.

A CW probe beam is used to monitor the acoustic waves, providing accurate measurement of acoustic frequencies and damping rates. Significantly for SOI applications, delamination of films from substrates (such as HF undercut etch pits or possibly lattice disruption resulting from an unetched dislocation) may be detected.

One is the ""HF defect"", most likely caused by ""as grown defects"" when CZ wafers are used for a top silicon layer. The second is the ""Secco (etch) defect"", which seems to be due to the final polishing process of SOI fabrication. This defect can be reduced by annealing in inert gas ambient (Aga et al. 1997). If the HF defect is genuinely related to as grown defects in CZ, one way to avoid this defect is to use an epitaxial wafer for the top layer. Another is a high temperature post-anneal after the SOI fabrication process. The latter approach may allow us to use current standard CZ as top Si. A rapid thermal process (RTP) hydrogen (H/sub 2/) anneal was investigated and it was found that anneal temperatures >1150/spl deg/C were effective for reduction of both types of defects.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723151","","Annealing;Etching;Hafnium;Hydrogen;Wafer bonding","crystal growth from melt;etching;hydrogen;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;polishing;rapid thermal annealing;silicon-on-insulator;wafer bonding","1150 C;CZ wafer top silicon layer;H/sub 2/;H/sub 2/ RTA;H/sub 2/ anneal ambient;HF defect;SOI fabrication;SOI fabrication process;Secco etch defect;Si;Si-SiO/sub 2/;anneal temperature;as grown defects;bonded SOI intrinsic defects;bonded SOI wafers;defect reduction;epitaxial wafer top layer;final polishing process;high temperature post-anneal;inert gas ambient anneal;post anneal process;rapid thermal process H/sub 2/ anneal;standard CZ top Si","","0","20","1","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, floating body effects are much reduced compared with partially-depleted devices (PD), so that they are among the best candidates for mixed analog-digital circuits in mobile wireless communication systems. However, the main concern is their manufacture with an ultra-thin silicon film (/spl sim/40 nm), which is required to obtain complete film depletion and good control of short channel effects (SCE) and barrier lowering (DIBL) at the same time, in order to obtain optimized 0.25 /spl mu/m gate length devices. To avoid a drastic increase of source/drain resistance, different solutions have already been proposed for the source/drain, including selective epitaxy, W CVD or a TiSi/sub 2/ salicide process with a very thin sputter thickness. As the TiSi/sub 2/ process is critical on ultra-thin silicon, NiSi has also been tried successfully. Nevertheless, all of these solutions must use a new nonconventional process. The recessed-channel structure (Faynot et al, IEEE Electron Dev.

For smart power devices, SOI HV device integration is an attractive technology. It allows integration of MOS controlled bipolar power transistors or thyristors and bidirectional AC power switches, with dielectric isolation between control and high potential regions. Si direct bonding was expected to be a successful VHV SOI technology, as >1 kV isolation to the handle wafer was expected for 2 /spl mu/m bonding oxide thickness. A major drawback, however, arises from the back-gate effect due to electric field extension into the SOI at high potentials, e.g. high anode voltage. An inversion channel which would shield the Si from high fields is extracted by the lateral electric field, leading to punchthrough or avalanche generation at the anode, trying to restore the channel and thus generating high blocking currents. Relatively thick SOI layers (/spl ap/20 /spl mu/m) are thus necessary to obtain devices with 500-600 V blocking capability for 220 V operation, and larger thicknesses are necessary for bidirectional AC switches. Trench isolation becomes very expensive and extension to 1 kV devices for integrated power electronic transistor drivers is not possible. We propose a new technique based on dielectric micro-barriers which enable formation of floating channel segments, based on the consideration that partial inversion channel formation shields the Si from high electric fields, when channel extraction can be prohibited, and that closely spaced channel segments have the same electrostatic effect as a continuous channel. By varying segment width, a quasicontinuous channel charge density variation can be obtained.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723110","","Anodes;Dielectrics;Electric fields;Isolation technology;Power electronics;Power transistors;Switches;Thyristors;Voltage;Wafer bonding","buried layers;carrier density;dielectric thin films;driver circuits;power integrated circuits;silicon-on-insulator","1 kV;2 micron;20 micron;220 V;500 to 600 V;MOS controlled bipolar power transistors;MOS controlled thyristors;SOI HV device integration;SOI segmented floating channel technology;Si direct bonding;Si high field shielding;Si-SiO/sub 2/;VHV SOI technology;anode voltage;avalanche generation;back-gate effect;bidirectional AC power switches;blocking capability;blocking current;bonding oxide thickness;channel extraction;closely spaced channel segments;dielectric isolation;dielectric micro-barriers;electric field extension;electric field shielding;electrostatic effect;floating channel segments;handle wafer;integrated power electronic transistor drivers;inversion channel extraction;inversion channel restoration;lateral electric field;partial inversion channel formation;punchthrough;quasicontinuous channel charge density variation;segment width;smart power devices;thick SOI layers;trench isolation techniques;very high voltage integration","","2","2","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A third terminal (gate) provides additional tuning flexibility and offers 1 pF/V sensitivity. S-parameter measurements reveal a Q of 14.

Typically, a high hydrogen dose in the 5/spl times/10/sup 16/ to 1/spl times/10/sup 17/ H ions/cm/sup 2/ range is used for implantation to achieve layer splitting. For mass production of SOI materials, the fabrication cost is one of the main challenges. A reduction of hydrogen dose is essential not only for cost-effectiveness but also for a lower defect density in the split layers. We have found that implantation of a small dose of B prior to H implantation, with the two ion profile peaks aligned, can significantly lower the blistering temperature. At a fixed splitting temperature, it implies a reduction of the required H dose for layer splitting. The B+H co-implant method has been found to work not only for Si but also for SiC, Ge and GaAs.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723152","","Application software;Gallium arsenide;Hydrogen;Low voltage;Mobile computing;Radio frequency;Silicon carbide;Silicon on insulator technology;Substrates;Temperature","doping profiles;heat treatment;ion implantation;silicon-on-insulator;wafer bonding","B low dose pre-implantation;B+H co-implant method;GaAs surface;GaAs-on-insulator substrates;GaAs:B,H;Ge surface;Ge-on-insulator substrates;Ge:B,H;H implantation;H-implanted layer splitting;RF/microwave wireless mobile communication systems;RF/microwave wireless mobile computer systems;SOI materials;SOI preparation;SOI substrates;Si surface;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Si-on-insulator substrates;Si:B,H;SiC surface;SiC-on-insulator substrates;SiC:B,H;blistering temperature;cost-effectiveness;defect density;fabrication cost;hydrogen dose;ion profile peak alignment;layer splitting;low implant dose layer splitting;mass production;semiconductor-on-insulator substrates;split layers;splitting temperature;wafer bonding","","0","1","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new lateral power device on SOI called the lateral emitter controlled thyristor (LECT) is proposed, and simulation results are presented. The LECT has better forward voltage drop (V/sub F/), larger forward biased safe operating area (FBSOA) and reverse biased safe operating area (RBSOA) than the lateral IGBT (LIGBT). LECT implementation on a thin SOI layer is suitable for smart power IC applications. The device is composed of a lateral gate-controlled PNPN thyristor in series with a short channel lateral double-diffusion MOSFET (LDMOS). The gate of the LDMOS is tied together with the turn-on gate of the thyristor to form a single control gate. A P-channel MOSFET (PMOS) is formed between the P base of the thyristor and the P-body of LDMOS, and the PMOS gate is tied to the LECT cathode. Two-dimensional simulations with MEDICI were carried out for a 300 V LECT structure to verify its operation. The forward voltage drop of the LECT and of a similar LIGBT are compared for two gate voltages. Compared at 100 A/cm/sup 2/, the V/sub F/ of the LECT is 0.4 V less than that of the LIGBT at V/sub g/=15 V, and 1 V less at V/sub g/=10 V. The results clearly show that the LECT has three distinct operating regions: a thyristor-like forward conduction region, a high voltage current saturation region, and a third region at high voltage/high current before it reaches its FBSOA point. The LECT has a much larger FBSOA than the LIGBT.

In particular, one of the key structures for high voltage, high frequency applications is the LDMOSFET. Compared to the standard junction isolation (JI) LDMOSFET, the SOI-LDMOSFET has a larger drain-substrate capacitance (C/sub dsub/) resulting from the use of the SOI substrate, which has been shown to critically influence the switching speed of the device. It is remarkable to find that PSOI technology for power LDMOSFETs, in addition to increased breakdown and reduced self-heating, is capable of giving a very low C/sub dsub/ compared to their SOI and JI counterparts, resulting in the shortest turn-off time.

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","81","82","Hot-carrier-induced degradation in SOI devices is more complex than that in bulk devices because of the SOI structure (two interfaces, floating body, etc.). At low V/sub g/, the parasitic bipolar transistor (PBT) action induced by floating body effects can reinforce the impact ionization rate as well as the device degradation. This effect can be reduced with a grounded body. However, for fully depleted (FD) SOI devices, the back interface degradation can also influence the front channel operation due to the interface-coupling effect. In this respect, the poor electrical properties of the buried oxide (BOX) of SIMOX devices could be a problem for SOI device operation in the deep sub-/spl mu/m range. A new SOI material technology, ""Smart-Cut"" was recently developed for the fabrication of Unibond wafers (Bruel et al. 1995). Good Si layer uniformity without defects and a very sharp bonded interface have been obtained from this technology. The aim of this paper is thus to present a thorough investigation of hot-carrier-induced device aging by monitoring the degradation of maximal transconductance (G/sub mmax/) and the threshold voltage (V/sub t/) shift, the charge pumping current and the noise magnitude, for deep submicron Unibond and SIMOX N-MOSFETs.

Previously, the performance of current mirrors has been improved by adopting new circuit configurations or heightening the technological level. However, this may either increase the area due to the additional devices or make the technology more critical. The gate controlled hybrid transistor (GCHT) has been proposed recently (Vandebroek et al. IEEE Trans. Electron. Dev. vol. ED-38, p. 2487, 1991; Assaderaghi et al. IEEE Trans. Electron. Dev. vol.

However, few results concerning the analog applications of GCHTs have been reported so far. This paper describes the fabrication of a high-performance current mirror using SOI GCHTs with conventional circuit configuration, investigates its characteristics in comparison with that using SOI MOSFETs, and discovers the potential of GCHTs in enhancing the performance of analog circuits while retaining the advantages of SOI technology.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723129","","Analog circuits;CMOS technology;Etching;Low voltage;MOSFET circuits;Microelectronics;Mirrors;Silicon;Threshold voltage;Voltage control","MOSFET;analogue integrated circuits;current mirrors;differential amplifiers;integrated circuit testing;silicon-on-insulator","GCHT;SOI GCHTs;SOI MOSFETs;SOI gate controlled hybrid transistor;SOI technology;Si-SiO/sub 2/;analog applications;analog circuits;bias circuits;circuit configuration;current driving capability;current gain;current mirror;differential amplifiers;gate controlled hybrid transistor;low voltage applications;subthreshold swing;switching-on voltage","","0","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an environment of rapidly advancing bulk technology, it was difficult to overcome the concern over the known and unknown risks of adopting SOI technology, as it was not known how the situation might change with future scaling.

In processing of SIMOX material, understanding the formation of the buried-oxide (BOX) layer and the effect of processing parameters is critical to production of high quality material. Most studies have focused on higher dose SIMOX material, typically 1.8/spl times/10/sup 18/ cm/sup -2/, but since the BOX is relatively thick (/spl sim/400 nm), the defects, such as Si islands, have a small effect on electrical characteristics while the density of Si pipes, which short the top Si layer and the substrate, is very low. As dose is decreased, however, the pipe density can increase with a lower dose limit at which a continuous BOX can form. Recently, Holland et al. (1996) reported that pre-amorphization of the as-implanted region prior to annealing can extend the lower limit. It was proposed that rapid diffusion of oxygen along grain boundaries in the recrystallized layer promoted formation of a continuous BOX during annealing. To examine this phenomenon, we report a comparison of microstructural development during annealing of the BOX for untreated and post-amorphized implant low-dose SIMOX.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723104","","Annealing;Implants;Physics","SIMOX;amorphisation;annealing;buried layers;crystal microstructure;grain boundary diffusion;interface structure;ion implantation;island structure;semiconductor technology","400 nm;BOX layer formation;BOX thickness;O/sub 2/;SIMOX processing;Si island defects;Si pipe defect density;Si pipe defects;Si-SiO/sub 2/;annealing;as-implanted region;buried oxide layer;buried-oxide layer formation;continuous BOX formation;electrical characteristics;low-dose SIMOX material;material quality;microstructural development;oxygen grain boundary diffusion;post-amorphized implant low-dose SIMOX;post-implantation amorphization effects;pre-amorphization;processing parameters;recrystallized layer;top Si layer-substrate shorting","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate in-situ control of the amount of implanted ions would enable the manufacturer to fine tune the dose to produce wafers with optimal and consistent BOX thickness.

GOI testing on SOI wafers is essentially different from testing on bulk, in that the wafer backside is dielectrically isolated by the buried oxide and cannot be used as an electrode. Conventional GOI testing on SOI is done on MOS structures, with a front contact on the SOI film. The fabrication is time consuming, as it requires at least four mask steps (e.g. LOCOS, gate, contact, metal) and it introduce extrinsic defects in the SOI material. There is therefore a need for a faster method, with results more directly related to the silicon film quality. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a fast GOI test for SOI wafers, needing no other structure than the oxide itself and enabling rapid feedback on a SOI process.

A bump in the subthreshold characteristic then appears, which is detrimental to circuit performance. Several solutions have been proposed for SOI nMOSFETs, including (a) additional heavy dose boron implant at the edges followed by diffusion, and (b) specially designed SOI transistors such as edgeless devices or H-gate MOSFETs. However, these solutions are not applicable to gate-all-around (GAA) transistors due to their particular structure and fabrication process. In GAA devices, the entire active area is surrounded by the gate oxide and the gate electrode, which renders the use of edgeless structures impossible. Moreover, an oxidation step is performed in order to round the transistor edges, and gate oxide is grown all around the Si island. These steps reduce transistor width and preclude the formation of a heavy boron doped diffusion zone at the edges. This paper presents a process solution which can be applied to GAA transistors in order to suppress the edge leakage problem. Simulated and experimental curves are presented, together with edge effect characterization by both I-V and charge pumping measurements. The charge pumping method requires the use of a body contacted device. Such a device has been realized for the GAA structure. The body contact is achieved through contacting the transistor body through the gate material.

There has been no soft error data reported in the papers on SOI SRAMs, except for those used for space applications. In high-density PD-SOI SRAMs, a body contact is essential to reduce soft error rates. It has been proposed that a thin well layer left between the isolation and the buried oxide can provide a convenient body contact layer that has no area penalty and is compatible with bulk CMOS (Chen et al. 1996).

We have proposed various multi-threshold CMOS/SIMOX (MTCMOS/SIMOX) circuits (Douseki et al. 1996; Fujii et al, 1998) that operate at an ultra-low supply voltage of less than 0.5 V. A triple-V/sub th/ MTCMOS/SIMOX circuit, which combines fully-depleted low- and medium-V/sub th/ CMOS logic gates and partially-depleted high-V/sub th/ power-switch transistors, makes possible fast operation in the active mode and leakage current reduction in both active and sleep modes. An advantage of the circuit is that all combinational logic gates in the conventional CMOS circuit can be easily replaced. However, upon replacing the sequential circuits, there are cases when an additional data-storage circuit is needed in order to store data in the sleep mode. The additional circuit in the critical path affects the speed in the active mode. In this paper, we describe a data-storage circuit that has the additional medium-V/sub th/ circuit in the noncritical path and does not result in any loss of speed.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723139","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Feedback circuits;Feedback loop;Frequency;Inverters;Large scale integration;Latches;MOSFET circuits;Testing","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS memory circuits;SIMOX;ULSI;combinational circuits;integrated circuit design;logic design;logic gates;sequential circuits","0.5 V;CMOS circuit;CMOS circuit technology;MTCMOS/SIMOX LSIs;Si-SiO/sub 2/;ULSIs;active mode operating speed;circuit critical path;circuit noncritical path;combinational logic gates;data-storage circuit;fully-depleted low threshold CMOS logic gates;fully-depleted medium threshold CMOS logic gates;leakage current reduction;low-voltage operation;multi-threshold CMOS/SIMOX circuits;partially-depleted high threshold power-switch transistors;sequential circuits;sleep mode;sleep mode data storage;triple-threshold CMOS/SIMOX LSIs;ultra-low supply voltage;ultra-thin-film SOI","","0","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","165","166","Summary form only given. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) on top of buried cavity structures offer many new applications in the fields of micro-sensors and actuators, micro-fluid delivery systems, and micro plasma display arrays. In active device circuits integrated with the sensors, the presence of patterned air-gaps can also lower the overall substrate and interconnect capacitance, allowing higher speed circuit operation. Existing methods of fabrication of such structures are usually based on a bonding-and-etchback technique with different etch stop methods. In many micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) applications, precision of over-layer thickness, thickness uniformity between devices, and surface microroughness are critical. The etch stop approach based on epitaxy or deep implants addresses some of the control concerns, but adds process complexity and manufacturing cost. In this paper, we report the demonstration of an effective method of forming SOI membranes over patterned cavities using the ion-cut silicon layer transfer process. The basics of this process consist of ion implantation of hydrogen into a donor wafer, followed by low temperature direct wafer bonding to the receptor wafer that has patterned trenches of various shapes and sizes. The bonded wafer pair is then heated until spontaneous silicon layer cleavage occurs along the depth corresponding to the implanted hydrogen peak concentration.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723163","","Actuators;Air gaps;Capacitive sensors;Circuits;Etching;Hydrogen;Plasma displays;Silicon on insulator technology;Substrates;Wafer bonding","brittle fracture;buried layers;cavity resonators;heat treatment;ion implantation;membranes;microactuators;microfluidics;micromachining;micromechanical resonators;microsensors;silicon-on-insulator;wafer bonding","H ion implantation;MEMS;SOI;SOI membrane formation;SOI membranes;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Si:H;bonded wafer pair;bonding-and-etchback technique;buried cavity patterns;buried cavity structures;circuit operating speed;donor wafer;etch stop methods;implanted hydrogen peak concentration depth;integrated active device circuits;interconnect capacitance;ion-cut layer transfer;ion-cut silicon layer transfer process;low temperature direct wafer bonding;manufacturing cost;micro plasma display arrays;micro-actuators;micro-electromechanical system;micro-fluid delivery systems;micro-sensors;over-layer thickness;patterned air-gaps;patterned cavities;patterned trenches;process complexity;receptor wafer;silicon-on-insulator;spontaneous silicon layer cleavage;substrate capacitance;surface microroughness;thickness uniformity","","1","6","3","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Sagamihara, Japan","SOI Conference, 1998. Proceedings., 1998 IEEE International","20020806","1998","","","139","140","Summary form only given. A Unibond/sup R/ wafer fabricated by a combination of bonding and layer splitting (Smart-Cut/sup R/) is regarded as one of the most promising silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers for next generation devices. The defect characterization of the wafer is, however, lagging because of the difficulty in measuring thin layers. In this paper, we report on the characterization of microdefects in Unibond/sup R/ wafers by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and mapping together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When an SOI wafer is excited by visible light, the light penetrates deep into the base wafer, and hence the PL is mainly from the base wafer. In contrast, UV light is predominantly absorbed in the superficial Si layer and the excited carriers are confined within this layer because of the presence of a buried oxide layer which acts as a diffusion barrier. As a result, a characteristic ""condensate luminescence"" is emitted from the superficial layer (Tajima et al. 1997). Therefore, the visible and UV excitations enable us to perform the selective detection of PL from the base wafer and the superficial Si layer, respectively. We show the presence of oxygen precipitates not only in the base wafers but in the superficial Si layers on the basis of the deep-level emission in the PL spectra, the oxygen striation pattern in the PL mapping, and the precipitate image in the TEM observations.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723150","","National electric code;Photoluminescence;Photonics Society;Silicon;Spectroscopy;Temperature;Wafer bonding","buried layers;chemical interdiffusion;diffusion barriers;flaw detection;integrated circuit measurement;light absorption;photoconductivity;photoluminescence;precipitation;silicon-on-insulator;transmission electron microscopy;ultraviolet spectra;visible spectra;wafer bonding","PL mapping;PL spectra;SOI wafer excitation;SOI wafers;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Smart-Cut process;TEM precipitate image;UV light absorption;Unibond SOI wafers;base wafer;deep-level emission;defect characterization;excited carrier confinement;excited carriers;layer splitting;microdefect characterization;oxygen precipitates;oxygen striation pattern;photoluminescence spectroscopy;silicon-on-insulator wafers;superficial Si layer;thin layer measurement;transmission electron microscopy;visible light penetration;wafer bonding;wafer defect characterization","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As device scaling approaches ever smaller regimes, multiple layer device fabrication is necessary to increase chip integration up to and beyond the gigascale regime. This paper presents multiple layer SOI (MLSOI) islands fabricated using Si SEG and ELO. The MLSOI fabrication process used was an extension of the single layer SOI island process (Neudeck et al, 1997). The first SOI layer was created by forming oxide wells via oxidation, RIE oxide etch, and re-oxidation. Adjacent to the wells, a SEG/ELO seed window is opened. SEG/ELO was grown from the seed window and laterally over the field oxide until the recessed oxide wells were filled. Excess SEG/ELO over the recess wells was removed by CMP down to the field oxide level, isolating Si in the recessed wells from the seed and thus creating SOI active device islands. The second SOI layer was similarly fabricated, but a PECVD oxide was used to create the next recessed well layer. The PECVD oxide layer wells were created by timed RIE or wet etching, but an intermediate etch stop layer can be incorporated by using LPCVD Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ prior to oxide PECVD. By repeating the fabrication process presented, additional SOI layers can be fabricated. The potential benefits of MLSOI designs are immense. Packing densities can be dramatically increased. Different device processes can be incorporated into the different MLSOI layers, e.g. making pMOSFETs on one layer and nMOSFETs on another. By designing two SRAM cells (using eight nMOSFETs and four pMOSFETs) in three Si layers with pMOSFETs in the middle layer between nMOSFET layers, area saved is about 3/spl times/.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723079","","Circuit faults;Epitaxial growth;Etching;Fabrication;MOSFETs;Oxidation;Planarization;Scanning electron microscopy;Silicon on insulator technology;Stacking","MOSFET;SRAM chips;chemical mechanical polishing;dielectric thin films;epitaxial growth;integrated circuit design;island structure;oxidation;plasma CVD;semiconductor growth;silicon-on-insulator;sputter etching","CMP;LPCVD Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ etch stop layer;MLSOI design;MLSOI fabrication process;MLSOI islands;MLSOI islands fabrication process;PECVD oxide recessed well layer;RIE oxide etch;SEG/ELO growth;SEG/ELO seed window;SOI active device islands;SOI layer;SOI layers;SRAM cells;Si ELO;Si SEG;Si layers;Si-SiO/sub 2/;SiO/sub 2/-Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/-Si;chip area saving;chip integration;device processes;device scaling;field oxide;fully-depleted SOI pMOSFETs;intermediate etch stop layer;multiple layer SOI islands;multiple layer device fabrication;nMOSFETs;oxidation;oxide wells;pMOSFETs;packing density;re-oxidation;recessed oxide well filling;recessed well Si isolation;single layer SOI island process;timed RIE;timed wet etching","","5","1","2","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the isolation process aspect, trench-isolation is the most suitable for automotive applications, because this process can handle high temperature and high voltage conditions, and can achieve high integration LSIs. High level ECU (electrical control unit) integration and fast signal processing capabilities achieved by LSIs promoted the integration of different control systems.

A significant aspect with regard to SIMOX wafers for low voltage, low power applications is the reliability and performance of the thin buried oxide. In addition, when subjected to high total dose irradiation, the silicon islands within the BOX layer of SIMOX can store charges and significantly affect the back channel threshold voltages of devices. Thus, elimination of the islands within the buried oxide (BOX) layer is preferred in order to prevent leakage through these conductive islands and charge build-up within the buried oxide layer. A differential (2-step) ramp rate as applied to full and 100 nm BOX SIMOX was previously reported to play a significant role in the stoichiometry and island formation within the buried layer (Sudou et al., 1996). This paper focuses on the properties of a thin (120 nm) buried oxide as a function of the anneal ramp rate and the anneal temperature. In this research, we have found an improvement in the buried oxide stoichiometry with the use of a slower, singular ramp rate for specified thin buried oxides, with slower ramp rates and higher anneal temperatures suggested for reduction of the presence of Si islands within the BOX layer.","1078-621X","0-7803-4500-2","","10.1109/SOI.1998.723100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723100","","Annealing;Circuits;Conference proceedings;Current measurement;Electric breakdown;Electrons;Low voltage;Power measurement;Radiation effects","CMOS integrated circuits;SIMOX;annealing;buried layers;densification;integrated circuit reliability;island structure;stoichiometry","100 nm;120 nm;BOX layer;SIMOX;SIMOX wafers;Si islands;Si-SiO/sub 2/;anneal ramp rate;anneal temperature;back channel threshold voltage;buried layer;buried oxide;buried oxide densification;buried oxide layer;buried oxide layer islands;buried oxide stoichiometry;charge build-up;conductive islands;differential ramp rate;island formation;leakage;low power CMOS applications;low voltage CMOS applications;silicon islands;stoichiometry;thin buried oxide performance;thin buried oxide reliability;total dose irradiation","","0","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 1998","05 Oct 1998-08 Oct 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More recently, results of receiver functions such as low noise amplifiers, mixers, and VCOs implemented in TFSOI have been reported (Harada et al. 1997; Dekker et al. 1997; Tseng et al. 1998). Lack of a successful demonstration of a power amplifier has been one element preventing implementation of a complete TFSOI RF transceiver. This paper reports the results of the first demonstration of power amplifiers on TFSOI, using n-channel RF MOSFET devices.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819888","","Circuits;Microcontrollers;Power amplifiers;Power supplies;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Random access memory;Semiconductor device manufacture;Voltage;Wireless communication","UHF field effect transistors;UHF power amplifiers;mobile radio;power MOSFET;silicon-on-insulator;transceivers","ALUs;DRAM;RF downconversion;SRAM;Si-SiO/sub 2/;TFSOI;TFSOI RF transceiver;TFSOI technology;VCOs;digital microcontrollers;low noise amplifiers;low power digital baseband circuits;microcontroller CPUs;mixers;n-channel RF MOSFET devices;portable wireless communication applications;power amplifiers;process technology;receiver functions;semiconductor manufacture;single chip solution;supply power;supply voltage;thin-film-silicon-on-insulator technology","","3","","8","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet this demand, silicon on insulator (SOI) has become of major interest for next generation devices, because it can offer durable device scaling as compared with bulk devices (Schepis et al. 1997). The critical issues for SOI are floating-body effects such as deterioration in drain current (Matsumoto et al. 1999), dynamic threshold voltage instability (Lu et al. 1997), and increased soft error rate (Wada et al. 1998). These have restricted the application of floating SOI, especially to analog circuits. Some circuit modifications and body contact insertions are necessary. A full body-fixing structure is another approach and some techniques have been proposed (Koh et al. 1997; Iwamatsu et al. 1995). However, when using these techniques, there have been some shortcomings in terms of scalability and layout compatibility. In this report, we propose a partial trench isolation (PTI) technique in which the body potential is fixed through the region under the trench oxide. With the PTI technology, we can eliminate floating-body effects while maintaining SOI-inherent merits and can realize scalable deep sub-quarter micron LSIs using accumulated bulk-design properties without layout modification. Moreover, the feasibility for ULSIs is demonstrated by a fully functional 4 Mbit SRAM.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819887","","Analog circuits;Error analysis;Intelligent systems;Isolation technology;Random access memory;Scalability;Silicon on insulator technology;Threshold voltage;Transistors;Ultra large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;SRAM chips;ULSI;integrated circuit layout;isolation technology;silicon-on-insulator","0.18 micron;4 Mbit;PTI technology;SOI;SRAM;Si-SiO/sub 2/;ULSIs;accumulated bulk-design properties;analog circuits;body contact insertions;body potential;body-fixed partial trench isolation;body-fixing structure;bulk-layout-compatible SOI-CMOS technology;circuit modifications;device scaling;drain current;dynamic threshold voltage instability;floating SOI;floating-body effects;intelligent system LSIs;layout compatibility;layout modification;partial trench isolation;scalability;silicon on insulator;soft error rate;transistor performance;trench oxide","","2","36","6","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fully-depleted (FD) SOI transistors, they cause a strong DIBL enhancement and a parasitic back channel conduction. On the other hand, in partially-depleted (PD) devices, the back channel control is even more difficult. The understanding and modeling of this phenomenon is of major interest, especially for RF SOI applications on high resistivity substrates where the depleted substrates behave as dielectrics. Various solutions to reduce these drawbacks are envisaged, such as buried oxide shrinking or double gate devices (Colinge, 1997; Cristoloveanu and Li, 1995). Thus far, the fringing field effect was ignored or merely included in FD analytical models by use of adjustable parameters. This paper presents a simple physical model for the evaluation of short channel effects induced by the BOX and substrate depletion. We analyze the lateral drain field penetration in the BOX and substrate, and calculate the related fringing capacitances. The model serves to anticipate the buried oxide scaling and substrate resistivity effects and to suggest the ""ground plane"" (GP) concept (Ernst and Cristoloveanu, 1999; Wong et al, 1998) as a suitable architecture for deep sub-micron SOI MOSFETs.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819847","","Analytical models;Capacitance;Conductivity;Dielectric substrates;Linear predictive coding;MOSFET circuits;Microelectronics;Radio frequency;Semiconductor films;Silicon","MOSFET;buried layers;capacitance;dielectric thin films;electric fields;electrical resistivity;semiconductor device models;silicon-on-insulator","0.1 micron;BOX layer;DIBL enhancement;FD SOI transistors;FD analytical models;PD SOI devices;RF SOI applications;SOI MOSFET architecture;SOI MOSFET channel length reduction;SOI device architecture;SOI device scaling;Si-SiO/sub 2/;back channel control;buried oxide;buried oxide fringing capacitance;buried oxide scaling effects;buried oxide shrinking;depleted substrates;double gate devices;fringing capacitance;fringing field effect;fringing fields;fully-depleted SOI transistors;ground plane concept;high resistivity substrates;lateral drain field penetration;modeling;parasitic back channel conduction;partially-depleted SOI devices;physical model;short channel effects;substrate depletion;substrate depletion region;substrate resistivity effects","","15","","5","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been reported that the thin film fully-depleted (FD) SOI structure is promising for low voltage, high speed applications due to the improved short channel tolerance and lack of body effect (Wong et al, 1998). However, current techniques to obtain bulk-like quality material for very thin SOI have proved difficult to manufacture in terms of cost, material defects and SOI thickness variation across the wafer. The SOI thickness variation results in V/sub T/ variation, which is a major drawback in FD-SOI technology. Selective epitaxial growth (SEG) offers an alternative way of obtaining a device quality SOI material when it is grown laterally (epitaxial lateral overgrowth; ELO) over the field SiO/sub 2/. The local area chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) etch stop gives good controlled thickness of uniform thin SOI films where FD-SOI MOSFETs can be fabricated (Pae et al, 1998 and 1999). One distinctive advantage of the ELO technique is the formation of very thin bottom gate SiO/sub 2/ for double gate MOSFETs (Wong et al. 1997; Denton et al. 1995), which is difficult to obtain in other SOI technologies. This enables improved dynamic V/sub T/ control using low back gate bias. We report here the most recent results of deep-submicron FD-SOI P-MOSFETs fabricated in two different layers of SOI islands created entirely by ELO. Device characteristics and dynamic V/sub T/ shifting are discussed.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819876","","Application software;Dielectric measurements;Dielectric substrates;Epitaxial growth;Etching;Fabrication;Low voltage;MOSFET circuits;Manufacturing;Thin film devices","MOSFET;chemical mechanical polishing;dielectric thin films;epitaxial growth;etching;island structure;semiconductor growth;silicon-on-insulator","100 nm;ELO;FD-SOI MOSFETs;FD-SOI P-MOSFETs;FD-SOI technology;SEG;SOI film thickness control;SOI islands;SOI technology;SOI thickness variation;Si-SiO/sub 2/;back gate bias;body effect;bulk MOSFETs;bulk-like quality material;chemical mechanical polishing;device characteristics;device quality SOI material;device scaling;double-gate MOSFETs;dynamic threshold voltage shifting;epitaxial lateral overgrowth;field SiO/sub 2/ layer;high speed applications;local area CMP etch stop;material defects;multi-layer SOI island technology;selective epitaxial growth;short channel tolerance;single-gate MOSFETs;thin SOI;threshold voltage variation;uniform thin SOI films;very thin bottom gate SiO/sub 2/","","1","","6","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Propagation delay versus active power can be greatly reduced by using fully-depleted (FD) devices, because threshold voltage (V/sub t/) and junction capacitance (increased by halo implant in case of bulk and PD devices) are lower. However, this advantage is possible only if transconductance is not degraded by high S/D resistance and if SCE and DIBL are well controlled, essentially by reducing silicon thickness. Furthermore, sensitivity of electrical parameters to silicon thickness (tsi) for FD devices is often mentioned as a critical process issue due to SOI substrate thickness nonuniformity. In this paper, we show (with both 2D simulations and measurements) that V/sub t/ control can be improved by a low energy S/D implant for enhancement-mode (EM) devices. S/D resistance can also be maintained at a low enough level by using a recessed-channel process, which allows the proper reduction of tsi exactly under the gate (Raynaud et al., 1998). Using a TiSi/sub 2/ salicide process on gate and elevated S/D regions, we have measured a maximum oscillation frequency f/sub max/ of 48 GHz at 0.9 V for 0.25 /spl mu/m NMOS. Finally, we show that, due to a balance between different physical effects, the distribution of critical parameters for digital applications (saturation and off currents, propagation delay and power consumption) is not degraded by silicon thickness nonuniformity.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819865","","CMOS technology;Capacitance;Degradation;Electrical resistance measurement;Implants;Propagation delay;Scalability;Silicon;Threshold voltage;Transconductance","CMOS integrated circuits;capacitance;circuit simulation;delays;electric resistance;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit metallisation;silicon-on-insulator","0.13 micron;0.25 micron;0.9 V;1 to 1.2 V;2D simulations;48 GHz;CMOS generation;DIBL;NMOS technology;SCE;SOI substrate thickness nonuniformity;SOI technology scalability;Si-SiO/sub 2/;TiSi/sub 2/;TiSi/sub 2/ salicide process;active power;critical parameters;critical process issue;digital applications;electrical parameters;elevated S/D regions;enhancement-mode devices;fully-depleted SOI technology;fully-depleted devices;gate regions;halo implant;junction capacitance;low energy S/D implant;maximum oscillation frequency;measurements;off currents;partially-depleted devices;physical effects;power consumption;propagation delay;recessed-channel process;saturation currents;scalability;sensitivity;silicon thickness;silicon thickness nonuniformity;source-drain resistance;threshold voltage;threshold voltage control;transconductance","","1","1","2","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We applied a ring oscillator for the voltage controlled-oscillator (VCO). The well-known issues of SOI do not affect the circuit stability and noise performance of our PLL circuit for several reasons. Firstly, as the frequency range required for the VCO is comparatively narrow, the floating-body configuration would have little effect on circuit operation (Ueda et al., 1996). Secondly, thermal equilibrium on the ring oscillator can be achieved within a few microseconds (Tenbroek et al., 1998). Then the self-heating issue would be insignificant for the lock-in process of the PLL. Besides this, the buried oxide of SOI and shallow trench isolation reduces the crosstalk noise from the large digital logic block which is the most potentially serious problem for system-level integration of sensitive circuits and large logic blocks.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819834","","CMOS technology;Crosstalk;Isolation technology;Logic circuits;Phase locked loops;Ring oscillators;Substrates;Thin film circuits;Thin film devices;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;circuit stability;field effect MMIC;integrated circuit noise;isolation technology;phase locked loops;silicon-on-insulator;telecommunication equipment;voltage-controlled oscillators","0.18 micron;1.8 V;2.5 GHz;PLL;PLL circuit;PLL lock-in process;SOI/CMOS technology;Si-SiO/sub 2/;VCO;VCO frequency range;active devices;buried oxide;circuit operation;circuit stability;crosstalk noise;digital logic block;floating-body SOI/CMOS chip;floating-body configuration;high-speed communication devices;logic blocks;noise performance;ring oscillator;self-heating;sensitive circuits;shallow trench isolation;shallow trench isolation structure;system-level integration;thermal equilibrium;thin film SOI substrate;voltage controlled-oscillator","","0","","4","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SOI technology has been proven to be advantageous in many applications compared with conventional bulk technology. However, image sensor integration on SOI substrates suffers from low quantum efficiency, which inhibits the development of SOI imaging systems. To overcome the barrier, CMOS compatible devices with self-amplification have been reported (Zhang et al. 1998; Yamamoto et al. 1996). However, the use of the high gain properties required a stable process and an accurate model for predicting the output, which are both not yet available. In this paper, we have investigated the performance of a hybrid active pixel structure. In this approach, the photodiode is built on the bottom substrate, while the reset transistor and the in-pixel amplifying transistor are built on the top silicon film. The performance of the APS is expected to be similar to the bulk technology, with potentially higher speed due to the lower capacitance that the photodiode has to drive in SOI technology. However, as a minimal deviation from the conventional SOI CMOS process is used to fabricate the APS, the photodiode is less optimized than current bulk technology. The operation of the APS in different configurations under different light intensities was studied and is reported.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819873","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Image sensors;Manufacturing;Photodiodes;Pixel;Semiconductor device modeling;Substrates","CMOS image sensors;capacitance;integrated circuit technology;photodiodes;silicon-on-insulator","APS configurations;APS performance;CCD technology;CMOS active pixel sensors;CMOS compatible devices;CMOS imager;CMOS manufacturing technology;SOI CMOS process;SOI imaging systems;SOI substrate;SOI substrates;SOI technology;Si-SiO/sub 2/;capacitance;functionality;gain properties;hybrid active pixel structure;hybrid active pixels;image sensor integration;imaging applications;in-pixel amplifying transistor;light intensity;photodiode;quantum efficiency;reset transistor;self-amplification;sensor integration;sensor power;stable process;top silicon film","","1","4","4","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much of this interest stems from the two-channel property of the symmetrical-gate DG device and the implied higher current drive. More important, we believe, is the electrical coupling of the two gates through the FD Si film. This coupling underlies the inherent suppression of SCEs and the excellent subthreshold slope, which translate to high I/sub on//I/sub off/ ratios. In fact, as we show in this paper, the coupling can be exploited more in asymmetrical-gate DG MOSFETs (Fossum and Chong, 1998; Tanaka et al. 1994) than in symmetrical ones. We rely on numerical device simulations, using MEDICI and its hydrodynamic-transport option, and SOISPICE circuit simulations, using the UFSOI/FD MOSFET model (Fossum et al. 1998), to convey insight regarding performance and optimal design of DG MOSFETs and to reveal the inherent superiority of asymmetrical gates.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819871","","Application specific integrated circuits;CMOS integrated circuits;Circuit simulation;Couplings;Doping;MOSFETs;Medical simulation;Semiconductor films;Surface resistance;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;SPICE;electric current;numerical analysis;semiconductor device models;silicon-on-insulator","20 nm;CMOS IC applications;FD Si film;MEDICI;SCE suppression;SOISPICE circuit simulation;Si-SiO/sub 2/;UFSOI/FD MOSFET model;asymmetrical gates;asymmetrical-gate DG MOSFETs;current drive;double-gate MOSFETs;effective channel length;electrical coupling;fully depleted SOI bodies;fully depleted Si-film bodies;hydrodynamic-transport option;lateral scaling limit;near-ideal intrinsic features;numerical device simulation;on/off current ratios;optimal design;subthreshold slope;symmetrical gates;symmetrical-gate DG MOSFETs;symmetrical-gate DG device;two-channel property","","4","2","7","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such a situation, it may be desirable to have those parts of the circuits that can take advantage of SOI fabricated separately from the other circuits on bulk Si. The traditional approach is a multichip module (MCM), with sub-units fabricated on the appropriate substrate. This can add considerably to the cost and complexity of the final product. An elegant alternative approach is a patterned SOI wafer. Such a wafer has bulk Si areas interspersed with SOI areas, or ""pads"", of desired dimensions. Several technologies have been proposed for fabrication of such wafers (Van Bentum and Vogt, 1998). Perhaps the most promising of them is patterned SIMOX. SIMOX has emerged as a mature processing technology for the production of SOI wafers. Prior to design of device layouts, it is important to take into consideration the type, density, and location of crystalline defects which might be present in the region of transition from bulk Si to the SOI pads.

Portable applications, remote applications and consumer products are all driving the need for reduced power consumption. Battery based systems are becoming much more prevalent and consumers do not wish to sacrifice performance. Thus minimizing power consumption is a very hot topic and the focus of this technical session. The session begins with a fabricated MPU design exhibiting very low power consumptiion using a multi-threshold scheme with separation by silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. A novel ultra low voltage differential technology with adjustable threshold voltages (and current-mirror and current-inverter applications using floating gate transistors) is presented. High level synthesis scheduling for multiple supply voltages is then presented. Another multiple supply voltage scheme is shown taking advantage of dual supply rails to all cells and proper scheduling of which rail is used for each cell. This scheme saves power at minimal cost of area and timing. Ultra low-power supply voltages below 1V introduce constraints not seen at higher supply voltages. A new MOSFET model is then presented that provides insight into the on/off current interdependence which becomes critical with voltage scaling. A new conditional-sum addition rule for low power applications is then presented. Next paper presents design technique for very low power applied to Speech Codec in the Personal Digital Cellular Phone. The final paper of this session outlines a PC-on-a-chip system using multi-chip package technology.

The SOI substrate is especially robust in this case due to the low power nature originating from the reduced junction capacitances. To achieve the high operating frequency that is required in RF applications, it is important to have high transconductance, and this can be realized by reducing the gate length. However, shortening the gate length could meanwhile increase the gate resistance and thus degrade the unit power gain frequency. While the gate resistance can be reduced by using thicker silicide, this approach is not feasible wherever shallow junctions exist, as in the case of SOI and sub-0.1 /spl mu/m MOSFETs. In this regard, the polysilicon spacer gate structure (Kun H. To et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 1997) can provide the best solution. This structure, however, imposes a great problem for drain engineering when high performance is needed. In this work, a large tilt angle implant is proposed to implement the drain engineering. Due to the buried oxide, the drain junction depth is well controlled by the silicon film thickness and thus the short channel behaviour can be suppressed by using thinner Si films.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819869","","CMOS logic circuits;Capacitance;Costs;Logic circuits;MOSFETs;Radio frequency;Robustness;Semiconductor films;Substrates;Wireless communication","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;buried layers;capacitance;doping profiles;electric resistance;elemental semiconductors;field effect MMIC;ion implantation;microwave field effect transistors;silicon;silicon-on-insulator","0.1 micron;RF CMOS;RF applications;SOI MOSFETs;SOI polysilicon spacer gate MOSFETs;SOI substrate;Si-SiO/sub 2/;buried oxide;drain engineering;drain junction depth;gate length;gate resistance;junction capacitance;large angle tilted implant drain engineering;large tilt angle implant;logic circuit compatibility;operating frequency;polysilicon spacer gate structure;shallow junctions;short channel behaviour;silicide thickness;silicon film thickness;transconductance;unit power gain frequency;wireless communications","","3","","3","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For conventional high temperature Ti salicidation, however, it is difficult to control silicide formation due to a fast reaction rate between Ti metal and silicon. Co silicide can achieve low sheet resistance for fine polysilicon lines and source/drain (S/D) regions, but the diode leakage is still a major problem with shallower junctions and SOI for deep sub-micron CMOS (Hsiao et al., 1998). In the past, a low temperature silicide technology has been proposed and applied to 100-nm SOI MOSFETs (Goto et al., 1995). In this paper, Ge/sup +/ pre-amorphized Ti salicide for sub-0.1 /spl mu/m gate length CMOS is investigated in detail and is used to demonstrate 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS on an ultra thin SOI film of 35 nm for the first time. We focused on the influence of Ge/sup +/ pre-amorphization energy, Ti metal thickness and substrate doping on Ti silicidation kinetics, silicide depth and sheet resistance on bulk and fine polysilicon lines ranging from 1.0 to 0.1 /spl mu/m. Our results showed an effective control of silicide depth in the case of Ge/sup +/-implanted samples. A small grain size averaging 80 nm was observed on fine gate lines and polysilicon lines down to 0.1 m were shown to have good resistivity. The effects of metal thickness and doping species were eliminated. The excellent device performance shows this technology is highly suitable for future 0.1 /spl mu/m SOI MOSFETs and deep sub-micron bulk CMOS devices.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819866","","CMOS technology;Diodes;Doping;Kinetic theory;MOSFETs;Silicidation;Silicides;Silicon;Substrates;Temperature control","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;amorphisation;doping profiles;electrical resistivity;germanium;grain size;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation;ion implantation;reaction kinetics;silicon-on-insulator;titanium compounds","0.1 micron;0.1 to 1 micron;0.18 micron;35 nm;CMOS device dimensions;CMOS gate length;CMOS on ultra-thin SOI;Co silicide;Ge/sup +/ pre-amorphization energy;Ge/sup +/ pre-amorphized Ti salicide;Ge/sup +/-implanted samples;SOI MOSFETs;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Ti metal thickness;Ti silicidation kinetics;TiSi/sub 2/:Ge;bulk CMOS devices;bulk polysilicon lines;controllable thin silicide formation;device performance;diode leakage;doping species;fine gate lines;fine polysilicon lines;grain size;high temperature Ti salicidation;low temperature silicide technology;metal thickness;polysilicon lines;reaction rate;resistivity;sheet resistance;silicide;silicide depth;silicide formation;source/drain regions;substrate doping;ultra thin SOI film","","0","1","4","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A variety of approaches to produce low-dose SIMOX have been used which include: low dose implant plus ITOX (internal thermal oxidation), which uses a second high temperature anneal with high oxygen concentration (Nakashima et al. 1996; Mrstik et al. 1995); multiple energy implants (Alles, 1997); lower energy implantation (Anc et al. 1998); rapid ramping to the high temperature anneal range (Ogura, 1998); N pre-implantation (Meyappan et al. 1995); and very-low dose, post-implant amorphization prior to high temperature annealing (Holland et al. 1996; Bagchi et al. 1997). For the last technique, it was reported there were changes in the precipitation mechanisms that control BOX development. The first was elimination of multiply-faulted defects as sites for preferred nucleation and growth of oxides which form a discontinuous upper layer of precipitates in untreated material.

Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International","20020806","1999","","","32","33","Summary form only given. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology has proven to be compatible with bulk CMOS in many ways, ranging from circuit design and layout to wafer processing. In addition, partially-depleted (PD) SOI technology has been suggested as a method for achieving a high circuit performance at low supply voltage and low power (Jacobs et al, 1998). Unlike fully-depleted (FD) SOI transistors, PD SOI devices have the advantage of a threshold voltage V/sub T/ which is insensitive to variations in the silicon thickness uniformity. Based on device physics, the long-channel threshold voltage V/sub T/ is equal to the V/sub T/ of the bulk transistor as long as the channel doping concentrations are equal. Therefore, PD SOI CMOS design appears to be very similar to conventional bulk. Often, the design of a PD SOI CMOS technology is started from a present and well-known baseline bulk CMOS technology. During device fabrication, it is assumed, however, that the diffusivity of the channel dopants in the vertical direction in SOI is similar to bulk, which is fundamentally incorrect. In order to investigate the threshold voltage difference between PD SOI and bulk, SOI CMOS transistors have been fabricated on BESOI wafers with buried oxide and silicon layer thicknesses of 350 and 125 nm, respectively. In order to obtain a straight comparison with the bulk CMOS technology, each SOI wafer has a bulk counterpart for which the process conditions have been exactly the same.","1078-621X","0-7803-5456-7","","10.1109/SOI.1999.819844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819844","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuit optimization;Circuit synthesis;Doping;Jacobian matrices;Low voltage;Physics;Silicon on insulator technology;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;buried layers;circuit simulation;diffusion;doping profiles;etching;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit measurement;low-power electronics;silicon-on-insulator;wafer bonding","125 nm;350 nm;BESOI wafers;PD SOI CMOS design;PD SOI CMOS technology design;PD SOI devices;SOI CMOS technology;SOI CMOS transistors;SOI wafer;Si-SiO/sub 2/;baseline bulk CMOS technology.;bulk CMOS technology;bulk CMOS transistors;bulk transistor threshold voltage;buried oxide thickness;channel doping concentrations;circuit design;circuit layout;circuit performance;device fabrication;device physics;diffusivity;dopant diffusion;fully-depleted SOI transistors;long-channel threshold voltage;low power circuit;partially-depleted SOI CMOS transistors;partially-depleted SOI technology;process conditions;silicon layer thickness;silicon thickness uniformity;silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology;supply voltage;threshold voltage;threshold voltage design incompatibility;threshold voltage difference;vertical channel dopants;wafer processing","","0","","6","","","4-7 Oct. 1999","04 Oct 1999-07 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
