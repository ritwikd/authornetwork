Channels were formed by encapsulating a sacrificial photoresist layer between two layers of parylene. Sacrificial layer dissolution in acetone was monitored using time lapse digital photography through a microscope and the captured data plotted and analyzed. The data support a diffusion limited model for photoresist dissolution in acetone.

A challenge in the fabrication of ceramic MEMS is prohibiting cracking that can occur during processing. For example, this is significant in the development of a microcasting fabrication technique from a polymer precursor for silicon carbonitride (SiCN) MEMS. In this case, shrinkage mismatch between the SiCN structure and the microfabricated mold during thermal processes leads to significant stresses that can crack the ceramic structure. Here we propose an approach to overcome this problem that relies on demolding prior to the large shrinkage mismatch thermal processes, which itself is a nontrivial challenge. To this end, we propose a microforging process that facilitates demolding.

We have used micro-electro-discharge machining (micro-EDM) to fabricate magnetoelastic micro-sensor arrays. In response to a time varying magnetic field, amorphous ferromagnetic magnetoelastic thin films efficiently convert magnetic energy into elastic energy. The elastic waves mechanically deform the sensor which, for ribbon shaped elements, has a characteristic mechanical resonant frequency that is a function of its length, elasticity, and material density. Since the magnetoelastic material is also magnetostrictive, as the sensor mechanically deforms it generates magnetic flux that extends remotely about the device, which can be detected by a pickup coil. The remote query capability of this sensor technology enables a host of new monitoring applications including in-situ and in-vivo experiments. The bare sensor is capable of measuring ambient temperature and pressure, liquid density, liquid viscosity, and fluid flow velocity. The sensor platform can be used for chemical sensing when used in combination with mass-changing chemically responsive layers. Using an array of the magnetoelastic sensors one can determine multiple environmental conditions simultaneously.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906532","","Amorphous magnetic materials;Chemical sensors;Magnetic flux;Magnetic materials;Magnetic resonance;Magnetic sensors;Magnetoelasticity;Magnetostriction;Microsensors;Monitoring","electrical discharge machining;magnetic sensors;magnetoelastic effects;magnetostrictive devices;micromachining;microsensors;monitoring","amorphous ferromagnetic thin film;environmental monitoring;magnetoelastic microsensor array;magnetostriction;mechanical resonant frequency;micro-electro-discharge machining;passive wireless microsensor","","5","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Length scale matching between the flow and the device is the key for efficient momentum and energy transfers of the desired fluid motions. MEMS enable us to handle minute amounts of fluid in the nano or pico liter range. With properly designed microfluidic devices, molecules can be directly manipulated by the flow patterns inside the device, which provides a pathway to exploit the nano world. Obviously, understanding of the molecular effects on flows becomes a crucial issue. In traditional fluid dynamics, the flow length scale is much larger than the molecular length scale. Continuum is the most common hypothesis for flow researches. In the case of micro/nano engineering system, we are in the transition regime between continuum and molecule dominated conditions. This feature brings us the challenges when exploring the science and developing the technology in micro/nano fluidics.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906556","","Aerospace control;Aerospace engineering;DNA;Energy exchange;Fluid flow control;Fluidics;Proteins;RNA;Transducers;Weight control","microfluidics;nanotechnology;viscosity","MEMS;embedded particles;energy transfers;flow patterns;length scale matching;microfluidics;molecular effects;molecule dominated conditions;nano engineering system","","8","4","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Infrared absorption spectroscopy can distinguish gases easily and also detect nonreactive molecules like CO/sub 2/, in contrast to e.g. metal oxide gas sensors. The following new spectrometer concept avoids expensive linear detectors as used for grating spectrometers: A tunable interference filter scans the desired part of the infrared spectrum. A single pixel thermopile detector measures serially the intensify at selected wavelengths. The tunable optical interference filter is fabricated by a new porous silicon batch technology using only two photolithography steps. The refractive index of this filter microplate is gradually modulated in depth to create a Bragg mirror, edge filter or a Fabry-Perot bandpass filter for central wavelengths between 400 nm and 8 /spl mu/m. Two thermal bimorph micro-actuators tilt the plate by up to 90/spl deg/, changing the incidence angle of the beam to be analyzed. This tunes the wavelength transmitted to the detector. The filter area can be chosen between 0.27 mm/spl times/0.70 mm and 2.50 mm/spl times/3.00 mm, its thickness is typically 30 /spl mu/m. The spectral finesse /spl lambda///spl Delta//spl lambda/ of 25 is sufficient for most diagnosis applications. First results showed that CO/sub 2/ and CO can be detected selectively with this system-which is interesting in combustion processes-by measuring their absorption at 4.26 /spl mu/m and 4.65 /spl mu/m respectively.

The 14th IEEE International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","216","219","Flexible microelectrode arrays (FMAs) allow interfacing to delicate living tissues such as neural tissue with a minimum of physical disruption of that tissue during and after insertion. This physical disruption is minimized since the compliant FMAs can deform along with the tissue. However, a problem with these arrays is the insertion and subsequent precise positioning of the arrays in the tissue. Previous FMAs required hand assembly of the flexible array with another rigid structure. This may not be feasible if the dimensions of the flexible array are too small. In this work, FMAs with integrated rigid insertion devices were designed, fabricated, and assessed. Thin-film technology and electrodeposition were used to create flexible arrays with attached rigid insertion devices in a single sequence of fabrication steps. These arrays can be designed in two different configurations. The first type allows for flexible electrodes to be sewn through a nerve. The second allows for insertion into a surface such as the cerebral cortex or the spinal cord. After insertion, the rigid portion of the FMA is removed from the tissue with the flexible portion remaining behind. These two implantation schemes were tested on tissue models and found to be straightforward and reliable. In addition, comparisons of the potential to cause tissue damage between flexible and rigid arrays of similar dimensions were made under three different conditions of mechanical perturbation. In all cases, FMAs caused no damage to the tissue model above that caused by the original electrode insertion track while rigid arrays caused significant tearing. Finally, FMAs were shown to successfully stimulate neural tissue in an experimental setting.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906517","","Assembly;Biomedical electrodes;Brain modeling;Cerebral cortex;Computer interfaces;Fabrication;Microelectrodes;Physics computing;Spinal cord;Testing","biological tissues;biomedical electrodes;electrodeposition;microelectrodes;neurophysiology","cerebral cortex;electrodeposition;flexible microelectrode array;implantation;integrated rigid insertion device;neural tissue;spinal cord;thin film technology","","2","2","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work develops and experimentally verifies microchannel simulations, which relate the temperature field to the applied power and flowrate. The simulations consider silicon conduction and assume an immediate transition to homogeneous misty flow, without the bubbly and plug-flow regimes in larger channels. Pressure drop and wall temperature predictions are consistent with data for a channel with cross-sectional dimensions of 50 /spl mu/m/spl times/70 /spl mu/m. The simulations explore the performance of a novel heat sink system with an electrokinetic pump for the liquid phase, which provides 1 atm and 15 ml/min.

Its cost and performance advantages allow to address volume markets like monolithic integrated sensors for automotive application. Using modern silicon processes and their potential for large scale integration, new functions like on-chip calibration and diagnosis are possible. Furthermore, it offers direct digital output signals which is ideal for data processing in microcontrollers. In this technology, the non electric functional blocks (e.g. membranes for pressure sensors) can be miniaturized in a way so that they do not impose a chip real-estate penalty. This immediately reduces the production cost immensely.

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable.

The fabrication process of the nanometric Si wire has been previously reported at MEMS 2000, wherein the elastic properties at room temperature were also investigated by using specimen sizes ranging from nano- to millimeter-scale. This paper investigates elastic-plastic deformation behavior of the nanometric Si wires. Young's modulus of the nanometric Si shows temperature dependence but has no size effect. However, the bending strength, critical resolved shear stress and plastic strain range depend on specimen size and temperature. This research shows for the first time, that it is possible to induce plastic deformation in the nanometric wire at even 373 K, which is close to room temperature. AFM observations show that the slip line density depending on the specimen size and deformation temperature can determine the plastic strain range and the yield point of the nanometric Si wire at the intermediate temperatures.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906497","","Capacitive sensors;Mechanical factors;Microelectromechanical devices;Nanoscale devices;Plastics;Silicon;Temperature dependence;Temperature distribution;Testing;Wire","Young's modulus;atomic force microscopy;bending strength;elemental semiconductors;micromechanical devices;plastic deformation;silicon;slip;yield point","295 to 573 K;AFM bending testing;MEMS material;Si;Young modulus;bending strength;critical resolved shear stress;elastic-plastic deformation;intermediate temperature;mechanical properties;nanometric self-supported single crystal silicon wire;plastic strain;plasticity;slip line density;specimen size;temperature dependence;yield point","","3","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This reduction of gas volume actively pulls liquid back into the system. The electrochemical actuator electrodes have been specially designed to perform the simultaneous measurement of conductivity, via which the total amount of gas can be estimated.

The valve can be actuated as an on/off switch, or using pulse width modulation (PWM) to achieve a controlled flow rate. To our knowledge, previously reported, electrostatically actuated microvalves have had much larger orifices, which limited the operating pressures to less than 200 mbar, an order of magnitude lower than the valve presented. Furthermore, a controlled flow rate using PWM has never been demonstrated experimentally.

Also previously shown was the ability of flexural plate wave (FPW) devices to move particles in a pumped liquid. Recognizing the FPW pumping as a self-cleaning mechanism for microfilters presents exciting possibilities for reduced filter fouling, allowing larger volumes of fluid to be filtered and extending filter lifetime. Both the filtered fluid and the collected large particles could be the useful output. Acoustic particle manipulation has now been shown to free 2 and 10 /spl mu/m diameter spheres and sweep them away from once-blocked pores in both 4 /spl mu/m and 8 /spl mu/m filters.

Two kind of geometries have been studied.

The second type of geometry is composed of a series of short helix elements arranged in pairs; each pair comprised of a right-handed and left-handed element arranged alternately in a pipe.

In this paper an analytical model is presented to describe the physical processes that govern the behaviour of the sensor and determine its sensitivity. The Microflown consists of two heaters that act simultaneously as sensors. Forced convection by an acoustic wave leads to a small perturbation of this temperature profile, resulting in a temperature difference between the two sensors. This temperature difference, to which the sensitivity is proportional, is calculated with perturbation theory. Consequently the frequency dependent behaviour of the sensitivity is analysed; it is found that there are two important corner frequencies, the first related to the time constant velocity of heat diffusion between the sensors, the second related to the heat capacity of the heaters. The developed model is verified by experiments. Previously a very good model has been given for the performance of the Microflown in a channel, i.e. with both heaters between fixed walls walls in the positive and negative z-direction. Here, a model is presented that describes the situation of the present used sensors: without walls under and above them.

The suspended n-well structure is obtained by simple front-end bulk etching of the fabricated CMOS dies, while the n-well region is protected from etching by electrochemical etch-stop technique within a TMAH solution. Electrical connections to the suspended n-well are obtained with polysilicon interconnect layer instead of aluminum to increase the thermal isolation of the pixel by an order of magnitude. Since polysilicon has very low TCR and high resistance, the effective TCR of the pixel is reduced to 0.34%/K, even though the n-well TCR is measured to be 0.58%/K. A 16/spl times/16 pixel array prototype with 80 /spl mu/m/spl times/80 /spl mu/m pixel sizes has successfully been implemented. The pixel resistance measurements show that pixels are very uniform with a nonuniformity of 1.23%. Measurements and calculations show that the detector and the array provide a responsivity of 1200 V/W, a detectivity of 2.2/spl times/10/sup 8/ cm/Hz/sup 1/2//W, and a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 200 mK at 0.5 Hz frame rate with fully serial readout scheme.

Since the method does not require sacrificial etching processes normally used in major micromachining such as surface micromachining and LIGA process, the fabrication process of movable microstructures can be drastically simplified. In addition, the movable microstructures can be driven by means of laser-scanning micromanipulation, because the resultant microstructures are transparent to visible and near infrared light.

The adhesion between Parylene and gold is studied along with the reduction of adhesion of the sealing ring to the valve seat when self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings are used on gold. Testing results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM coating.

Copper-column-based solder bump design and underfill encapsulation resin characteristics were optimized to reduce the strain in the bump and to achieve fine-pitch flip-chip interconnection with high reliability. High-aspect-ratio sidewall footprints were realized by the copper-filled stacked vias at the edge of the module substrate. High-precision distribution of sidewall footprints was achieved by laminating the multiple stack-unit substrates simultaneously.

This process, which repeats the conventional D-RIE (ASE process) and O/sub 2/ plasma irradiation processes alternately, can improve the aspect ratio due to the prevention of lateral etching. However, the SiO/sub 2/ mask erosion of this process was 2.7 times as high as that of the conventional D-RIE process because the SiO/sub 2/ mask is sputtered by oxygen ion in the O/sub 2/ plasma irradiation process. Therefore the highest aspect ratio:46 was restricted by mask consumption. In this study, we suppressed the SiO/sub 2/ mask consumption. This suppression improves etching selectivity and increases the highest aspect ratio up to 60. Furthermore, the required process time is reduced to 2/3 of the prior result.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906482","","Condition monitoring;Electrodes;Plasma applications;Plasma density;Plasma devices;Plasma measurements;Plasma temperature;Protection;Radio frequency;Sputter etching","elemental semiconductors;masks;micromechanical devices;silicon;silicon compounds;sputter etching","ASE process;D-RIE process;MEMS technology;O/sub 2/ plasma irradiation;Si-SiO/sub 2/;Si/SiO/sub 2/ mask etching selectivity;aspect ratio;mask erosion","","1","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low leakage MOS capacitors formed into DRIE trenches form effective ion collection traps with stable and electrostatically isolated capacitances. These closely spaced arrays of Faraday cups enable a new generation of compact mass spectrometers with true multi-channel detection capability. Since all of the incident ion flux is continuously intercepted by the array, no ion flux is lost as in scanning systems, and the overall sensitivity of the mass spectrometer is drastically improved by a factor approximately equal to the number of cups in the array.

Bends or curves in a duct always induce flow separation at the walls, which results in additional pressure loss. In this work, this phenomenon is investigated on a microscale. A set of microchannels, 20 /spl mu/m/spl times/1.1 /spl mu/m/spl times/5810 /spl mu/m in dimensions, with a 90/spl deg/-bend at the channel center has been fabricated using standard micromachining techniques. Three bend configurations have been tested: miter, curved, and double-turn. All the microchannels were integrated with pressure microsensors. Argon gas was passed through the microdevices under inlet pressure up to 50 psi, and the mass flow rate was measured for all the devices as a function of the pressure drop.

Extending a standard process for the realization of electrical recording and stimulating probes, the drug delivery probe adds microchannels, fluidic cables, dielectric shutters over the injecting orifices, and in-line flowmeters to verify the intended dose. These fluidic components require three masks in addition to the normal probe process. The fluidic cables are 1.5X more flexible than the polyimide tubing formerly used and can be integrated with the probes, while the shutters reduce the unintended delivery of drugs into tissue by a factor of 25 compared with an open orifice. The flowmeter operates in pulsed mode as a hot wire anemometer, with a power dissipation of 1.5 mW and a flow resolution of about 150 pL/sec. The temperature rise in tissue near the flowmeter is less than 1/spl deg/C.

We present a new methodology for design and fabrication of multiple reaction systems using the concept of heat integration. Heat integration is a design concept that strikes a balance between complete thermal isolation of individual thermal operations and power consumption in a multiple reaction device. It relies on the use of steady-state temperature gradients developed in the substrate, by the actuation of a single reaction chamber, to initiate several reactions at progressively lower temperatures. The use of thermal gradients in this manner eliminates power requirements to heat individual reactions, active temperature control of ""passive"" reaction chambers and power requirement for cooling. Complete thermal isolation on the other hand, requires higher power for device cooling but, unlike the case of heat integration, geometry of component placement is relatively unconstrained.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906560","","Cooling;Equations;Genetics;Geometry;Heat transfer;Heating;Steady-state;Temperature control;Temperature sensors;Thermal conductivity","DNA;biochemistry;biological techniques;genetics;heat transfer;micromechanical devices;proteins","active temperature control;component placement;cooling;genetic analysis;heat integration;multiple reaction systems;power consumption;reaction chambers;steady-state temperature gradients;thermal gradients","","0","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this report, a kind of polydiacetylene (PDA) substituted with alkyl-urethane is investigated. This material is known to exhibit reversible PIPT around 125/spl deg/C between the 'blue' phase and 'red' phase. The authors measured the induced macroscopic elongation of PDA crystal using a displacement meter. The induced strains due to thermal phase transition were measured to be 2%, 0.03%, and 0.9% at 125/spl deg/C for the a-, b-, and c-axes, respectively. These values are larger than that of the piezoelectric or thermal-expansion materials conventionally used for microactuators.

A small metal wire for a nano-heater is fabricated at the apex of a pyramidal SiO/sub 2/ tip, which is formed by low temperature oxidation of a silicon etch-pit at 950/spl deg/C, consecutive metal deposition (Pt/Cr or Au/Cr) to fill the metal into the etch-pit, and etching of the SiO/sub 2/ in buffered HF solution. Another metal (Ni) is deposited on the small wire to form a metal-to-metal junction that enables to measure the temperature at the tip end. Metal feed-through are formed on a glass substrate that is bonded with the probe array, which enables to transmit a high-speed signal to a processing-circuit and increase the probe array density. Using the thermal probe, temperature distribution on a sample surface is measured. The heating capability of nano-heater is confirmed by the resistivity change and thermophoton emission from the nano-heater when flowing a small current into the nano-heater. By using a micro-probe, preliminary experiment for data writing and erasing is performed on phase change medium.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906514","","Chromium;Etching;Fabrication;Gold;Memory;Oxidation;Probes;Silicon;Temperature measurement;Wire","infrared imaging;microsensors","100 nm;data storage;high-speed signal;metal-to-metal junction;microprobe array;nanometric thermal imaging;probe array density;sub-100 nm nano-heater;temperature distribution;thermal probe","","3","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With continuously increasing recording density this distance reduces and will fall below ten nanometers in the near future. This paper discusses the use of thin-film microheaters integrated into the air-bearing surface of such sliders for in-situ flying-height control. The microheaters can be realized with only a few fabrication steps that can be added to the standard slider manufacturing process. The microheaters transfer thermal energy into the sliders leading to nonuniform deformation, of the air-bearing surfaces. As a consequence the balance between the air cushion lift forces and the load forces is shifted and the flying height is varied. A transfer of thermal energy into the air cushion is also discussed. A comparison of experiments and simulations reveals that microheater-induced changes in the waviness of the air-bearing surface are responsible for flying-height actuation with both polarities. Based on this finding actuation schemes with improved efficiency are discussed that offer the possibility of compensating manufacturing tolerances and also of improving the reliability of future hard-disk drives.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906512","","Actuators;Disk recording;Etching;Hard disks;Laboratories;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic levitation;Manufacturing processes;Spinning;Temperature","disc drives;hard discs;magnetic heads;micromechanical devices","air cushion lift forces;air-bearing sliders;flying-height actuation;flying-height control;hard-disk drives;integrated microheaters;load forces;nonuniform deformation;sliders;thermal energy","","9","8","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For proof of the concept, a pneumatically-actuated three-way microvalve system composed of three independent one-way valve units was fabricated and tested. Each valve unit has a membrane, which is actuated by external negative air pressure. Intervals between the valve units are smaller than 780 /spl mu/m. These small intervals have been realized by providing the system with a layer of microchannels to conduct the air pressure to the valve units. All the parts were made of inexpensive silicone elastomer - polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) - and rapidly fabricated with molding and spin-coating.

Flow visualization was carried out to understand the boiling mechanism in such a system. Three phase-change modes were observed depending on the input power level. Local nucleation boiling within the microchannels occurred at low power level. At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system.

The actuator diaphragm is made of two layers of parylene membranes with offset vent holes. Without electrostatic actuation, air can move freely from one side of the skin to the other side through the vent holes. With actuation, these vent holes are sealed and the airflow is controlled. The membrane behaves as a complete diaphragm. We have successfully demonstrated this function using a 2-mm/spl times/2-mm parylene diaphragm electrostatic actuator valves. This work also includes the novel anti-stiction technology that is crucial to make such large-area parylene actuator diaphragm with the combined use of anti-stiction posts, self-assembled monolayers (SAM), surface roughening, and bromine trifluoride (BrF/sub 3/) dry etching. With the help of SAM treatment, the operating voltage is lowered from 30 volts to 13 volts. The load deflection method is then used to measure the effective thickness of the composite diaphragm. The flexible parylene diaphragm can be deflected up to 100 /spl mu/m when 150 Torr of pressure is applied. The result is fitted into a theoretical model and yields an effective thickness of 5.9 /spl mu/m, which is agreeable with the actual thickness of 5.6 /spl mu/m, thus proves the functionality of the device.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906591","","Adaptive control;Biomembranes;Electrostatic actuators;Programmable control;Rough surfaces;Skin;Surface roughness;Surface treatment;Valves;Vents","adaptive control;diaphragms;electrostatic actuators;flexible structures;flow control;membranes;microvalves;polymer films","13 V;150 torr;MEMS wing;anti-stiction post;composite diaphragm;dry etching;effective thickness;flexible parylene electrostatic actuator;load deflection;membrane;micro adaptive flow control;micro-air-vehicle;self-assembled monolayer;surface roughening;valve;vent hole","","2","11","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SiCN is a new class of polymer-derived ceramics whose starting material is a liquid-phase polymer. By adding a photo-initiator to the precursor, photolithographical patterning of the precursor can lie accomplished by UV exposure. The resulting solid polymer structures are then crosslinked under isostatic pressure, and pyrolyzed. Thermal decomposition transforms the polymer to an amorphous ceramic capable of withstanding over 1500/spl deg/C. By adding and curing successive layers of liquid polymer precursor on top of one another, multi-layered ceramic structures can be easily fabricated. The use of photo-polymerization can also be used to make thin, membrane-like ceramic structures. By combining photo-polymerization with other in-house developed techniques such as polymer-based bonding and flip-chip bonding, three SiCN MEMS devices for high temperature applications have been fabricated: an electrostatic actuator, a pressure transducer, and a combustion chamber.

Analyte gases are absorbed by a sensitive layer deposited on the cantilever. The corresponding mass increase leads to a decrease of the beam's resonance frequency. In this way, concentrations of various VOC's in synthetic air are measured. The influence of polymer thickness on resonance frequency, quality factor, and vibration amplitude is investigated. The frequency stability and sensitivity of the cantilever sensor is tested and an optimal polymer thickness of 3-4 pm determined. A limit of detection of 0.8 ppm for octane is calculated.

Structural and fluidic simulations were used to design the geometry of the device before manufacturing. After devices have been characterized experimental results demonstrate the credibility of the design, the accuracy of the flow rate and the long-term stability of the device. One application of this device is the replacement of the flow restrictor in an elastomeric infusion system, which will increase the accuracy and safety of the drug delivery system.

To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves. For that purpose, the idea of hydraulic mean depth is introduced and is applied to the Reynolds equation.

The fluidic self-assembly technique we have developed exploits hydrophobic-hydrophilic surface patterning and capillary forces of an adhesive liquid between binding sites to drive the assembly process. To achieve high alignment yield, the desired assembly configuration must be a (global) energy minimum, while other (local) energy minima corresponding to undesired configurations should be avoided. Thus, the design of an effective fluidic self-assembly system using this technique requires an understanding of the interfacial phenomena involved in capillary forces; improvement of its performance involves the global optimization of design parameters such as binding site shapes and surface chemistry. This paper presents a model and computational tools for the efficient analysis and simulation of fluidic self-assembly. The strong, close range attractive forces that govern our fluidic self-assembly technique are approximated by a purely geometric model, which allows the application of efficient algorithms to predict system behavior. Various binding site designs are analyzed, and the results are compared with experimental observations. For a given binding site design, the model predicts the outcome of the self assembly process by determining minimum energy configurations and detecting unwanted local minima, thus estimating expected yield. These results can be employed toward the design of more efficient self-assembly systems.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906555","","Analytical models;Assembly;Chemistry;Computational modeling;Design optimization;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Self-assembly;Shape;Solid modeling","capillarity;microassembling;microfluidics;micromechanical devices;semiconductor process modelling","MEMS;adhesive liquid;alignment yield;binding sites;capillary forces;design parameters;expected yield;fluidic self-assembly;geometric model;global optimization;hydrophobic-hydrophilic surface patterning;interfacial phenomena;massively parallel self-assembly;minimum energy configurations;surface chemistry","","16","11","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection specificity is achieved using a MB based DNA hybridization technique.

We can hence eliminate washing and immobilization steps and establish the inchannel detection technique. This technique reduces the detection volume to 36 pL.

We demonstrate that this approach for generating the frequency-dependent gas-damping model is more than 100 times faster than previous approaches, which solve the linearized Reynolds equation using a transient FEM solver. The low-order gas-damping model can be easily inserted into a system-level modeling package for transient and frequency analysis. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental results for four different devices.","1084-6999","0-7803-5998-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2001.906554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906554","","Approximation algorithms;Damping;Equations;Frequency;Linear approximation;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromechanical devices;Packaging;Springs;Transient analysis","finite element analysis;micromechanical devices;semiconductor device models;transient analysis","Arnoldi-based model-order-reduction algorithm;FEM approximation;arbitrarily shaped MEMS devices;frequency analysis;frequency dependent macro-models;gas damping;low-order models;macromodel extraction technique;spring phenomena;system-level modeling package;transient analysis","","1","","","","","25-25 Jan. 2001","21 Jan 2001-25 Jan 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, there is an ongoing research activity to utilize Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) processes to develop a smaller and lighter Sun sensor for space applications. A prototype Sun sensor has been designed and constructed. It consists of a piece of silicon coated with a thin layer of chrome, and a layer of gold with hundreds of small pinholes, placed on top of an image detector at a distance of less than a millimeter. Images of the Sun are formed on the detector when the Sun illuminates the assembly. Software algorithms must be able to identify the individual pinholes on the image detector and calculate the angle to the Sun. Fuzzy image processing is utilized in this process. This paper describes how the fuzzy image processing is implemented in the instrument. Also, a camera pin hole model is constructed and used to evaluate the accuracy of the Sun sensor","","0-7803-7293-X","","10.1109/FUZZ.2001.1008905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008905","","Coordinate measuring machines;Detectors;Image processing;Image sensors;Mechanical sensors;Position measurement;Propulsion;Space technology;Space vehicles;Sun","attitude control;fuzzy logic;image processing;image sensors;microsensors;space vehicles","Jet Propulsion Laboratory;Sun sensor;attitude control;fuzzy image processing;fuzzy logic;image detector;micro electromechanical systems;spacecraft","","2","1","","","","2001","02 Dec 2001-05 Dec 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are sensors of heat, concentration of ions in certain solution (ISFET sensors), acceleration, infrared radiation etc. This is connected with the very fast development of microelectronic technologies, which are supported with design kits. The designers that use a particular design kit has to obey the design rules - the set of rules appropriate for a specified technology. The most widely used standard in microelectronics design is CADENCE, which is a fully integrated design environment. This software offers the possibility of designing and modelling the most advanced units. In this paper the efficient path of designing silicon microsystems using the CADENCE CAD environment is presented. Moreover, it contains the behavioural models of microelectronic sensors, which are the basic part of microsystems.
