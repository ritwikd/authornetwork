Characterizing such composite cores with respect to their power/performance tradeoffs is critical for design reuse across various products and relies heavily on synthesis tools. We present CAPS, an online adaptive algorithm that efficiently explores the design space of any given core and returns an accurate characterization of its implementation tradeoffs in terms of an approximate Pareto set. It does so by supervising the order of the time-consuming logic-synthesis runs on the core's components. Our algorithm can provably achieve the desired precision on the approximation in the shortest possible time, without having any a-priori information on any component.

"Design, CAD and technology challenges for future processors: 3D perspectives","Burns, J.; Carpenter, G.; Kursun, E.; Puri, R.; Warnock, J.; Scheuermann, M.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","212","212","Technology scaling has provided the semiconductor industry a recipe to successfully meet the application demands for performance for over three decades. This computational capacity was further fueled by the success of circuit and architecture-level innovation, which provided performance improvement in each processor generation. However, future processor designs face a number of key challenges in sustaining the growth trends. The dawn of the 22nm node, and beyond, marks an era of new trends and challenges; where the cost and complexity associated with each technology node is increasing at much faster rate than the device performance gains. Novel tools and design methodologies are needed to not only compensate for these challenges but also to leverage emerging technologies to achieve the desired performance in future processor architectures. Technology alternatives such as 3D integration have attracted significant interest as an additional way of sustaining the density scaling and performance growth. 3D integration provides some unique benefits for processor design, such as packaging density, interconnect bandwidth and latency, modularity, and heterogeneity. Packaging density improvement provided by 3D can be used to continue improvements in processing and storage capacity as well as enabling a gradual shift towards integrating the full system in one stack. Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) provide lower latency and higher bandwidth that improves interconnect-limited performance. 3D enables modular design of a variety of systems from a shared set of sub-components through functional separation of the device layers. As a result, different layers can be independently manufactured in the most cost effective ways, which can be stacked to compose a wide range of customized systems. Optimizing layer interfaces and infrastructure components, such as power delivery and clocking, can further enhance the inherent modularity advantages. 3D provides opportunities for composing future s- - ystems by integrating disparate technologies as well as different technology generations in the same stack. It can be used to incorporate a wide range of device layers including non-volatile memory layers, MEMS, FPGAs, DRAM or photonics in the same stack, easing the IO/off-chip bandwidth limitations. This provides the opportunity to enable processor architectures with new computation, storage and communication capabilities. The system-level benefits of 3D will be determined, to a significant degree, by the effectiveness of novel design methodologies that explore the new design space introduced by the vertical dimension. Design flow optimization is essential in achieving the highest performance gains as well as tackling the more prominent interdependencies among performance, power dissipation, temperatures, interconnectivity and reliability in 3D. This presentation will highlight these challenges and opportunities.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981937","3D Integration;3DI;Microprocessors","Bandwidth;Design methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance evaluation;Performance gain;Program processors;Three dimensional displays","electronics packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips;technology CAD (electronics);three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D integration;CAD;IO/off-chip bandwidth limitations;TSV;clocking;density scaling;interconnect bandwidth;interconnect-limited performance;nonvolatile memory layers;packaging density;performance growth;power delivery;processor design;technology scaling;through-silicon-vias","","1","","","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, power gating introduces unique power delivery integrity issues and tradeoffs between switching and rush current (wake-up) supply noises. In addition, in power-gated power delivery networks (PDNs), the amount of power saving intrinsically trades off with power integrity. In this paper, we propose systemic decoupling capacitance optimization strategies that optimally balance between switching and rush current noises, and tradeoff between power integrity and wake-up time, hence power saving. Furthermore, we propose a novel re-routable decoupling capacitance concept to break the tight interaction between power integrity and power saving, providing further improved tradeoffs between the two.

Specifically, we decide the count, location and pumping pressure drop/flow rate of micro-channels such that acceptable cooling is achieved at minimum pumping power.

The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 3D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3D cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) 3D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs, (2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, 3D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2D routers since the physical positions of TSVs are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981862","3D ICs;Physical Design;Placement","Equations;Estimation error;Mathematical model;Routing;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias","integrated circuit design;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC design;3D IC placement;3D analytical global placement;3D routing;TSV aware analytical placement;TSV aware legalization;density optimization;layer-by-layer detailed placement;log sum exp wirelength model;three dimensional integrated circuit;through silicon vias;weighted average wirelength model","","2","","19","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By linking these two methods of different levels of abstraction, one can thereby easily profile the power consumption of a multi-core SoC running a complete application while retaining high accuracy of estimation. We have realized the proposed methodology into two software tools: (1) PowerMixer<sup>IP</sup>, an IP-based power model builder that uses different strategies to build versatile power models for general IPs and processor IPs, and (2) PowerDepot, an ESL power estimation tool that can interact with the users in a simple way and then generate the needed power monitors to be embedded into the ESL design in SystemC for super-fast power estimation so as to facilitate early-stage system-wide power profiling. The application of these tools on a dual-core real-life designs executing an H.264 shows that the average error of the ESL power estimation is less than 2%, while the speedup can be up to 2400X when comparing to gate-level simulation.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981920","IP-based power modeling;System-level power analysis","Estimation;IP networks;Load modeling;Logic gates;Monitoring;Program processors;System-on-a-chip","C language;integrated circuit design;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;system-on-chip","ESL power analysis;IP-based power model builder;IP-based power modeling;SystemC;dual-core real-life designs;electronic system level;gate-level simulation;multicore SoC designs;power estimation tool;power profiling;powerdepot;powermixer","","1","","22","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A procedure is presented that uses that information to determine an ad-hoc scrubbing sequence that maximizes reliability. The approach is then applied to a case study and results show a significant increase in the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) compared with traditional scrubbing.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981865","Multiple Cell Upsets (MCUs);memories;radiation;reliability;scrubbing","Integrated circuit reliability;Life estimation;Neutrons;Performance evaluation;Reliability engineering;Testing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerant computing;reliability;storage management","MCU;ad hoc scrubbing sequences design;mean time to failure;memory reliability;multiple cell upset;soft error","","0","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Projection of SET sensitivity with scaling is essential to assess the logic failure and error probability in modern technology generations. This paper discusses the effects of device scaling from 45nm to 12nm processes and circuit parameter tuning on SETs. The failure due to particle strikes i.e., Single Event upsets (SEU) as well as its behavior with process variations and reliability mechanisms such as NBTI is evaluated in this work. The critical supply voltage required to avoid SET propagation with circuit parameters is investigated. This work also proposes a probability model which examines the propagation of SET at any node to the output of a circuit.

"Parallel cross-layer optimization of high-level synthesis and physical design","Williamson, J.; Yinghai Lu; Li Shang; Hai Zhou; Xuan Zeng","ECEE, Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA","Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC), 2011 16th Asia and South Pacific","20110303","2011","","","467","472","Integrated circuit (IC) design automation has traditionally followed a hierarchical approach. Modern IC design flow is divided into sequentially-addressed design and optimization layers; each successively finer in design detail and data granularity while increasing in computational complexity. Eventual agreement across the design layers signals design closure. Obtaining design closure is a continual problem, as lack of awareness and interaction between layers often results in multiple design flow iterations. In this work, we propose parallel cross-layer optimization, in which the boundaries between design layers are broken, allowing for a more informed and efficient exploration of the design space. We leverage the heterogeneous parallel computational power in current and upcoming multi-core/many-core computation platforms to suite the heterogeneous characteristics of multiple design layers. Specifically, we unify the highlevel and physical synthesis design layers for parallel cross-layer IC design optimization. In addition, we introduce a massively-parallel GPU floorplanner with local and global convergence test as the proposed physical synthesis design layer. Our results show average performance gains of 11X speed-up over state-of-the-art.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722235","","Benchmark testing;Convergence;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Optimization;Parallel processing","circuit complexity;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;electronic design automation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit layout;iterative methods;multiprocessing systems;sequential circuits","IC design automation;computational complexity;heterogeneous parallel computational power;high-level synthesis;integrated circuit design;many-core computation;massively-parallel GPU floorplanner;multicore computation;multiple design flow iteration;parallel cross-layer optimization;sequentially-addressed design","","0","","19","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Row-based area-array I/O design planning in concurrent chip-package design flow","Ren-Jie Lee; Hung-Ming Chen","Dept. of Electron. Eng., Nat.

Package and board/system designs are usually followed by almost-ready chip designs, which causes long turn-around time communicating with package and system houses. In this paper, the realizations of area-array I/O design methodologies are studied. Different from IC-centric flow, we propose a chip-package concurrent design flow to speed up the design time. Along with the flow, we design the I/O-bump (and P/G-bump) tile which combines I/O (and P/G) and bump into a hard macro with the considerations of I/O power connection and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. We then employ an I/O-row based scheme to place I/O-bump tiles with existed metal layers. By such a scheme, it reduces efforts in I/O placement legalization and the redistribution layer (RDL) routing. With the emphasis on package design awareness, the proposed methods map package balls onto chip I/Os, thus providing an opportunity to design chip and package in parallel. Due to this early study of I/O and bump planning, faster convergence can be expected with concurrent design flow. The results are encouraging and the merits of this flow are reassuring.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722307","","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Electrostatic discharge;Planning;Routing;Sorting;Tiles","electrostatic discharge;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging","I/O-bump tile design;IC-centric design flow;board-system design;chip-package concurrent design flow;electrostatic discharge protection;map package ball method;power connection;redistribution layer routing;row-based area-array I/O design planning","","0","","14","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a novel abstraction and refinement technique for design debugging is presented that addresses two key components of the debugging complexity, the design size and the error trace length. The abstraction technique works by under-approximating the debugging problem by removing modules of the original design and replacing them with simulated values of the erroneous circuit. After each abstract problem is solved, the refinement strategy uses the resulting UNSAT core to direct which modules should be refined. This refinement strategy is extended by allowing refinement of across time-frames in addition to modules. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to return solutions for all instances compared to only 41% without the technique demonstrating the viability of this approach in tackling real-world debugging problems.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722237","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Concrete;Debugging;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model","VLSI;integrated circuit design","UNSAT;VLSI design;abstraction technique;design debugging;very large scale integration","","2","","17","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A general methodology for fidelity-efficiency design space exploration is presented and is applied to a case study implementing the CORDIC algorithm in 130nm technology. The case study reveals that simple precision scaling often provides better power-delay efficiency for a given fidelity than more complex imprecise adders, but different choice of algorithm and fidelity can influence the outcome.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722256","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Delay;Error analysis;Mathematical model","adders;digital arithmetic;fault tolerance;integrated circuit design","CORDIC algorithm;absolute correctness;circuit components;energy benefits;error characteristics;error-tolerant application;fidelity-efficiency design space exploration;imprecise adder design;imprecise adders;imprecise arithmetic;imprecise circuit design;power-delay efficiency;precision scaling;relaxed fidelity requirement","","6","","16","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So post-silicon debugging is becoming a essential part of the design flows for complicated and large system designs. This paper summarizes our research activities targeting post-silicon debugging for highly complicated pipeline processors as well as large ASICs. We have been working on the following three topics: 1) Translation of chip level error traces to high and abstracted level so that more efficient simulation as well as formal analysis become possible, 2) Utilize experiences on formal verification and debugging processes for pipelined processors for debugging and in-fields rectification of chips, and 3) Apply incremental high level synthesis for efficient in-fields rectifications of ASIC designs. Our approaches utilize high level or abstracted design information as much as possible to make things more efficient and effective.

In this paper, from a system and circuit design perspective, we propose a new self-repair design methodology to compensate the GB-induced variations for LTPS liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and active-matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. The key idea is to extend the charging time for detected low drivability pixel switches, hence, suppressing the brightness non-uniformity and eliminating the need for large voltage margins. The proposed circuit was implemented in VGA LCD panels which were used for prediction of power consumption and yield. Based on the simulation results, the proposed circuit decreases the required supply voltage by 20% without performance and yield degradation. 7% yield enhancement is observed for high resolution, large sized LCDs while incurring negligible power penalty. This technique enables LTPS-based displays either to further scale down the device size for higher integration and lower power consumption or to have superior yield in large sized panels with small power overhead.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722276","","Clocks;Detectors;Generators;Pixel;Thin film transistors;Threshold voltage","liquid crystal displays;network synthesis;organic light emitting diodes;power consumption;silicon;thin film transistors;vibrations","LCD;LTPS;circuit design;electrical parameter;liquid crystal displays;low temperature polycrystalline silicon;organic light emitting diode displays;power consumption;random grain boundaries;self-repair design methodology;thin film transistors;variation tolerant","","4","","19","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On the design and analysis of fault tolerant NoC architecture using spare routers","Yung-Chang Chang; Ching-Te Chiu; Shih-Yin Lin; Chung-Kai Liu","Inf. & Commun. Res. Lab., Ind. Technol. Res. Inst., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC), 2011 16th Asia and South Pacific","20110303","2011","","","431","436","The aggressive advent in VLSI manufacturing technology has made dramatic impacts on the dependability of devices and interconnects. In the modern manycore system, mesh based Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is widely adopted as on chip communication infrastructure. It is critical to provide an effective fault tolerance scheme on mesh based NoC. A faulty router or broken link isolates a well functional processing element (PE). Also, a set of faulty routers form faulty regions which may break down the whole design. To address these issues, we propose an innovative router-level fault tolerance scheme with spare routers which is different from the traditional microarchitecture-level approach. The spare routers not only provide redundancies but also diversify connection paths between adjacent routers. To exploit these valuable resources on fault tolerant capabilities, two configuration algorithms are demonstrated. One is shift-and-replace-allocation (SARA) and the other is defect-awareness-path-allocation (DAPA) that takes advantage of path diversity in our architecture. The proposed design is transparent to any routing algorithm since the output topology is consistent to the original mesh.

Since the device layers are processed in sequential order, the size of the vertical contacts is similar to traditional contacts unlike in the case of parallel 3-D integration with through silicon vias (TSVs). Given the advantage of such small contacts, 3DMI enables manufacturing multiple active layers very close to each other. In this work we propose two different strategies of stacking standard cells in 3-D without breaking the regularity of the conventional design flow: a) Vertical stacking of diffusion areas (Intra-Cell stacking) that supports complete reuse of 2-D physical design tools and b) vertical stacking of cells over others (Cell-on-Cell stacking). A placement tool (CELONCEL-placer) targeting the Cell-on-Cell placement problem is proposed to allow high quality 3-D layout generation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CELONCEL technique, fetching us an area gain of 37.5%, 15.51% reduction in wirelength, and 13.49% improvement in overall delay, compared with a 2-D case when benchmarked across an interconnect dominated low-density-parity-check (LDPC) decoder at 45nm technology node.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722210","3-D monolithic Integration;Optimization;Partitioning;Placement;Standard cell","Layout;Libraries;Metals;Monolithic integrated circuits;Pins;Stacking;Transistors","integrated circuit design;monolithic integrated circuits;parity check codes","2D physical design tools;3D monolithic integration;CELONCEL;cell-on-cell stacking;diffusion areas vertical stacking;high performance integrated circuits;intra-cell stacking;low-density-parity-check decoder;sequential integration;size 45 nm;through silicon vias","","11","","27","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the task becomes much harder to solve as the clock tree is designed under multiple power mode environment, in which the voltage applied to some design module varies as the power mode changes. Recently, it is shown that adjustable delay buffer (ADB) whose delay can be tuned dynamically can be used to solve the clock skew problem effectively under multiple power modes. However, due to the area/control overhead by ADBs it is very important to minimize the number of ADBs. This work provides a complete solution to the problem of clock skew minimization using ADBs under multiple power modes. We propose a linear-time optimal algorithm that simultaneously solves the problems of computing (1) the minimum number of ADBs to be used, (2) the location at which each ADB is to be placed, and (3) the delay value of each ADB to be assigned to each power mode. Experimental results show that in comparison with the previous work [8] which iteratively performs the ADB allocation, placement, and delay assignment, our integrated algorithm produces consistently better designs for all tested benchmarks under four power modes, reducing the number of ADBs by 9.27% further on average at skew bound of 30ps~50ps even with shorter clock latencies.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722242","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Clocks;Delay;Optimization;Resource management;Synchronization","buffer circuits;clocks;logic design;minimisation;trees (mathematics)","ADB allocation;ADB placement;adjustable delay buffers;clock latency;clock skew constraint;clock skew minimization;clock tree synthesis;delay assignment;design module;linear-time optimal algorithm;multiple power mode environment;multiple power modes;multivoltage mode designs","","4","","13","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been known that voltage scaling is an effective scheme that is able to mitigate the NBTI effect. However, a careful control of voltage scaling is required not to increase the dissipation of dynamic power significantly. On the other hand, body biasing can also be used to mitigate the NBTI effect by lowering down the threshold voltage, but its effectiveness is limited, as will be demonstrated in this work, and it increases the leakage power. This work addresses an important problem of minimizing the power consumption of circuit while controlling the NBTI induced delay increase to meet the circuit timing constraint by simultaneously utilizing the effects of voltage scaling and body biasing on both NBTI and power consumption. Precisely, we solve the problem of finding a set of supply and body biasing voltage values to apply circuit clusters on standard cell based design to minimize the total power consumption while satisfying the constraint of circuit life time, considering the NBTI induced delay factor in circuit timing computation. By a comprehensive analysis on the relations between the values of supply and body biasing voltages and the values of the resulting power consumption and NBTI induced delay, we precisely formulate the problem, and transform it into a problem of convex optimization to solve it efficiently. Through extensive experimentation using ISCAS benchmark designs, it is shown that the proposed approach to the simultaneous exploitation of supply voltage and body biasing is able to produce designs with 14% and 8% reduced energy consumption on average over the designs produced by the design time NBTI-aware guard-banding based voltage scaling and the run time NBTI-aware voltage scaling, respectively.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722260","","Convex functions;Delay;Energy consumption;Logic gates;Threshold voltage;Voltage control","circuit reliability;integrated logic circuits;low-power electronics;nanoelectronics;thermal stability","ISCAS benchmark design;body biasing;circuit clusters;circuit timing computation;delay factor;fine-grained technique;leakage power;negative bias temperature instability;power consumption;standard cell based design;time NBTI- aware guard-banding based voltage scaling","","8","","20","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The steeply increasing price and difficulty of masks make the mask-based optical lithography, such as ArF immersion lithography and extreme ultra-violet lithography (EUVL), unaffordable when going beyond the 32-nm half-pitch (HP) node. Electron beam direct writing (EBDW), so called maskless lithography (ML2), provides an ultimate resolution without jeopardy from masks, but the extremely low productivity of the traditional single beam systems made it very laborious for mass manufacturing after over 3 decades of development. Although electron beam lithography has been long used for mask writing, it is yet very slow and typically takes from hours to days to write a complete 6-inch high-end mask. Direct writing a 300-mm wafer definitely would take much longer. Considering production efficiency in the cleanroom, the throughput of lithography tools should be in the order of 10 wafers per hour (WPH) per square meter as compared to that of an ArF scanner. To achieve such a throughput per e-beam column requires an improvement of more than 3-order. Increasing the beam current in the conventional single beam system would induce the space charge effect and thus is not a solution. Several groups have proposed different multiple electron beam maskless lithography (MEBML2) approaches, by multiplying either Gaussian beams, variable shape beams or by using cell projections, to increase the throughput. The maturing MEMS technology and electronic control technology enable precise control of more than ten thousands or even millions of electron beamlets, writing in parallel. Without the mask constraint, the exposure can be made by continuously scanning across the entire wafer diameter as long as the ultra-high speed data rate can be supported. Hence a much slower scan speed is required and therefore a small tool footprint is achievable.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722222","","Electron beams;Lifting equipment;Lithography;Throughput;Ultraviolet sources;Writing","electron beam lithography;proximity effect (lithography);resists;ultraviolet lithography","ArF immersion lithography;CAD tool;CAR;EBDW;EUVL;Gaussian beam;MAPPER pre-Alpha tool;MEMS technology;chemical amplified resist;contour-based EPC;e-beam proximity correction;electron beam direct writing;electron-beam lithography;electron-optics column;electronic control technology;extreme ultra-violet lithography;mask-based optical lithography;multiple electron beam maskless lithography MEBML2","","3","","7","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lacking a reconfigurable platform, analog designers are denied the benefits of rapid prototyping, hardware emulation, and smooth migration to advanced technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new approach that maps any AMS design problem to a transistor-level reconfigurable vehicle, thus enabling fast validation and a reduction in post-Silicon bugs, and minimizing design risk and costs. The unique features of the approach include: (1) transistor-level programmability that emulates each transistor behavior in an analog design, reproducing the system and achieving very fine granularity of reconfiguration; (2) programmable switches that are treated as a design component during analog transistor mapping, and optimized with the reconfiguration matrix; (3) parasitics reduction that leverages the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology. Based on these principles, a digitally controlled PANDA platform is designed at a 32nm node. Several 90nm analog blocks are successfully emulated with the 32nm platform, including a folded-cascode operational amplifier, a sample-and-hold module (S/H), and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).

In particular, we show how to create a feasible and efficient gridless routing approach that can be fit into existing gridded routing flows, creating a practical overall routing solution. As a key ingredient, our approach explicitly ad dresses design rule conform (shortest) paths among geometric obstacles, also taking violations within the paths them selves into consideration.

Our architecture consists of Main Processors and Auxiliary Processors with a distributed run-time balancing approach, where each Main Processor, independent of other Main Processors, decides for itself the number of required Auxiliary Processors at run-time depending on its varying workload. The proposed run-time balancing approach is based on off-line statistical information along with workload prediction and run-time monitoring of current and previous workloads' execution times. We exploited the adaptability of our architecture through a case study on an H.264 video encoder supporting HD720p at 30 fps, where clock- and power-gating were used to deactivate idle Auxiliary Processors during low workload periods. The results show that an adaptive pipelined MPSoC provides energy savings of up to 34% and 40% for clock- and power-gating based deactivation of Auxiliary Processors respectively with a minimum throughput of 29 fps when compared to a design-time balanced pipelined MPSoC.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981893","Adaptive MPSoCs;Low-Power Design","Clocks;Energy consumption;Motion estimation;Multimedia communication;Program processors;Streaming media;Throughput","multimedia systems;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip;video coding","H.264 video encoder;auxiliary processors;distributed run-time balancing approach;low-power adaptive pipelined MPSoC architecture;main processors;multimedia applications;off-line statistical information;run-time monitoring;workload prediction","","3","","28","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper seeks to present such an algorithm. Given a layout and a sequence of layout geometry operations, the layout is divided into several partitions. The given sequence of layout geometry operations is executed in parallel on the different partitions. The partitions are merged in a systematic manner and the sequence of operations is repeated on a suitable set of polygons in these newly derived partitions until a partition that covers the entire layout area is obtained. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is correct-by-construction - i.e., each partition is guaranteed to generate a subset of the correct results.

Hardware and software systems that are thus designed may be viewed as “scalable effort systems”, since they offer the capability to modulate the effort that they expend towards computation, thereby allowing for tradeoffs between output quality and efficiency. We propose the concept of Dynamic Effort Scaling (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach - statically setting the scaling mechanisms leads to either significant error overshoot or significant opportunities for energy savings left on the table unexploited. In contrast, DES is able to effectively regulate the output quality while maximally exploiting the time-varying resiliency in the workload.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981982","Approximate Computing;Dynamic Effort Scaling;Low Power Design;Mining;Recognition;Scalable Effort;Support Vector Machines","Computer architecture;Hardware;Latches;Resilience;Sensors;Support vector machines;Voltage control","circuit feedback;microprocessor chips;scaling circuits;support vector machines","control knobs;dynamic effort scaling;dynamic management;error overshoot;feedback control problem;gardware systems;inherent error resilience;quality-efficiency tradeoff;scalable effort systems;scalable-effort processor;scaling mechanisms;software systems;support vector machines;time-varying resiliency","","3","","26","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in order to perform thermal-aware mapping optimization, the timing and thermal characteristics of every candidate mapping have to be analyzed. While the task of analyzing timing characteristics of design alternatives has been extensively investigated in recent years, there is still a lack of methods for accurate and fast thermal analysis. In order to obtain desired evaluation times, the system has to be simulated at a high abstraction level.

In spite of this fact, the OLED display panel is still the dominant power consumer in battery-operated devices. As a result, there have been many attempts to reduce the OLED power consumption. Since power consumption of any pixel of the OLED display depends on the color that it displays, previous power saving methods change the pixel color subject to a tolerance level on the color distortion specified by the users. In practice, the OLED power saving techniques cannot be used on common user applications such as photo viewers and movie players. This paper introduces the first OLED power saving technique that does not result in a significant degradation in the color and luminance values of the displayed image. The proposed technique is based on dynamic (driving) voltage scaling (DVS) of the OLED panel. Although the proposed DVS technique may degrade luminance of the panel, the panel luminance can be restored with appropriate image compensation. Consequently, power is saved on the OLED display panel with only minor changes in the color and luminance of the image. This technique is similar to dynamic backlight scaling of LCDs, but is based on the unique characteristics of the OLED drivers. The proposed method saves wasted power in the driver transistor and the internal resistance with an amplitude modulation driver, and in the internal resistance with a pulse width modulation driver, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed OLED DVS with image compensation technique saves up to 52.5% of the OLED power while keeping the same human-perceived image quality for the Lena image.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981702","DVS;Image Processing;Low-Power Design;OLED","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Power demand;Pulse width modulation;Voltage control","LED displays;image resolution;organic light emitting diodes","DVS;LCD panel;OLED display;amplitude modulation driver;battery-operated device;driver transistor;dynamic voltage scaling;image compensation;internal resistance;liquid crystal display panel;movie players;panel luminance;photo viewers;pixel color;power consumption;power saving methods","","4","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, the reason for a constraint violation is analyzed and a deduced encoding removes it permanently from the search space. Thus, the approach is capable of proving both the presence and absence of a correct implementation. The key benefit of the proposed approach stems from its integral support for real-time constraint checking. Its efficiency, however, results from the power of deduction techniques of state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Using a case study from the automotive domain, experiments show that the proposed system synthesis approach is able to find valid implementations where former approaches fail.

SystemC is a popular modeling language which can be used to specify systems at a high abstraction level. The module hierarchy of a SystemC model is dynamically constructed during the execution of the elaboration phase of the model. This means that a system designer can build regular structures using loops and conditional statements. Currently, most SystemC tools can not cope with SystemC models for which the module hierarchy depends on dynamic parameters. In our approach this hierarchical information is retrieved by controlling and monitoring the executing of the elaboration phase of the model using a GDB debugger. Thereafter, the behavioral information is retrieved by using a GCC plug-in. This plug-in produces abstract syntax trees in static single assignment form. This behavioral information is linked with the hierarchical information. Our approach is completely non-intrusive. The SystemC model and the SystemC reference implementation can be used without any modification. We have implemented our approach in a SystemC front-end called SHaBE (SystemC Hierarchy and Behavior Extractor).

One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually-compatible control signals. Prior works utilize this addressing scheme by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging. However, merging control signals also introduces redundant actuations, which potentially cause a high power-consumption problem. Recent studies on PDMFBs have indicated that high power consumption not only decreases the product lifetime but also degrades the system reliability. Unfortunately, this power-aware design concern is still not readily available among current design automations of PDMFBs. To cope with these issues, we propose in this paper the first power-aware broadcast addressing for PDMFBs.

Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that when a power grid network is locally updated during circuit design, its response changes locally and, hence, the incremental “change” of the power grid voltage is almost zero at many internal nodes, resulting in a unique sparse pattern. An efficient Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed sparse approximation problem. In addition, several numerical techniques are proposed to improve the numerical stability of the proposed solver, while simultaneously maintaining its high efficiency. Several industrial circuit examples demonstrate that when applied to incremental power grid analysis, our proposed approach achieves up to 130× runtime speed-up over the traditional Algebraic Multi-Grid (AMG) method, without surrendering any accuracy.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981988","Incremental Analysis;Integrated Circuit;Power Grid","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Fitting;Matching pursuit algorithms;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Power grids","integrated circuit design;iterative methods;power integrated circuits;sparse matrices","algebraic multi-grid method;incremental analysis;numerical stability;on-chip power grid;orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm;sparse approximation","","0","","21","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an inter-die routing algorithm for 3D ICs with a pre-defined netlist. Our algorithm is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and adopts a two-stage technique of micro-bump assignment followed by non-regular RDL routing. First, the micro-bump assignment selects suitable micro-bumps for the pre-defined netlist such that no crossing problem exists inside the bounding boxes of each net. After the micro-bump assignment, the netlist is divided into two sub-netlists, one is for the upper RDL and the other is for the lower RDL. Second, the non-regular RDL routing determines minimum and non-crossing global paths for sub-netlists in the upper and lower RDLs individually.

We prove that the REP is NP-Complete, and show that it can be formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). A provably good approximation algorithm for the REP is developed by applying Linear Programming (LP) relaxation and a special rounding technique to the ILP. This approximation algorithm is also shown to work for a more general version of REP with weights (weighted REP).

However, at-speed scan test suffers the test-induced yield loss. Because the switching activity in test mode is much higher than that in normal mode, the switching-induced large current drawn causes severe IR drop and increases gate delay. X-filling is the most commonly used technique to reduce IR-drop effect during at-speed test.

Thus, large power-gating devices are often implemented to minimize the drop (thus the frequency degradation), requiring considerable die area. Meanwhile, adaptive voltage scaling has been used to improve yield of power-constrained processors exhibiting a large spread of maximum frequency and total power due to process variations. In this paper, first, we analyze the impact of power-gating device size on both maximum frequency and total power of processors in the presence of process variation. Second, we propose a methodology that optimizes both the size of power-gating devices and the degree of adaptive voltage scaling jointly such that we minimize the device size while maximizing performance and power efficiency of power-constrained processors. Finally, we extend our analysis and optimization for multi-core processors adopting frequency-island clocking scheme. Our experimental results using a 32nm technology model demonstrates that the joint optimization considering both die-to-die and within-die variations reduces the size of power-gating devices by more than 50% with 3% frequency improvement for power-constrained multi-core processors. Further, the optimal size of power-gating devices for multi-core processors using the frequency-island clocking scheme increases gradually while the optimal supply voltage decreases as the number of cores per die increases.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722282","","Degradation;Design methodology;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Optimization;Performance evaluation","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","AVS-aware power gate sizing;adaptive voltage scaling;die-to-die variations;frequency-island clocking scheme;multicore processors;performance maximization;power efficiency;power-constrained processors;power-gating devices;process variations;processor frequency;size 32 nm;within-die variations","","1","","15","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the PPN model is not able to capture adaptive/dynamic behavior. Such behavior is usually expressed by using parameters which values are reconfigured at run-time. To model the adaptive/dynamic applications, in this paper we introduce an extension of the PPN model, called Parameterized Polyhedral Process Networks (P<sup>3</sup>N), which still provides design-time analyzability to some extent. We first formally define the P<sup>3</sup>N model and its operational semantics. In addition, we devise a design-time analysis to extract relations between parameters.

The main idea behind the proposed approach lies on the observation that not all operations are equally important in shaping the output quality of various applications and of the overall system. Based on such an observation, we suggest that all levels of the software design stack, including the programming model, compiler, operating system (OS) and run-time system should identify the critical tasks and ensure correct operation of such tasks by assigning them to dynamically adjusted reliable cores/units. Specifically, based on error rates and operating conditions identified by a sense-and-adapt (SeA) unit, the OS selects and sets the right mode of operation of the overall system. The run-time system identifies the critical/less-critical tasks based on special directives and schedules them to the appropriate units that are dynamically adjusted for highly-accurate/approximate operation by tuning their voltage/frequency. Units that execute less significant operations can operate at voltages less than what is required for correct operation and consume less power, if required, since such tasks do not need to be always exact as opposed to the critical ones. Such scheme can lead to energy efficient and reliable operation, while reducing the design cost and overheads of conventional circuit/micro-architecture level techniques.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981948","Approximate Computing;Energy Efficient;Software","Energy efficiency;Hardware;Integrated circuit reliability;Reliability engineering;Software;Software reliability","compiler generators;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers)","circuit/microarchitecture level;compiler;design paradigm;error rates;next-generation multicore heterogeneous platforms;next-generation unreliable platforms;operating system;programming model;run-time system;sense-and-adapt unit;significance driven computation;software design stack;variation-aware operation","","0","","5","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a trade-off between subthreshold leakage power consumption and clock frequency in the circuit; i.e., for higher performance, leakage power consumption must be sacrificed and vice versa. Meanwhile, timing analysis during synthesis and physical design is pessimistic, which means there are some slacks available to be traded for leakage power minimization. This power minimization can be done after the sign-off which is more accurate and realistic than if it is done before the sign-off. The available slack can be traded for leakage power minimization by footprint-based cell swapping and threshold voltage assignment. In this paper, we introduce our post sign-off leakage power optimization problem as a nonlinear mathematical program and solve it by using conjugate gradient (CG) method. We set up a novel transformation technique to manipulate the constraints of the optimization problem to be solved by CG. We show that by doing this optimization we can reduce the leakage power consumption by 34% on average in comparison with no power optimization after sign-off.

Post-silicon power modeling is an essential step for design validation and for building trustable pre-silicon power models and analyses. One popular approach for devising post-silicon power estimates is to translate the thermal emissions from the backside of the die into power estimates. Such approach faces a major physical challenge arising from spatial heat diffusion which blurs the resultant thermal images. The objective of this paper is to improve post-silicon power mapping by utilizing lock-in thermography techniques where AC signals, rather than DC signals, are used to excite the circuit blocks. We prove and demonstrate that using AC excitation sources reduces the extent of spatial heat diffusion. We devise a lock-in based thermal to power inversion methodology that maps spatial power consumption on a real chip. Using a custom test chip, we are to able to scientifically quantify and validate the improvements in power mapping attained from the proposed techniques.

In such a framework, grid verification becomes a question of computing the worst-case voltage drops which, in turn, entails the solution of as many linear programs (LPs) as there are nodes. First, we extend grid verification to also check for the worst-case branch currents. We show that this would require as many LPs as there are branches. Second, we propose a starkly different approach to reduce the number of LPs in the verification problem. We achieve this by examining dominance relations among node voltage drops and among branch currents. This allows us to replace a group of LPs by one conservative and tight LP.

On this account, the schedules must be (i) sustainable, i.e., when messages are added in later iterations, they must preserve deadline guarantees of existing messages and (ii) extensible, i.e., they must accommodate future messages without changes to existing schedules. Unfortunately, traditionally used metrics of sustainability and extensibility for timing and schedulability analysis are generic and can not be trivially adapted to FlexRay schedules. This is because of platform-specific properties of FlexRay like being a hybrid paradigm, where both time-triggered and event-triggered segments are used for communication. In this paper, we first introduce new notions of sustainability and extensibility for FlexRay that capture protocol-specific properties and then present novel metrics to quantify sustainable and extensible schedules.

To deal with this problem, we propose a simulated annealing based approach to construct a common-centroid placement which exhibits the highest possible degree of dispersion. To facilitate this framework, we first propose the pair-sequence representation to represent a common-centroid placement. Then, we present three operations to perturb the representation, which can increase the degree of dispersion without breaking the common-centroid constraint in the resulting placement. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of our simulated annealing based approach, we propose three techniques to speed up our program. The experimental results show that our placements can simultaneously achieve smaller oxide-gradient-induced mismatch and larger overall correlation coefficients (i.e., higher degree of dispersion) than in all test cases.

While considering the thermal effect of TSVs during placement appears to be quite complicated, we are able to prove that when the TSV area in each bin is proportional to the lumped power consumption in that bin, together with the bins in all the tiers directly above it, the peak temperature is minimized. Based on this criterion, we implement a thermal-aware 3D placement tool. Compared to the methods that prefer a uniform power distribution that only results in an 8% peak temperature reduction, our method reduces the peak temperature by 34% on average with even slightly less wirelength overhead.

This paper shows that in statistical path selection, this is not only the case, but also the quality of results can be severely degraded even after the iteration.

Existing convex programming based methods are too expensive and thus are ruled out for realistic application. Other methods based on iteratively fixing the passivity through perturbing the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix either suffer from convergence issue or lack optimality which will sometimes lead to unacceptable error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for macro-modeling. In addition to the traditional two-stage (fixing plus enforcement) schemes, we propose a post-enforcement optimization, which takes a passive, while potentially not-so-accurate model, as the starting point, and performs local search to find the local optimum with passivity constraint or build-in passivity guarantee. A simple yet stable passive modeling generator is proposed to produce the starting model for optimization. Two algorithms are proposed for performing constrained and unconstrained optimizations. Experiments show that the accuracy of passivity-fixed model can be significantly improved with the proposed methods.The main problems of such algorithms are 1) The perturbation process does not guarantee convergence. Each step of perturbation, though will move some imaginary eigenvalues away from the axis, will potentially move other eigenvalues to the imaginary axis and thus introduce new passivity violations. 2) Even if the enforcement procedure stops with a passive model, the error could be large. This is because each step of the enforcement is aiming at minimizing the perturbation instead of minimizing the model error. After a few steps of iterations, the model error will generally be accumulated, and eventually it could be quite large. In this paper we propose to perform an additional refinement step to improve the accuracy of a passive model while still guarantee the passivity. The input to the proposed algorithms is a passive, while not-so-accurate starti- - ng model. This is different from existing passivity enforcement schemes, in which the input is an accurate, but not passive system. The starting passive model can be provided with any of the existing enforcement techniques, or with some simpler (and more stable) approaches that will be introduced later. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the mathematical background of the problem, and review exiting methods for passivity constrained macro-modeling. Section 3 presents the framework for the proposed three-stage passive macro-modeling. Section 4 and 5 presents two schemes for post enforcement optimization. Results and conclusions will be given in Sections 6 and 7.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981975","Macro modeling;optimization;passivity;vector fitting","Accuracy;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Optimization;Programming;Transfer functions","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling","convex programming based methods;passive macro-modeling;passive modeling generator;passivity enforcement;post-enforcement optimization","","0","","14","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But due to overlay errors, it is very difficult for DEDP to print even 1D features. A more promising DPL technology is self-aligned double patterning (SADP) for 1D design. SADP first prints dense lines and then trims away the portions not on the design by a cut mask. The complexity of cut mask is very high, adding to the skyrocketing manufacturing cost. In this paper we present a mask cost reduction method with circuit performance consideration for SADP. This is the first paper to focus on the mask cost reduction issue for SADP from a design perspective. We simplify the polygons on the cut mask, by formulating the problem as a constrained shortest path problem.

This paper introduces COBE, an electrical bug modeling technique which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of validation tests and DfD (design-for-debug) structures for detecting these errors in post-silicon validation. COBE first uses gate-level timing details to identify critical flip-flops in which the error effects of electrical bugs are more likely to be captured. Based on RTL simulation traces, the functional tests and corresponding cycles in which these critical flip-flops incur transitions are then recorded as the potential times and locations of bug activation. These selected “bit-flips” are then analyzed through functional simulation to determine if they are propagated to an observation point for detection. Compared to the commonly employed random bit-flip injection technique, COBE provides a significantly more accurate electrical bug model by taking into account the likelihood of bug activation, in terms of both location and time, for bit-flip injection. COBE is experimentally evaluated on an Alpha 21264 processor RTL model. In our simulation-based experiments, the results show that the relative effectiveness of the tests predicted by COBE correlates very well with the tests' electrical bug detection capability, with a correlation factor of 0.921. This method is much more accurate than the random bit-flip injection technique, which has a correlation factor of 0.482.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722197","","Circuit faults;Computer bugs;Correlation;Delay;Observability;Testing","design for testability;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit testing;logic design;logic testing","Alpha 21264 processor RTL model;COBE technique;DfD structure;RTL simulation;bug activation;correlation factor;crosstalk;design-for-debug structure;error detection;flip-flop;functional simulation;functional test;gate-level timing;post-silicon bug detection;post-silicon validation;power droop;random bit-flip injection;shrinking noise margin;validation test;variation induced electrical bug","","2","","10","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these faults, NoC routing schemes can be enhanced by adding fault tolerance capabilities, so that they can adapt communication flows to follow fault-free paths. A majority of existing fault tolerant routing algorithms are based on the turn model approach due to its simplicity and inherent freedom from deadlock. However, these turn model based algorithms are either too restrictive in the choice of paths that flits can traverse, or are tailored to work efficiently only on very specific fault distribution patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel fault tolerant routing scheme (NS-FTR) for NoC architectures that combines the North-last and South-last turn models to create a robust hybrid NoC routing scheme.

However, in modern VLSI designs, pins are located in multiple routing layers, each routing layer has its own preferred direction, and there exist numerous routing obstacles incurred from IP blocks, power networks, pre-routed nets, etc, which make us need to consider multilayer obstacle-avoiding preferred direction rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (ML-OAPDRSMT) problem. This significantly increases the complexity of the problem, and an efficient and effective algorithm to deal with the problem is desired. In this paper, we propose a very simple and effective approach to deal with ML-OAPDRSMT problem. Unlike previous works usually build a spanning graph and find a spanning tree to deal with this problem, which takes a lot of time, we first determine a connection ordering for all pins, and then iteratively connect every two neighboring pins by a greedy heuristic algorithm.

Timing corner mismatch between tiers is caused because each tier is manufactured in independent process. Therefore, inter-die variation should be considered to analyze and optimize for paths spreading over several tiers. TSV induced stress is another challenge in 3D Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS). Mobility variation of a clock buffer due to stress from TSV can cause unexpected skew which degrades overall chip performance. In this paper, we propose clock tree design methodology with the following objectives: (a) to minimize clock period variation by assigning optimal z-location of clock buffers with an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation, (b) to prevent unwanted skew induced by the stress. In the results, we show that our clock buffer tier assignment reduces clock period variation up to 34.2%, and the most of stress-induced skew can be removed by our stress-aware CTS.

In this paper, we propose a discrete voltage assignment algorithm for sequential circuit under clock scheduling. The sequential MSV assignment problem is first formulated as a convex cost dual network flow problem, which can be optimally solved in polynomial time assuming delay of each gate can be chosen in continuous domain. Then a mincut-based heuristic is designed to convert the unfeasible continuous solution into feasible discrete solution while largely preserving the global optimality. Besides, we revisit the hardness of the general discrete voltage assignment problem and point out some misunderstandings on the approximability of this problem in previous related work. Benchmark test for our algorithm shows 9.2% reduction in power consumption on average, in compared with combinational MSV assignment.

However, imbalanced interconnect latency and communication back-pressure residing in an LIS still degrade system throughput. In this paper, we present a throughput optimization technique with minimal queue insertion. We first model a given LIS as a quantitative graph (QG), which can be further compacted using the proposed techniques, so that much bigger problems can be handled. On top of QG, the optimal solution with minimal queue size can be achieved through integer linear programming based on the proposed constraint formulation in an acceptable runtime.

In addition, the yield of 3D integrated circuits decreased dramatically as the number of TSVs increases. For symmetric 3D mesh NoC, we observe that the TSVs' utilization is pretty low and adjacent routers rarely transmit packets via their vertical channels (i.e. TSVs) at the same time.

However, the erroneous results will be corrected either during the current or later stages by injecting other clock gating conditions to cancel out each other's error effects before they reach the primary outputs. Under this model, conditions across multiple flip-flop stages can also be analyzed to locate easily correctable erroneous clock gating conditions.

Towards this goal, an efficient statistical algorithm is derived to efficiently estimate the information density and then optimize the memory system for maximum-information storage. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a traditional 6-T SRAM cell designed in a commercial 45nm CMOS process, the proposed MIMS design can successfully operate at an extremely low power supply voltage (i.e., 0.6 V) and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 20 dB compared to the traditional SRAM design.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981951","Integrated Circuit;Memory;Process Variation","Arrays;Maintenance engineering;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Signal to noise ratio","CMOS memory circuits;SRAM chips;information storage;redundancy","6-T SRAM cell;CMOS process;SRAM design;maximum-information memory system;maximum-information storage;memory redundancy;nanoscale manufacturing technology;optimal bit cell repair;size 45 nm","","0","","15","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parallel simulation aims to accelerate the simulation speed by running component simulators concurrently.

In this paper we propose a technique to configure the simulation environment optimally considering the application characteristics. Particularly, we focus on three design axes, simulation platform selection, mapping of component simulators to participating host processors and period of null message transfer for time synchronization. As a result, the proposed technique enables the efficient exploitation of parallelism by 1) well-balanced distribution of simulation workloads to host processors and 2) the minimized overhead for null message transfer, in turn, leading to the maximal simulation performance.

For a 4-layer implementation of an SRAM register in 45nm technology, we show that improving the TSV yield from 20% to 90% requires layout modifications that worsen register's performance up to four times. Moreover, the same 4-layer register that performs three times as fast as its single layer equivalent at 20% yield becomes twice slower at 70% yield when layout effects are considered.

Different from previous works on TSV planning which ignored the effects of leakage power, in this paper, we integrate temperature-leakage-timing dependence into thermal via planning of 3D ICs. A weighted via insertion approach, considering both performance and heat dissipation with resource constraint, is proposed to achieve the best balance among delay, via number and temperature. Experiment results show that, with leakage power and resource constraint considered the temperature and via number required can be quite different, and weighted TSV insertion approach can improve thermal via number, by about 5.6%.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722195","","Delay;Heating;Planning;Temperature dependence;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias;Tiles","cooling;leakage currents;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging);three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC;3D designs;TSV insertion approach;TSV planning;heat dissipation;heat removal;leakage delay;leakage power;performance improvement;power density;resource constraint;routing congestions;temperature-leakage-timing dependence;thermal conductivity;thermal via number;thermal via planning;through-silicon-vias;timing-power-temperature dependence;via insertion approach","","3","","18","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is hence likely that the product is not reliable or energy-efficient from particular customers' point of view. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel customer-aware task allocation and scheduling technique, wherein we generate an initial task schedule for each execution mode at design stage and then perform online adjustment at regular intervals for lifetime reliability improvement and/or energy reduction according to the specific usage strategy of individual products.

"Lithography at 14nm and beyond: Choices and challenges","Singh, Vivek","Intel Corp. (USA), Hillsboro, OR, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","459","459","As the gap between the lithography wavelength and critical feature size has continued to increase, the semiconductor industry has had to adjust. Previously, scaling along Moore's Law had relied on improvement in lithography equipment, occasionally by reducing the wavelength and frequently by improving the effective numerical aperture. The wavelength used to define critical dimensions during much of the nineties was 248nm, with the industry switching to 193nm in the following decade. After 157nm technology failed to materialize due to technological challenges, the focus of next generation lithography (NGL) research shifted to EUV. Meanwhile, 193nm continued to be the workhorse for the continuation of Moore's Law. The next big equipment advancement came with immersion steppers, which “increased” the effective aperture of the lens, thereby capturing more of the diffraction orders in the imaging process. Moore's Law, however requires a significant innovation every two years! With optical lithography wavelength and effective lens aperture stretched to these limits, double patterning came to the rescue. By splitting the pattern into two, the burden on each mask was somewhat reduced, allowing a “stitched” pattern to scale. All through these changes, continued scaling also required a tighter co-optimization between process and design. As the image quality became generally weaker, greater restrictions were placed on the diversity of features that could be robustly patterned, leading to the proverbial increase in the heft of design rule manuals. All through these heroic efforts to continue Moore's Law, in order to reap the resulting benefits to the electronics industry, a relatively new field called Computational Lithography has been providing a helping hand. Computational Lithography comprises a broad set of techniques that use physics-based calculations to eke out greater lithographic performance from a given generation of steppers. This- fertile field has recently introduced two advanced features: inverse lithography, and source-mask optimization. Such techniques have helped extend the life of optical lithography beyond previously forecast durations. At the same time, as other lithography technologies become more mature, much of the computational infrastructure developed to extend optical lithography will likely be used to optimize the newer technologies. This paper will provide some examples of how Computational Lithography is creating novel and affordable solutions to sustain the scaling trend.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981847","Lithography","Apertures;Electronics industry;Lithography;Optical imaging","lithography;semiconductor industry","Computational Lithography;EUV;Moore law;NGL;next generation optical lithography wavelength;physics-based calculations;semiconductor industry;size 14 nm;source-mask optimization","","0","","","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis and design of such shapers allows for dynamically variable streams of jobs; for instance, periodic streams with jitter. We extend our results to consider non-zero power and timing overhead in transitioning to the idle mode.

Consequently, this paper presents the first work to perform simultaneous functional and timing ECO. We use an augmented bipartite graph to model both types of ECO. In addition, through comprehensive constant insertion and bridging, the functional capability of each spare cell is enhanced, thus facilitating spare cell selection. Experimental results show that our simultaneous functional and timing ECO engine can successfully resolve mixed functional and timing ECO that is unsolvable by the sequential scheme.

For example, side channel attacks such as differential cryptanalysis can easily and noninvasively extract secrets from unprotected SoCs. Vulnerabilities can be difficult to anticipate, since common design and verification tools do not necessarily provide clear visibility into how devices will fail when pushed outside of its normal operational conditions. The security challenges facing the semiconductor industry are also in part educational; while security training is common for software developers, relatively few hardware engineers have specialized security knowledge.

We propose an approach to correct the grid, in case some voltage drops violate the threshold condition, by making minor changes to the original design. Previous work has been done in on the DC model of the grid and this paper deals with the transient model. Rather than directly reducing the steady state voltage drops below the threshold we work on reducing the first time step voltage drops. The method uses current constraints proposed in to find the first time step voltage drop whose distance to the corresponding threshold is the largest. It then tries to estimate it as a function of the metal widths on the grid. A non-linear optimization problem is then formulated and the required metal line width changes that reduce the first time step voltage drops by a sufficient amount are then determined. The reduction of the first time step voltage drop by that amount will make the steady state voltage drops of all the nodes less than the threshold.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981989","Power Grid;sensitivity;voltage drop","Metals;Power grids;Robustness;Safety;Steady-state;Threshold voltage;Upper bound","nonlinear programming;power grids;sensitivity analysis","RC model;nonlinear optimization problem;power grid correction;sensitivity analysis;transient model","","0","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particularly problematic is the case when the accumulation of permanent hardware faults leads to disconnected cores in the system. In order to maintain correct system operation, it is necessary to salvage the data from these isolated nodes. In this work, we introduce a recovery mechanism targeting precisely this issue: DRAIN (Distributed Recovery Architecture for Inaccessible Nodes) provides system-level recovery from permanent failures. When an error disconnects a node from the network, DRAIN uses emergency links to transfer architectural state and cached data from disconnected nodes to nearby connected caches. DRAIN incurs zero performance penalty during normal operation, and is compatible with any cache coherence protocol, interconnect topology or routing protocol. Experimental results show that DRAIN is able to provide complete state recovery within several milliseconds, on average, for a 1GHz 64-node CMP at an area overhead of only a few thousand gates.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981885","Fault-Tolerance;Network-on-Chip;Recovery;Resilient Systems","Hardware;Logic gates;Network topology;Radiation detectors;Reliability;Routing;Topology","computer architecture;fault tolerant computing;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","1GHz 64-node CMP;DRAIN;Distributed Recovery Architecture for Inaccessible Nodes;cache coherence protocol;distributed recovery architecture;multicore chip;network on chip;recovery mechanism;routing protocol;silicon reliability;system level recovery;transfer architectural state;zero performance penalty","","5","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing approaches primarily target application-driven partitioning of the shared cache to alleviate inter-core cache interference so that both performance and energy efficiency are improved. Dynamic cache reconfiguration is a promising technique in reducing energy consumption of the cache subsystem for uniprocessor systems. In this paper, we present a novel energy optimization technique which employs both dynamic reconfiguration of private caches and partitioning of the shared cache for multicore systems with real-time tasks. Our static profiling based algorithm is designed to judiciously find beneficial cache configurations (of private caches) for each task as well as partition factors (of the shared cache) for each core so that the energy consumption is minimized while task deadline is satisfied. Experimental results using real benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve 29.29% energy saving on average compared to systems employing only cache partitioning.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981887","Multicore systems;cache;dynamic reconfiguration;energy optimization;real-time systems","Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Multicore processing;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Program processors;Real time systems","cache storage;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","chip multiprocessors;dynamic cache partitioning;dynamic cache reconfiguration;energy consumption reduction;energy optimization technique;real-time multicore systems;static profiling based algorithm;uniprocessor systems","","3","","28","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CuMAPz can help programmers explore different ways of using shared and global memories, and optimize their program for memory behavior. CuMAPz models several memory effects, e.g., data reuse, global memory access coalescing, shared memory bank conflict, channel skew, and branch divergence.

The electrostatic interactions between a molecule and solvent are particularly difficult to model theoretically, due to the forces' long range and the collective response of many thousands of solvent molecules. The dominant modeling approaches represent the two extremes of the trade-off between molecular realism and computational efficiency: all-atom molecular dynamics in explicit solvent, and macroscopic continuum theory (the Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equation). We present the first fast-solver implementation of an advanced nonlocal continuum theory that combines key advantages of both approaches. In particular, molecular realism is included by limiting solvent dielectric response on short length scales, using a model for nonlocal dielectric response allows the resulting problem (a linear integro-differential Poisson equation) to be reformulated as a system of coupled boundary-integral equations using double reciprocity. Whereas previous studies using the nonlocal theory had been limited to small model problems, owing to computational cost, our work opens the door to studying much larger problems including rational drug design, protein engineering, and nanofluidics.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982001","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Electric potential;Electrostatics;Equations;Mathematical model;Solvents","Boltzmann equation;Poisson equation;boundary integral equations;electrostatics;macromolecules;molecular biophysics;molecular dynamics method","Poisson-Boltzmann equation;all-atom molecular dynamics;biological molecules;biomolecular engineering;biomolecular science;boundary-integral equations;double reciprocity;electrostatic interactions;linear integro-differential Poisson equation;macroscopic continuum theory;molecular realism;nonlocal dielectric response;nonlocal electrostatic theory","","0","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new approach to bound the magnitude of intermittent timing errors at the circuit level by introducing a guard-band over which timing errors are safely mitigated. The guard-band is achieved by shaping the path delay distribution such that the critical paths correspond to a group of LSB result registers. These end-points are ensured to be critical by modifying the topology of the final stage carry-merge adder and by using tool-based device sizing. Hence, timing violations lead to weakly correlated logical errors of small magnitude in a mean-squared-error sense. We applied this approach to a digital filter in 32nm CMOS.

Previous works such as simulation based estimation method or analytical method that focused on estimation of low level throughput in link layer are not adequate for accurately estimating throughput of the real silicon SoC because practical use cases of such complex connectivity blocks typically require extensive software operation on top of platform operating systems like Linux. FPGA-based emulation, therefore, is commonly used to verify functional correctness of complex connectivity blocks in a more realistic usage scenario with real connectivity devices like USB 2.0 mass storage devices. Speed of FPGA emulation, though, is scaled down significantly because of inherent limitation of FPGA emulation while speed of interface to real connectivity devices is required to be at-speed for compliance with connectivity specification standards. For this reason, scaling factors of speed are not uniform and, thus, measurement of performance is not accurate. This paper proposes a method to compensate errors due to the non-uniform scaling factors. In the proposed method, measurements of various parameters in FPGA emulation are applied to a high-accuracy estimation model that we created.

Unfortunately, the static power consumption of MCML standard cells is significantly higher compared to equivalent functions implemented using static CMOS logic. As a result, the use of such a logic style is very limited in portable devices. Paradoxically, these devices are the most sensitive to physical attacks, thus the ones which would benefit more from the adoption of MCML. We propose to overcome this limitation by reducing drastically the static power consumption of MCML-based cryptographic circuits. To this end, we designed Power Gated MCML (PG-MCML), a standard cell library featuring a sleep transistor in every cell. The effects of the sleep transistor on performance as well as on area are negligible. Moreover, the proposed differential library is supported by conventional EDA tools. We evaluated our standard cell library using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as benchmark and we compared the power consumption, the area, and the DPA-resistance figures with the ones of static CMOS and conventional MCML. Our results show that our PG-MCML library can achieve a power consumption comparable with the one of static CMOS, thus proving that PG-MCML cells can suit the strict power budget of battery operated devices.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982021","Current Mode Logic;DPA;Security;Side Channel Attacks","CMOS integrated circuits;Delay;Libraries;Logic gates;Power demand;Switching circuits;Transistors","CMOS logic circuits;cryptography;current-mode logic;power aware computing","CMOS logic;EDA tools;MCML-based cryptographic circuits;advanced encryption standard;power analysis attacks;power aware DPA-resistant standard cell library;power-gated MOS current mode logic;sleep transistor","","0","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The naive solution using double-TSV can alleviate the problem. But the significant area overhead renders it less practical for large designs. In this paper, we propose a novel TSV fault-tolerant unit (TFU) that can provide tolerance against TSV failures in a 3D clock network. It makes use of the existing 2D redundant trees designed for pre-bond testing, and thus has minimum area overhead. Compared to the double TSV technique, the 3D clock network constructed by our TFUs can achieve 61% area reduction with 3.9% yield rate improvement on an industrial case.

Measurement results of a 65nm test chip show that the adaptive speed control can compensate PVT variations and improve energy efficiency by up to 46% compared to the worst-case design and operation with guardbanding.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722199","","Adders;Delay;Error analysis;Monitoring;Power dissipation;Velocity control","integrated circuit manufacture;sensors","die-to-die process variation;environmental fluctuation;on-chip sensors;random process variation;run-time adaptive performance compensation;run-time adaptive performance control;size 65 nm;timing errors","","0","1","15","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Native co-simulation has been proposed as a fast solution for evaluating systems in early design steps. Annotated SW execution can be performed in conjunction with a virtual model of the HW platform to generate a complete system simulation. To obtain sufficiently accurate performance estimations, the effect of all the system components, as processor caches, must be considered. ISS-based cache models slow down the simulation speed, greatly reducing the efficiency of native-based co-simulations. To solve the problem, cache modeling techniques for fast native co-simulation have been proposed, but only considering instruction-caches. In this paper, a fast technique for data-cache modeling is presented, together with the instrumentation required for its application in native execution. The model allows the designer to obtain cache hit/miss rate estimations with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude with respect to ISS. Miss rate estimation error remains below 5% for representative examples.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722227","Cache modelling;Electronic System Level;Embedded SW","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Data models;Embedded systems;Estimation;Memory management","cache storage;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems","complete system simulation;data-cache modeling;multiprocessor embedded systems;native co-simulation","","6","","25","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since such input signal values are usually a small subset of the entire input sequence, we can reproduce the error by simulation using them. To realize DSC, we propose a variable named d-tag (Dependency Tag) representing dependency of a signal value with respect to another signal value. For demonstrating our method, we prepared three design examples and implemented DSC circuits on them. As a result, we could successfully extract input signal values that influenced the target output value from a number of random input sequence, for every case. We observed that the number of the extracted input values was significantly smaller than that of the original sequence. The area overhead for DSC circuit were also practical, 4 % in average.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722280","","Clocks;Computer architecture;Debugging;Equations;Observability;Registers;System-on-a-chip","network analysis","dependency tag;dynamic slicing circuit;efficient post-silicon debugging;erroneous output value;on-chip circuitry;on-chip dynamic signal sequence slicing;random input sequence;signal value","","2","","11","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is well known that the sub-threshold device sizing is different from super-threshold due to different current behavior. The previously reported sub-threshold sizing methods assume that the current is proportional to the transistor width. However, we have found that the inverse narrow width effect has a significant influence on the threshold voltage in the sub-threshold region, causing non-proportional current-width relationship. Sizing without considering this effect may result in significant imbalance in the rise and fall delay which degrades the performance, power consumption and the functional yield of the design. We have proposed a new sub-threshold sizing method to balance the rise and fall delay by taking into account the influence of inverse narrow width effect while minimizing the transistor size. Compared with the previous sub-threshold sizing method the delay and power-delay-product (PDP) are reduced by up to 35.4% and 73.4% with up to 57% saving in the area. Further, due to symmetric rise and fall delay the minimum operating voltage can be lowered by 8% which leads to another 16% of energy reduction.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722196","","Delay;Logic gates;MOS devices;Power demand;Stacking;Threshold voltage;Transistors","MOSFET;low-power electronics","inverse narrow width effect;nonproportional current-width relationship;power consumption;power delay product;subthreshold device sizing;transistor width","","4","","9","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As interconnects dominate the path delay, physical synthesis such as buffer insertion and gate sizing has to integrate with layer assignment. Layer directives - commonly generated during wire synthesis to meet tight frequency targets - play a critical role in reducing interconnect delay of smaller technology nodes. Unfortunately, they are not presently understood or honored by leading global routers, nor do existing techniques trivially extend toward their resolution. The shortcomings contribute to a dangerous blindspot in optimization and timing closure, leading to unroutable and/or underperforming designs. In this paper, we aim to resolve the layer compliance problem in routing congestion evaluation and global routing, which is very critical for timing closure with physical synthesis. We propose a method of progressive projection to account for wire tags and layer directives, in which classes of nets are successively applied and locked while performing partial aggregation. The method effectively models the resource contention of layer constraints by faithfully accumulating capacity of bounded layer ranges, enabling three-dimensional assignment to subsequently achieve complete directive compliance. The approach is general, and can piggyback on existing interfaces used to communicate with popular academic engines. Empirical results on the IC-CAD 2009 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach successfully routes many designs that are otherwise unroutable with existing techniques and naïve approaches.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722249","","Benchmark testing;Delay;Metals;Routing;Three dimensional displays;Wire","VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;optimisation","interconnect delay;optimization;routing engines;tight frequency targets;timing closure;wire synthesizable global routing","","2","1","28","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data-driven machine-learning techniques are major enablers for the modeling and interpretation of such states. Their computational energy, however, scales with the complexity of the required models. In this paper, we propose a low-energy, biomedical computation platform optimized through the use of an accelerator for data-driven classification. The accelerator retains selective flexibility through hardware reconfiguration and exploits voltage scaling and parallelism to operate at a sub-threshold minimum-energy point. Using cardiac arrhythmia detection algorithms with patient data from the MIT-BIH database, classification is achieved in 2.96 μJ (at V<sub>dd</sub> = 0.4 V), over four orders of magnitude smaller than that on a low-power general-purpose processor. The energy of feature extraction is 148 μJ while retaining flexibility for a range of possible biomarkers.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981857","","Biomarkers;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Kernel;Multiplexing;Polynomials;Support vector machines","computerised monitoring;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical signal processing;microcomputers;pattern classification","MIT-BIH database;cardiac arrhythmia detection algorithm;closed loop chronic biomedical systems;complex physiological states;computational energy;data driven biomedical monitoring algorithm;data driven classification;data driven machine learning techniques;hardware reconfiguration;low energy biomedical computation platform;low energy computation platform;low power general purpose processor;patient signals;subthreshold minimum energy point","","1","","23","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The state-of-the-art reordering algorithms are based on transpositions of consecutive variables (swaps). Exact algorithms enumerate all possible n! permutations by performing a series of at least n! - 1 swaps, while heuristics typically either search for the optimum location of each variable independently (sifting) or utilize exact algorithms as a subroutine (k-window.) In this work we reduce the problem of variable ordering to that of obtaining a permutation enumeration transposition network. Our proposed network avoids traversing all n! permutations by exploiting structural properties of BDDs and requires the execution of fewer than 4<sup>n</sup> swaps sequentially instead of n! - 1. For the practically interesting cases of n = 4; 5 our algorithm requires only 11 (resp 59) sequential swaps instead of 23 (resp 119).

This implies that for the introduction of Ethernet a gateway to currently existing automotive networking technologies is required for achieving a smooth migration. Within this paper a concept for such a gateway maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) offered by the existing automotive networks is proposed.

Wear leveling techniques were proposed to extend its lifetime by balancing writes traffic. Another important concern that need to be considered is endurance variation in PRAM chips. When different PRAM cells have distinct endurance, balanced writes will result in lifetime degradation due to the weakest cells. Instead of balancing writes traffic, in this paper we propose wear rate leveling (WRL), a variant of wear leveling, to balance wear rates (i.e., writes traffic/edudrance) of cells across the PRAM chip. After investigating writing behavior of applications and endurance variation, we propose an architecture-level WRL mechanism. Moreover, there is an important tradeoff between endurance improvement and swapping data volume. To co-optimize endurance and swapping, a novel algorithm, Max Hyper-weight Rematching, is proposed to maximize PRAM lifetime and minimize performance degradation. Experimental results show 19x endurance improvement to prior Wear Leveling.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982017","PRAM endurance;wear leveling;wear rate leveling","Complexity theory;Degradation;Phase change random access memory;Prediction algorithms;Programming;Systematics;Writing","phase change memories;wear","PRAM lifetime enhancement;PRAM-based main memory;architecture-level WRL mechanism;endurance variation;max hyper-weight rematching algorithm;phase change random access memory;wear rate leveling techniques","","2","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As flash plays a more important role, data integrity in flash memories becomes a critical question. This paper examines one aspect of that data integrity by measuring the types of errors that occur when power fails during a flash memory operation. Our findings demonstrate that power failure can lead to several non-intuitive behaviors. We find that increasing the time before power failure does not always reduce error rates and that a power failure during a program operation can corrupt data that a previous, successful program operation wrote to the device. Our data also show that interrupted program operations leave data more susceptible to read disturb and increase the probability that the programmed data will decay over time. Finally, we show that incomplete erase operations make future program operations to the same block unreliable.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981701","flash memory;power failure;power loss","Ash;Bit error rate;Encoding;Programming;Reliability;Semiconductor device measurement","computer power supplies;data integrity;flash memories","computer systems;data integrity;flash memory;flash-based solid-state drives;interrupted program operations;mission-critical server systems;music players;power failure;power loss","","0","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While such assumptions may hold when profiling certain classes of variations, a number of recent modeling studies suggest that non-stationarities arise from both shifts in the process mean as well as fluctuations in the variance of the process. In order to provide a compact model for non-stationary process variations, we introduce a new hybrid spatial modeling framework that models the spatially varying random field as a union of non-overlapping rectangular regions where the process is assumed to be locally-stationary within each region. To estimate the parameters in our hybrid spatial model, we develop a host of techniques to both estimate the change-points in the random field and to find an appropriate partitioning of the chip into disjoint regions where the field is locally-stationary.

The JOP, inherently suited to data-driven transformational operations, is extended to efficiently execute the control constructs and control flow of SystemJ. The new core, which is called RJOP (Reactive JOP) supports efficient execution of both data dominated and control dominated embedded applications.

(KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20110811","2011","","","134","139","A processor's performance and power consumption are tied; an increased performance demands more power, and vice versa. An optimal tradeoff can only be achieved by an improved prediction of the task execution times, prior to an efficient scheduling. Moreover, since the processor's soft error rate is a function of its operating voltage, it is also linked to the performance-power trade-off. The situation is further complicated for the case of multicore architectures where the tasks are to be mapped on separate cores (processing elements). This paper proposes a joint State-Space model to achieve improved task execution time estimation, leading to better scheduling for optimizing the trade-off, particularly in the context of multicore soft real-time systems. It does not assume any `a priori' knowledge about the task graph or its properties, and is independent of the underlying architecture. It learns the system dynamics over time. The state-space solution is formulated using a recursive implementation of the online Monte Carlo Method. Having obtained the estimates of the execution times, they are compensated for the soft error according to a given soft error rate. At the beginning of each scheduling interval, the low power EDF scheduling decision is carried out to execute the tasks. The proposed method (SEAL) achieves 29% better energy savings compared to state-of-the-art, while the deadline misses are under 7% without the loss of system failure probability. The results obtained clearly show the advantage in terms of energy savings.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981709","Monte Carlo;Multicore;Soft error;Software pipeline;Task-execution time;low-power scheduling","Decoding;Estimation;Mathematical model;Monte Carlo methods;Multicore processing;Scheduling;Seals","Monte Carlo methods;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;power consumption;scheduling","Monte Carlo state space;SEAL;joint state-space model;low power EDF scheduling;optimal tradeoff;power consumption;processors performance;soft error aware low power scheduling;stochastic spatial and temporal dependencies;task execution time estimation","","0","","23","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although running a few corners, which are chosen beforehand, can lead to acceptable results in some cases, this is not always the case. Our results show that in the case of setup timing analysis, one can indeed bound circuit slacks across all corners by running a small number of corners. On the other hand, we show that this is not possible in the case of hold analysis. Instead, we present an alternative method for performing fast and accurate hold timing analysis which covers all corners. In this method a full timing run is performed for a small number of corners, and partial timing runs, which cover only the clock network, are performed for others. We then combine the results of the full and partial runs to find the worst-case hold slacks over all corners.

A less universal, but still vexing, subtlety arises when an oscillator is described by a system of differential equations with “hidden” conservation constraints (HCC's); defined as weighted sums of state variables that are time-invariant. If there are HCC's, as is commonly the case for models of biochemical oscillators but rarely the case for practical circuit oscillators, the now-standard approach to computing parametric sensitivities can yield incorrect results. In addition, the monodromy matrix (the matrix of state sensitivities over one oscillation period), is often defective in a way that interferes with the usual approach to computing oscillator phase noise. In this paper we analyze the HCC case, and show that by augmenting the standard sensitivity approach with explicit HCC's, one can recover the correct parametric sensitivities.

Then the frequency response bounds (maximum and minimum) are obtained by performing analysis of a finite number of transfer functions given by the Kharitonov's polynomial functions.

Hence, it is essential for system designers to find the appropriate mix of resources, living within the constraints, for a desired output video quality. A naive approach to do this would be to run expensive system simulations of the decoder tasks mapped onto a model of the underlying MPSoC architecture. This turns out to be inefficient when the input video library set has a large number of video clips. We propose a fast hybrid simulation framework to quantitatively estimate decoded video quality in the context of an MPEG-2 decoder. Here, the workload of simulation heavy tasks are estimated using accurate analytical models. The workload of other light (but difficult to analytically model) tasks are obtained from system simulations. This framework enables the system designer to perform a fast trade-off analysis of the system resources in order to choose the optimal combination of resources for the desired video quality. When compared to a naive system simulation approach, the hybrid simulation-based framework shows speed-up factors of about 5× for motion and 8× for still videos. The results obtained using this framework highlight important trade-offs such as the decoded video quality (measured in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR)) vs buffer size and PSNR vs processor frequency.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722190","","Computational modeling;Decoding;Estimation;PSNR;Streaming media;Training;Transform coding","system-on-chip;video codecs;video coding","MPEG-2 decoder;MPSoC platform;PSNR;accurate decoded video quality assessment;buffer size;fast hybrid simulation;multimedia decoder;peak signal to noise ratio;processor frequency;resource constraint;system designer","","1","","9","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to minimize via count and via overflow during layer assignment has received considerable attention in recent years. Traditional layer assignment to minimize via count tends to produce varying qualities of assignment results using different net orderings. This work develops a negotiation-based via count minimization algorithm (NVM) that can achieve lower via counts than in previous works, and experimental results indicate that net assignment ordering only slightly influences the quality of NVM's results. As for via overflow minimization, we observe via overflow can be well minimized if via overflow minimization is performed following stacked via minimization. The stacked via minimization adopts the proposed NVM, while via overflow minimization adopts a modified NVM by replacing via cost with via overflow cost. Experimental results reveal that the proposed NVM yields a lower additional via cost than and by 10.8%, 2.5%, respectively, in the via count minimization problem. As for via overflow minimization, the proposed two-stage algorithm improves via overflow by 11.5% and lowers the via cost by 6.5% than the one-stage algorithm.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722248","","Decision support systems","minimisation;network routing","negotiation-based layer assignment;negotiation-based via count minimization algorithm;net assignment ordering;one-stage algorithm;stacked via minimization;via overflow cost;via overflow minimization","","6","","13","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its nature, list scheduling is oblivious of the tightly coupled register pressure; a dangling fundamental problem that has been attacked by the compiler community for decades, and which results, in case of highlevel synthesis, in excessive instantiations of registers and accompanying steering logic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a synthesis framework called soft scheduling, which acts as a resource unconstrained pre-scheduling stage that restricts subsequent scheduling to minimize register pressure. This optimization objective is formulated as a live range minimization problem, a measure shown to be proportional to register pressure, and optimally solved in polynomial time using minimum cost network flow formulation. Unlike past solutions in the compiler community, which try to reduce register pressure by local serialization of subject instructions, the proposed solution operates on the entire basic block or hyperblock and systematically handles instruction chaining subject to the same objective. The application of the proposed solution to a set of real-life benchmarks results in a register pressure reduction ranging, on average, between 11% and 41% depending on the compilation and synthesis configurations with minor 2% to 4% increase in schedule latency.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722234","","Communities;Couplings;Optimization;Registers;Resource management;Schedules;Scheduling","high level synthesis;minimisation;processor scheduling;program compilers","high level synthesis;list scheduling;minimum cost network flow formulation;optimization objective;register pressure aware scheduling;soft scheduling","","1","","35","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the memory resource in embedded systems is often limited. This leads to the overhead of code retranslation and causes significant performance degradation. To reduce this overhead, Heterogeneous Code Cache (HCC), is proposed to split the code cache among SPM and main memory to avoid code re-translation. Although HCC is effective in handling applications with large working sets, it ignores the execution frequencies of program segments. Frequently executed program segments can be stored in main memory and suffer from large access latency. This causes significant performance loss. To address this problem, an enhanced Heterogeneous Code Cache management scheme which considers program behaviors is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed management scheme can effectively improve the access ratio of SPM from 49.48% to 95.06%.

The extent of NBTI degradation of a PMOS device increases dramatically at elevated operating temperature and supply voltage. Unfortunately, both these conditions are concurrently experienced by a VLSI chip during the process of burn-in testing. Our analysis shows that even with a short burn-in duration of 10 hours, the degradation accumulated can be as much as 60% of the NBTI degradation experienced over 10 years of use at nominal conditions. Static burn-in testing in particular is observed to cause most NBTI degradation due to absence of relaxation phase unlike the case for dynamic burn-in testing. The delay of benchmark circuits is observed to increase by over 10% due to static burn-in testing. We propose the first technique to reduce the NBTI degradation during static burn-in test by finding the minimum NBTI induced delay degradation vector (MDDV) based on timing criticality and threshold voltage change (ΔV<sub>TH</sub>) sensitivity of the cells. Further, only a subset of the input pins need to be controlled for NBTI reduction, thus our technique allows other objectives (such as leakage reduction) to be considered simultaneously. Experimental results show that the NBTI induced critical path delay degradation can be reduced by more than 50% using our proposed technique.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722259","","Degradation;Delay;Logic gates;MOS devices;Pins;Testing","MOS integrated circuits;VLSI;integrated circuit testing","PMOS device;benchmark circuit delay;critical path delay degradation;delay degradation vector;dynamic burn-in testing;nanometer VLSI chip;negative bias temperature instability degradation;relaxation phase;static burn-in testing;threshold voltage change sensitivity","","4","","22","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The uniqueness enables the power-up values to be considered as SRAM fingerprints used to verify device identities, which is a fundamental task in security applications. However, as the SRAM fingerprints are sensitive to environmental changes, there always exists a chance of error during the authentication process. Hence, the accuracy of a device authentication system with the SRAM fingerprints should be carefully estimated and verified in order to be implemented in practice. Consequently, a proper system evaluation method for the SRAM-based device authentication system should be provided. In this paper, we introduce tractable and computationally efficient system evaluation methods, which include novel parametric models for the distributions of matching distances among genuine and imposter devices. In addition, novel algorithms to calculate the confidence intervals of the estimates, which are crucial in system evaluation, are presented.

Parameter variations (process, voltage, and temperature) threaten continued performance scaling of power-constrained computer systems. As designers seek to contain the power consumption of microprocessors through reductions in supply voltage and power-saving techniques such as clock-gating, these systems suffer increasingly large power supply fluctuations due to the finite impedance of the power supply network. These supply fluctuations, referred to as voltage emergencies, must be managed to guarantee correctness. Traditional approaches to address this problem incur high-cost or compromise power/performance efficiency. Our research seeks ways to handle these alarm conditions through a combined hardware/software approach, motivated by root cause analysis of voltage emergencies revealing that many of these events are heavily linked to both program control flow and microarchitectural events (cache misses and pipeline flushes). This talk will discuss three aspects of the project: (1) a fail-safe mechanism that provides hardware guaranteed correctness; (2) a voltage emergency predictor that leverages control flow and microarchitectural event information to predict voltage emergencies up to 16 cycles in advance; and (3) a proof-of-concept dynamic compiler implementation that demonstrates that dynamic code transformations can be used to eliminate voltage emergencies from the instruction stream with minimal impact on performance..","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722200","","Automatic voltage control;Computer architecture;Hardware;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Software","alarm systems;hardware-software codesign;microcomputers;power aware computing;power consumption;power engineering computing;problem solving","alarms project;clock gating;dynamic code transformation;fail safe mechanism;finite impedance;hardware-software approach;microarchitectural event;parameter variation;power constrained computer system;power consumption;power performance efficiency;power saving technique;power supply fluctuation;power supply network;program control flow;proof-of-concept dynamic compiler;root cause analysis;voltage emergency;voltage emergency predictor","","0","","","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The minimum voltage of operation, V<sub>min</sub>, can be limited by any combination of write failure, read disturb failure, access failure and/or retention failure. Of these, the write failure is often observed as the major V<sub>min</sub> limiter in sub-50nm processes. In addition, the current generation transistors have high-k metal gate (HKMG) and these are prone to degradation due to higher level of electric field stress. The degradation increases V<sub>min</sub> due to increase in dynamic write failures and eventually, static write failures as the supply voltage decreases. We show that there exists a critical breakdown resistance (R<sub>crit</sub>) for a given supply voltage at which the SRAM write failure transitions from being dynamically limited to statically limited. For a 32nm low-power SRAM, the value of R<sub>crit</sub> increases by ~9X as the supply voltage reduces from 1V to 0.7V. Further, we show that the commonly used SRAM write-assist (WA) techniques do not lower R<sub>crit</sub> and can only improve the write-ability when the breakdown resistance, R<sub>sbd</sub>, is larger than R<sub>crit</sub>.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722278","","Degradation;Electric breakdown;Logic gates;Measurement;Random access memory;Resistance;Stability analysis","SRAM chips","SRAM array;SRAM dynamic;SRAM write failure transition;SRAM write-assist;critical breakdown resistance;dynamic write failure;electric field stress;embedded microprocessor;gate oxide degradation;generation transistor;low voltage operation;power consumption;static write failure;static write-ability;supply voltage","","1","","24","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a post-routing layer assignment algorithm for double patterning optimization. Our solution consists of three major phases: multi-layer assignment, single-layer double patterning, and via reduction. For phase one and three, multi-layer graph is constructed and dynamic programming is employed to solve optimization problem on this graph. In the second phase, single-layer double patterning is proved NP-hard and existing algorithm is implemented to optimize single layer double patterning problem. The proposed method is tested on CBL (Collaborative Benchmarking Laboratory) benchmarks and shows great performance. In comparison with single-layer double patterning, our method achieves 73% and 27% average reduction for unresolvable conflicts and stitches respectively, with only 9% increase of via number.

One popular method is PRIMA, a Krylov-subspace projection approach which preserves the passivity of positive semidefinite (PSD) structured DSs. However, system passivity is not guaranteed by PRIMA when the system is indefinite. Furthermore, the possible polynomial parts of singular systems are normally not captured. For indefinite DSs, positive-real balanced truncation (PRBT) can generate passive reduced-order models (ROMs), whose main bottleneck lies in solving the dual expensive generalized algebraic Riccati equations (GAREs). This paper presents a novel moment-matching MOR for indefinite DSs, which preserves both the system passivity and, if present, also the improper polynomial part. This method only requires solving one GARE, therefore it is cheaper than existing PRBT schemes. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm is capable of preserving the passivity of indefinite DSs, which is not guaranteed by traditional moment-matching MORs. Examples are finally presented showing that our method is superior to PRIMA in terms of accuracy.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722240","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Decision support systems;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Polynomials;Read only memory","Riccati equations;VLSI;electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;polynomials;reduced order systems","DS;GARE;Krylov-subspace projection approach;MOR;PRBT;PRIMA;PSD;ROM;VLSI interconnects;algebraic Riccati equation;indefinite descriptor system;moment-matching MOR;moment-matching scheme;on-chip passive;passivity-preserving model order reduction;polynomial parts;positive semideflnite;positive-real balanced truncation;reduced-order model","","0","","23","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a device-parameter estimation method with on-chip variation sensors explicitly considering random variability. The proposed method derives the global variation parameters and the standard deviation of the random variability using the maximum likelihood estimation.

Additionally, a few enhancement techniques including R-I curve skewing, yield-driven sensing current selection, and ratio matching are introduced to further improve the robustness of NSRS.

Second, read and write operations have asymmetric speed or power consumption in nonvolatile memory. This paper focuses on the embedded systems using non-volatile memory as main memory. We propose register allocation technique with re-computation to reduce the number of store instructions. When non-volatile memory is applied as the main memory, reducing store instructions will reduce write activities on non-volatile memory. With the proposed approach, the lifetime of non-volatile memory is extended accordingly.

The symbolic transadmittances of the device stamp share one BDD for storage saving. The modified nodal analysis (MNA) matrix formulated using symbolic stamp is of much lower dimension, hence it can be solved by a determinant decision diagram (DDD) with significantly reduced complexity.

Reconfiguration of the system during task execution affects both deadline miss rate and deadline miss distribution. On the other hand, Quality of Service (QoS) in several embedded applications is not only determined by deadline miss rate but also the distribution of the tasks missing their deadlines (known as weakly-hard real-time systems). As a result, we propose to model QoS constraints as a set of constraints on dropout patterns (due to reconfiguration overhead) and present a novel online solution for the problem of reconfiguration-aware real-time scheduling. According to QoS constraints, we divide the ready instances of the tasks into two groups: critical and non-critical, then model each group as a network flow problem and provide an online scheduler for each group. We deployed our method on synthetic benchmarks as well as software defined radio implementation of VoIP on reconfigurable systems. Results show that our solution reduces the number of QoS violations by 19.01 times and 2.33 times (57.02%) in comparison with Bi-Modal Scheduler (BMS) for synthetic benchmarks with low and high QoS constraint, respectively.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722174","","Benchmark testing;Hardware;Program processors;Protocols;Quality of service;Real time systems;Schedules","Internet telephony;embedded systems;quality of service;scheduling;software radio","VoIP;bi-modal scheduler;deadline miss distribution;deadline miss rate;embedded systems;network flow problem;quality of service;reconfiguration overheads;reconfiguration-aware real-time scheduling;software defined radio;task execution","","0","","14","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to mitigate these limitations, prior research focuses on reducing write intensity at the bit level. In this work, we study the data pattern of memory write operations, and explore the frequent-value locality in data written back to main memory. Based on the fact that many data are written to memory repeatedly, an architecture of frequent-value storage is proposed for PRAM memory. It can significantly reduce the write intensity to PRAM memory so that the lifetime is improved and the write energy is reduced. The trade-off between endurance and capacity of PRAM memory is explored for different configurations.

In order to integrate these devices into electronic systems, routing becomes a key issue. In this paper, the GNR routing problem is studied for the first time. We formulate the GNR routing problem as a minimum hybrid-cost shortest path problem on triangular mesh (“hybrid” means that we need to consider both the length and the bending of the routing path). In order to model this hybrid-cost problem, we apply graph expansion and introduce a shortest red-black path problem on the expanded graph. We then propose an algorithm that solves the shortest red-black path problem optimally. This algorithm is then used in a negotiated congestion based routing scheme. Experimental results show that our GNR routing algorithm effectively handles the hybrid cost.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722208","","Delay;Frequency control;Junctions;Logic gates;Resistance;Routing;Wire","graph theory;graphene;mesh generation;network routing","electronic system;graph expansion;graphene nanoribbon routing problem;hybrid-cost problem;minimum hybrid-cost shortest path problem;shortest red-black path problem;triangular mesh","","5","","19","","","25-28 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the first time, spatial and temporal stochastic and deterministic reliability effects are handled together in an efficient framework. The paper first introduces an equivalent transistor SPICE model, comprising the currently most important aging effects (i.e NBTI, hot carriers and soft breakdown). A simulation framework then uses this SPICE model to minimize the number of circuit factors and to build a circuit model. The latter allows for example very fast circuit yield analysis. Using experimental design techniques the proposed method is very efficient and also proves to be very flexible. The simulation technique is demonstrated on an example 6-bit current-steering DAC, where the creation of soft breakdown spots can result in circuit failure due to increasing time-dependent transistor mismatch.","1530-1591","978-1-61284-208-0","","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763206","Aging;Design for Reliability;Failure-Resilience;HBD;Hot Carrier Degradation;NBTI;SBD;TDDB","Electric breakdown;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit reliability;Logic gates;Stochastic processes;Transistors","SPICE;circuit reliability;stochastic processes;transistors","6-bit current-steering DAC;NBTI;deterministic reliability;device fabrics;equivalent transistor SPICE model;spatial stochastic;stochastic circuit reliability analysis;temporal stochastic;transistor aging","","7","","13","","","14-18 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though the controller has got 16 analogue to digital converter channels, it has no digital to analogue converters (DAC). This has led to the use of an external SPI serial MCP 4921 single channel DAC developed by microchip as well. The only currently available SIMULINK blocksets are developed for 16 or 32 bit PIC controllers. 16 bit PICs (DSPIC30xxx and DSPIC33xxx) were not used in this project because when implementing MATLAB fuzzy logic algorithm with a high number of rules (more than five rules), this requires larger stack memory which was not available on both chips.

OFDM achieves very efficient use of the allocated bandwidth and the main advantage is its robustness to frequency selectivity in wireless environment, like in the case of vehicular communications. The OFDM transceiver implementation presented in this paper is based on FPGA technology and the VHDL hardware description language. The hardware modules designed include QPSK modulator-demodulator, serial to parallel converter, FFT, IFFT. The use of reconfigurable FPGA devices and VHDL descriptions allowed a large number of tests to be carried out for each module, in order to obtain optimum results. The final implementation consists of two identical Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA development boards (one for the receiver and one for the transmitter), offering among others dual channel high performance ADCs and DACs, required for operation in the licensed ITS band of 5.9 GHz.","","978-1-61284-899-0","","10.1109/DTIS.2011.5941446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941446","Design Automation;Digital Integrated Circuits;IEEE 802.11 standards;OFDM;Reconfigurable Logic","Demodulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;OFDM;Phase shift keying;Software","OFDM modulation;bandwidth allocation;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;telecommunication channels;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless LAN","DAC;FPGA technologies;FPGA technology;IEEE 802.11a;IEEE 802.11p standard specifications;IFFT;OFDM system;OFDM transceiver;QPSK modulator-demodulator;VHDL descriptions;VHDL hardware description language;Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA development boards;bandwidth allocation;dual channel high performance ADC;licensed private operations over communication channels;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;public safety;receiver;reconfigurable FPGA devices;serial-to-parallel converter;transmitter;vehicular ad-hoc networks;vehicular communications;wireless environment","","1","","11","","","6-8 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An embedded process was set up in FPGA and would interpolate data from envelope when output of whole system is required to be typical reference. AGC circuits then standardize signal out of DACs to a constant peak-to-peak value, and VGA is obliged to fit the amplitude of signal as same as settings.

XML has become the de-facto standard for data representation and exchange on the World-Wide Web. This paper proposes a data integration method based on the XML technique in order to resolve the problem of data transmission for CAD and CAE. Designers parametrically model the bridges through 3D CAD platform. CAE analysts conduct explicit dynamic FEA (Finite Element Analysis) on the designed bridge structure. CAD and CAE functions are accomplished through C/S architecture. An XML and Web Service based DAC (Design-Analysis Connection) is developed to maintain a consistence between CAD model and FEA model. The design is then displayed to the customers through B/S mechanism, which provides a convenient method for the customers to participate the design process. Since all the operations are conducted through internet/intranet, customers, designers and analysts are able to participate the design process at different geographical locations. According to the interface procedure of the model transformation compiled in this paper, the finite element model was successfully transformed from CAD system to CAE system.","","978-1-4244-9717-1","","10.1109/ICCSE.2011.6028874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6028874","FEA;Integration of CAD and CAE;XML;model transformation","Bridges;Computer aided engineering;Design automation;Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays;Web services;XML","CAD;Web services;XML;computer aided engineering;finite element analysis","3D CAD platform;CAD model;CAD system;CAD/CAE data integration;CAE model;CAE system;FEA model;Web service;World Wide Web;XML;data integration method;data representation;design analysis connection;finite element analysis;finite element model;geographical location;geometric model;interface procedure;model transformation","","0","","18","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
