"Predictable design of low power systems by pre-implementation estimation and optimization","Nebel, W.","Oldenburg Univ., Germany","Design Automation Conference, 2004.

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","12","17","Each year tens of billions of Dollars are wasted by the microelectronics industry because of missed deadlines and delayed design projects. These delays are partially due to design iterations many of which could have been avoided if the low level ramifications of high level design decisions, at the architecture- and algorithmic-level would have been known before the time consuming and tedious RT- and lower level implementation started. In this contribution we present a system-level design flow and respective EDA support tools for low power designs. We analyze the requirements for such a design technology, which shifts more responsibility to the system architect. We exemplify this approach with a design flow for low power systems. The architecture of an algorithm-level power estimation tool is presented together with some use cases based on an EDA product which has been commercially developed from the research results of several collaborative projects funded by the Commission of the European Community.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337531","","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Design engineering;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Microelectronics;Power systems;Process design","circuit optimisation;electronic design automation;low-power electronics;systems analysis","algorithmic-level;architecture-level;design iteration;high level design decision;low power system design;microelectronics industry;optimization;power estimation tool;preimplementation estimation;system-level design flow","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a methodology is possible through implementing system-level behavioral models with different levels of abstraction that can be modelled or co-simulated at the IC circuit level. At module or board design, it is possible to link and simulate multiple chips with board-level components and parastics in an RFIC design environment. With today's more complex IC designs that are heading toward nanometer-scaled semiconductor processes, there is a desire to further understand the many subtle physical IC characteristics, such as layout and substrate parasitics, RF transistor models, IR drops, electromigration, elctromagnetics, and modelling of on-chip spiral inductors. Designers have entered into an era where they could benefit from a balance between analog, digital, and DSP design all in a fast and automated RFIC design environment. We present RF design methodologies that can bridge between system, IC, and module design, providing an efficient, thorough design flow using advanced EDA tools.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337625","","Circuit simulation;Design methodology;Electromigration;Integrated circuit layout;Integrated circuit modeling;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Semiconductor process modeling;Spirals;Substrates","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;radiofrequency integrated circuits;system-on-chip","EDA tools;IC circuit level;IR drops;RF design methodology;RF transistor models;electromagnetics;electromigration;nanometer-scaled semiconductor processes;on-chip spiral inductors;system-IC-module design;system-level behavior model","","0","3","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, producing high performance digital circuits in high yield becomes difIicult more and more. Various efforts have heeu done in order to analyze and reduce such fluctuations. Among them, statistical static timing analysis has been studied intensively in these days, which finds the distribution of the critical delay when the distribution of the delay of each element in a circuit is given. Such a statistical analysis takes probability into consideration, and is different from the conventional design style treating deterministic values only. Hence, it can he called a stochastic design style, which fits to the concept of the yield. This paper surveys the statistical static timing analysis tools, and considers the expectations of stochastic design. In the deep sub-micron technology, numerous collaborations between design and process will he needed in order to increase the yield and to shorten the time-to-market. Therefore, stochastic design style may open a new vista in the digital circuit design.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337696","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337696","","Circuit optimization;Delay;Digital circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Performance analysis;Probability;Stochastic processes;Timing;Uncertainty;Voltage","","","","4","1","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture is a method of running both the power and ground wires adjacent to the signal wires. This provides not only the general shielding effect but also explicit decoupling capacitance (decap) by means of the wires. Using this architecture also guarantees regularity, thus reducing manufacturing variations in interconnects. As a result of quantitative analysis performed using 90 nm technology node, we demonstrate that high-quality decap of over 50 nF in a 10 mm square chip can be obtained, the resistive IR-drop can be less than 20% of that of a conventional power grid, transient peak noise can be reduced by about 80%, and the inductive crosstalk effect of the signal wire can be greatly reduced.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337629","","Capacitance;Crosstalk;Manufacturing;Pareto analysis;Performance analysis;Robustness;Signal analysis;Signal design;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;interconnections;power electronics;system-on-chip","DEPOGIT;crosstalk effect;decoupling capacitance;dense power-ground interconnect architecture;physical design integrity;power-ground integrity;quantitative analysis;resistive IR-drop;signal wire;submicron VLSI design","","2","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the main contribution, we present the challenges in implementing an efticient communication architecture for on-chip diversity and outline a unified framework which addresses some of these issues. We then provide comparative experimental results and make a qualitative analysis of different architectural choices in the design of the on-chip communication.

This solves an open problem of designing an EXOR-tree based GRM network that admits a universal test set. For an n-variable function, the proposed design can be tested by (2n+8) test vectors, which are independent of the function and the circuit-under-test (CUT). Excepting a few intergate bridging faults in the EXOR-tree, it detects all other single bridging (both OR-and AND-type) and all single stuck-at faults. The EXOR-part is designed as a tree of depth (<span style=""font-family:Arial"" class=MsoNormal>┌</span>log<sub>2</sub>s<span style=""font-family:Arial"" class=MsoNormal>┐</span> +1), where s is the number of product terms in the given GRM expression.

The problem is NP-hard in general. To address this problem in the case of synchronous sequential digital designs, one needs to move some registers while applying voltage scaling. Moving these registers shifts some computational elements from critical paths, and can be done by basic retiming. Integrating basic retiming and voltage scaling to address this NP-hard problem cannot in general be done in polynomial run-time. We propose to first apply a guided retiming and then to apply supply voltage scaling on the retimed design. We devise new polynomial time algorithms to realize this guided retiming, and the supply voltage scaling on the retimed design. Experimental results on known benchmarks have shown that the proposed approach can reduce dynamic power consumption by factors as high as 61% for single-phase designs with minimal clock period. Also, they have shown that it can solve optimally the problem, and produce converter-free designs with reduced dynamic power consumption. For large size circuits from ISCAS'89 benchmark suite, the proposed algorithms run in 15s-1h.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337565","","Circuits;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Equations;Latches;Military computing;Power engineering computing;Registers;Switches","computational complexity;minimisation;power consumption;sequential circuits","NP-hard problem;combinational designs;computational elements;dynamic power consumption;polynomial time algorithms;single-phase designs;synchronous sequential digital designs;voltage scaling","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach to achieve this task is to embed the message in an innocent-looking cover-media. In our model. the message contents are scattered in the cover in a certain way that is based on a secret key known only to the sender and receiver. Therefore, even if the warden discovers the existence of the message, he will not be able to recover it. In other words a covert or subliminal communication channel is opened between two persons who possess a secret key to reassemble its contents. In this article, we propose a video or audio steganagraphic model in which the hidden message can be composed and inserted in the cover in real-time.

Wire capacitance presumed in logic synthesis typically contains excessive margin for better timing closure in layout design. Power waste due to this can be reduced by post-layout gate sizing based on information obtained by backannotation. Here, we discuss a theory of optimal gate sizing in a signal path with surplus timing. We also, propose a practical design methodology where standard cells are reselected from a cell library by the theory, replaced by engineering change order, and timing constraints are verified by a static timing analyzer. We have applied the methodology to a 700k-gate commercial application processor for 3G cellular phones. Even though the original design was optimized for 133MHz, 170mW operation in a 0.18μm CMOS technology, power dissipation was further squeezed by 15% in combinational logic without compromising the performance.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337614","","CMOS technology;Capacitance;Design engineering;Design methodology;Libraries;Logic design;Power engineering and energy;Signal synthesis;Timing;Wire","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit design;optimisation","3G cellular phone;700k-gate commercial application processor;backannotation;layout design;logic synthesis;optimal gate sizing;post-layout gate sizing;power reduction;wire capacitance","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, to achieve timing closure in DSM design, it is essential to consider the interconnect delay at an early stage of the synthesis process. Unfortunately, few successes of achieving a tight link of front-end synthesis to back-end layout have been reported, in a practical point of view, mainly due to the inaccuracy of predicting the layout effects during the synthesis. We address a new approach that refines the structure and placement of the circuit by iteratively performing the two tasks, timing-driven replacement and timing-driven resynthesis. The iterative mechanism of the two tasks practically tightly integrates the synthesis and placement tasks so that both of the effects of placement on the results of synthesis and the effects of synthesis on the results of placement are fully and effectively taken into account. From experiments using a set of benchmark designs, it is shown that the approach is quite effective, and efficient, producing designs with 6.6%-21.4% shorter timing over the conventional method.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337557","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337557","","Arithmetic;Birth disorders;Circuit synthesis;Delay;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit synthesis;Logic design;Timing;Wires","circuit layout;circuit optimisation;digital arithmetic;logic design;logic gates","DSM design;arithmetic circuits;back-end layout;benchmark design;front-end synthesis;integrated approach;iterative mechanism;logic gates;timing-driven replacement;timing-driven resynthesis;timing-driven synthesis","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","430","433","With the wide use of hard macros and IP blocks in design, buffered routing (simultaneous routing and buffer insertion) becomes unavoidable. Routing resource allocation and distribution are serious concerns in buffered routing of deep submicron design. The capability of capturing the tradeoff between routing resource cost and signal delay is crucial in practice since the resource overuse of min-delay solution may cause congestion problem (congestion also means over-inserting buffers). However, many existing algorithms are mainly designed to minimize signal delay. Here, we first study the problem of minimizing the linear combination of delay and cost, and extend the graph-based algorithm in [X. Tang et al., (2001)] to solve it. We then show that a variant of the algorithm can solve other problems such as maximizing delay reduction to cost ratio, minimizing routing cost subject to a delay constraint, and minimizing delay subject to the cost not exceeding a given budget. We also develop a hierarchical approach to buffered routing construction for problems with large number of sinks to tradeoff solution quality and runtime.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337613","","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Delay lines;Integrated circuit interconnections;Resource management;Routing;Runtime;Signal design;System-on-a-chip;Wire","buffer storage;circuit analysis computing;graph theory;minimisation;network routing;resource allocation","buffered routing;graph-based algorithm;routing resource allocation;routing resource cost;signal delay;submicron design","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design of the control logic of nonlinear pipelines has however, been considered as a subsidiary issue in that an RTL description for such logic can easily be obtained from a behavioral description, with the use of widely available synthesis tools. But, as the complexity of a nonlinear pipeline increases, so does the complexity of the control logic. The complexity may be to an extent that obtaining even a behavioral description for the control logic is rendered difficult. We focus on further automating the development of systems consisting of nonlinear or multifunction pipelines by proposing an algorithmic technique for obtaining a behavioral description for the control logic of such pipelines. A simplified C++ implementation that produces a VHDL description of the control logic is then presented to clarify the algorithm. Experimental results that reveal connections between the nature of pipeline functions and the complexity of the control logic, obtained by utilization of the algorithm, are also presented. Consideration of these results can reduce the design space exploration of such pipelines to a more practically feasible subspace.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337545","","Automatic control;Clocks;Combinational circuits;Control system synthesis;Delay;High level synthesis;Latches;Logic design;Pipelines;Space exploration","hardware description languages;logic design;pipeline processing","C++ implementation;RTL description;VHDL description;behavioral description;control logic;design space exploration;nonlinear pipelines","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But all these algorithms are slow and not scalable. We propose an algorithm, which is fast and scalable with problem size. The main idea of our approach is to specify some important high-level features of the whole routing tree so that it can be broken down into several components. We apply stochastic search to find the best specification. Since we need very few high-level features, the size of stochastic search space is small which can be searched in very less time. The solutions for the components are either pregenerated and stored in lookup tables, or generated by extremely fast algorithms whenever needed. Since it is efficient to obtain solutions for components, it is also efficient to construct and evaluate the whole routing tree for each specification. Experimental results show that, for trees of moderate size, our algorithm is at least several hundred times faster than the recently proposed algorithms. Experimental results also show that the trees generated by our algorithm have almost same delay and resource consumption as the trees generated by SP-tree.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337600","","Circuit optimization;Delay;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Modems;Routing;Stochastic processes;Topology;Wire;Wiring","VLSI;buffer circuits;circuit CAD;circuit analysis computing;circuit complexity;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","SP-tree;VLSI;buffer insertion;buffer obstacle;integrated circuit design;network topology;routing tree construction algorithm;stochastic search;wire sizing","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A strategy for research and development, as well as for product definition and marketing for electronic systems in view of the incoming nano era requires expertise and even excellence in so many diverse areas that even the largest semiconductor industry in the world, INTEL, cannot conceive it in isolation. The worldwide trend is to develop joint program between industry and academia with public and industrial funding sustained over a rather long time horizon to develop methods and technologies to master the difficult art of integrated system design. The central problem to be overcome is that traditional approaches to design and tools will not scale. Moreover, existing designers will not scale too because they do not have the required pluridisciplinary scale to deal with SoC. The strategic direction of EuroSoC is to address these issues by lining up the research community and by providing a framework where its collective knowledge can be fostered and fully leveraged by industry and society in general.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337532","","Art;Communication networks;Design methodology;Electronics industry;Electronics packaging;Isolation technology;Process design;Research and development;System-on-a-chip;Telecommunication network reliability","electronics industry;integrated circuit layout;research and development;system-on-chip","EuroSoC;industry research infrastructure;integrated system design;joint university infrastructure;semiconductor industry;system on chip","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","671","676","Congestion has been a topic of great importance in the floorplanning of deep-submicron Odesign. In this paper, we design an accurate and efficient congestion estimation model by performing global routing. We interpret the global routing problem as a flow problem of several commodities and relax the integral flow constraints. The objective of resulting fractional flow problem is to minimize the maximum congestion over all edges in the inner dual graph [ 131. The underlying routing graph for each commodity is derived by assigning directions to the inner dual graph edges. We design an efficient two-phase algorithm to solve this fractional flow problem. The first phase is denoted as Incoming Flow Balancing (IFB) by which a good initial solution is derived. The second phase is called Srepwise Flow Refinement (SFR) by which the maximum congestion of the solution in first phase is iteratively reduced to its optimal value. In addition, a valid global routing solution can be obtained by applying a simple rounding procedure on the fractional flow solution. The maximum congestion after rounding is only increased by 2.82% on average according to our experimental results. which justifies the use of fractional flow to estimate the routing congestion. Finally. we demonstrate our model by integrating it into a simulated annealing (SA) based floorplanner, where we use the maximum congestion as part of the cost of SA. The experimental results show that, on average, our congestion-driven floorplanner can generate a much less congested floorplan (-36.44%) with a slight sacrifice in area (+1.30%) and wirelength (+2.64%). The runtime of the whole SA process is only increased moderately (+270%).","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337677","","Costs;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Process design;Routing;Runtime;Shape;Simulated annealing;State estimation;Tiles","","","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The quality of placement is evaluated by a multiobjective according to an expert's guideline. We adopt a multistep simulated annealing to balance a tradeoff between the objectives.

We propose a methodology to estimate the circuit area in terms of gate count and maximum power-up current for any given logic function. We build novel estimation metrics based on logic synthesis and gate level analysis using only a small number of typical circuits, but no further logic synthesis and gate level analysis are needed during our estimation. Compared to time-consuming logic synthesis and gate level analysis, the average errors for circuits from a leading industrial design project are 23.59% for area and 21.44% for maximum power-up current.

If objects are rooms of a T-junction floorplan of n rooms and integers denote their Abe-orders, the ABLR-relations between rooms are coded to an SS by just reading the rooms in a dual way. We enhance the definition and the fact to the case when the floorplan consists of m(≥n) rooms and the ABLR-relations are defined on the focused n of these rooms. Coding, i.e. getting the minimum SS from a given floorplan and decoding, i.e. getting the minimum floorplan from a given SS such that focused n rooms satisfy the ABLR-relations defined through the SS-to-ABLR rule are fixed by linear time algorithms. The first application is in a core technique space-planning in physical design of large systems.

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","38","41","Nonrectangular (rectilinear) shape occurs very often in deep submicron floorplanning. Most previous algorithms are designed to handle only convex rectilinear blocks. However, handling concave rectilinear shape is necessary since a simple ""U"" shape is concave. A few works could address concave rectilinear block explicitly. In (K. Fujiyoshi, et al., (1999)), a necessary and sufficient condition of feasible sequence pair is proposed for arbitrary rectilinear shape in terms of constraint graph. However, no constraint is imposed on sequence pair representation itself. The search for feasible sequence pair mainly depends on the simulated annealing, which implies unnecessary inefficiency. In many cases, it takes very long time or even is unable to find the feasible placement. Furthermore, it takes O(n<sup>3</sup>) runtime to evaluate each sequence pair, which leaves much space for improvement. We propose a new method to handle arbitrary rectilinear shape constraint based on sequence pair representation. We explore the topological property of feasible sequence pair, and use it to eliminate lots of infeasible sequence pairs, which implies speeding up the convergence of simulated annealing process. The evaluation of a sequence pair is based on longest common subsequence computation, and achieves significantly faster runtime (O(mnloglogn) time where m is the number of rectilinear-shape constraints, n is the number of rectangular blocks/subblocks). The algorithm can handle fixed-frame floorplanning and min-area floorplanning as well.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337536","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Ear;Lakes;Runtime;Shape;Simulated annealing;Sufficient conditions;Topology;Very large scale integration","circuit layout CAD;computational complexity;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","arbitrary rectilinear shape constraint;concave rectilinear block;constraint graph;fixed-frame floorplanning;longest common subsequence computation;min-area floorplanning;sequence pair representation;simulated annealing;submicron floorplanning;topological property","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This means that the designer can explore several bus functional architectures before choosing the optimal one. However, the process of converting a transaction level model to a bus functional model is not trivial. A manual conversion would not only be time consuming but also error prone.

Our contributions are as follows. (1) We derive a closed-form approximation for the worst-case IR-drop on a single-level power mesh. The formula shows that for a given total routing area, the worst-case IR-drop increases logarithmically with the number of metal lines on the mesh.

Asia and South Pacific","20041004","2004","","","355","360","In order to achieve timing closure on increasingly complex IC designs, buffer insertion needs to be performed on thousands of nets within an integrated physical synthesis system. In most of previous works, buffers may be inserted at any open space. Even when there may appear to be space for buffers in the alleys between large blocks, these regions are often densely packed or may be useful later to fix critical paths. In addition, a buffer solution may inadvertently force wires to go through routing congested regions. Therefore, within physical synthesis, a buffer insertion scheme needs to be aware of both placement congestion and routing congestion of the existing layout and so it has to be able to decide when to insert buffers in dense regions to achieve critical performance improvement and when to utilize the sparser regions of the chip. With the proposed Steiner tree adjustment technique, this work aims at finding congestion-aware buffered Steiner trees. Our tree adjustment technique takes a Steiner tree as input, modifies the tree and simultaneously handles the objectives of timing, placement and routing congestion. To our knowledge, this is the first study, which simultaneously considers these three objectives for the buffered Steiner tree problem. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm while it achieves up to 20x speed-up when comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm (C.J.

This is accomplished by approximating each nodal voltage as a piecewise quadratic waveform, whose characteristics can be determined by matching the charge/discharge currents calculated by the capacitive components and the resistive components. Successive chord method is then applied to reduce the matrix construction and inversion overhead.

Conventionally, CTL semantics is defined over Kripke structure where each state is labelled with all the atomic propositions. For open systems, this necessitates input labeling of the states. In contrast, the common model, which is used for sequential circuit design, is the finite state machine (FSM) model, or equivalently, the state transition diagram (STD), where the inputs are associated not with the states but with the transitions. Thus, to use a conventional CTL model checker, the STD has to be converted first to the Kripke structure and then applying the model checking algorithm on the Kripke structure. The need for associating input labels to the states results in state explosion which finally tells upon the model checking efficiency. We present the CTL semantics over STD structures and develops a model checking algorithm which works directly over the STD. A performance gain over conventional model checking by an exponential factor results in the process, especially for open systems.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337610","","Automata;Bellows;Electronic mail;Explosions;Labeling;Logic;Open systems;Performance gain;Sequential circuits","computational complexity;computational linguistics;finite state machines;formal verification;logic testing;sequential circuits","CTL model checking;CTL semantic;Kripke structure;computation tree logic;finite state machine;open system;sequential circuit design;state transition diagram","","1","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is subject to typical constraints such as on-chip buffers should not overflow, and specified play out buffers (which feed audio or video devices) should not underflow, so that the quality of the audio/video output is maintained. The main difficulty in this problem arises from the high variability in execution times of stream processing algorithms, coupled with the bursty nature of the streams to be processed. We present a mathematical framework for such a rate analysis for streaming applications, and illustrate its feasibility through a detailed case study of a MPEG-2 decoder application. When integrated into a tool for automated design-space exploration, such an analysis can be used for fast performance evaluation of different stream processing architectures.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337553","","Buffer storage;Costs;Energy consumption;Feeds;Handheld computers;Mobile handsets;Network-on-a-chip;Streaming media;System-on-a-chip","buffer storage;performance evaluation;system-on-chip","MPEG-2 decoder application;audio-video output quality;automated design-space exploration;on-chip buffer constraints;performance evaluation;rate analysis;stream processing algorithm","","14","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the problem of design space exploration of lowenergy software bus encoding in embedded SoC design. Traditionally, finding a bus encoding that leads to a minimum energy consumption of bus has been an important research issue, but relatively little attention has been paid to the cost of software encoding implementation. In embedded system design, the memory space for storing the encoding information is strictly limited. Consequently, exploring the bus encoding implementation alternatives under such constraint becomes very necessary and/or useful. In this paper, we propose a systematic design space exploration algorithm for low-power bus encoding which completely eliminates the crosstalk delay. From experiments on a set of benchmark designs, the proposed algorithm was shown to consume 48% less power consumption on average over existing techniques with relatively little memory overhead.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337710","","Costs;Crosstalk;Delay;Embedded software;Encoding;Energy consumption;Information technology;Space exploration;Space technology;Wire","","","","2","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though formal methods can provide higher reliability, in practice often simulation based verification is used. Large testbenches are created and if the design produces the correct output for all stimuli it is said to be correct. But there is no guarantee that the testbench is complete in the sense that it contains test-cases for all ??important?? situations. We propose an approach to detect ??gaps?? in testbenches, i.e. behavior that is not tested. The approach relies on automatic generation of properties from the testbench in terms of a formal property language. By construction the properties are valid within the testbench. A model checker proves the validity of the property on the design. If this proof succeeds, the testbench covers all possible situations for given signals. In case of failure counter-examples are produced. These counter-examples represent behavior that is not tested, i.e. a gap in the testhench.

Buffer insertion is one of the most effective and popular techniques to reduce interconnnect delay and decouple coupling effects. It is traditionally applied to post-layout optimization. However, it is obviously infeasible to insert hundreds of thousands buffers during the post-layout starge when most routing regions are occupied. Therefore, it is desirable to incorporate buffer planning into floor-planning to ensure thiming closure and design convergence. In this paper, we drive the formulae of feasible regions, and integrate buffer planning with floor-planning to optimize area, timing, noise, and congestion (routability) simultaneously. In particular, we treat each buffer block as a soft module and apply Lagragian relaxation to optimize the floorplan area. Experimental results show that our method obtains an average suceess rate of 94.9% (86.4%) of nets meeting timimg constraint alone (both timing and noise constraints)and consumes an average extra area of only 0.1% (0.2%) over the given floorplan.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337667","","Capacitance;Circuit noise;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Integrated circuit interconnections;Noise figure;Routing;Timing;Wire","","","","2","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an energy efficient code generation technique for rISA architectures, and furthermore explore energy savings for both cached and noncached architectures. Our code generation technique uses profile information to find the most frequently executed parts of the program. By aggressively reducing code size on frequently executed parts, fewer fetches to instruction memory are incurred, thus reducing the power consumption of the instruction memory.

We first define the simplified RC circuit model of a hybrid clock mesh/tree structure. The skew reduction effect of shunt segment contributed by the mesh is derived analytically from the simplified model. The result indicates that the skew decreases proportionally to the exponential of -R<sub>1</sub>/R, where R<sub>1</sub> is the driving resistance of a leaf node in the clock tree and R is the resistance of a mesh segment. Based on our analysis, we propose a hybrid multilevel mesh and tree structure for global clock distribution. A simple optimization scheme is adopted to optimize the routing resource distribution of the multilevel mesh. Experimental results show that by adding a mesh to the bottom-level leaves of an H-tree, the clock skew can be reduced from 29.2 ps to 8.7 ps, and the multilevel networks with same total routing area can further reduce the clock skew by another 30%. We also discuss the inductive effect of mesh in the appendix. When the clock frequency is less than 4 GHz, our RC model remains valid for clock meshes with grounded shielding or using differential signals.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337577","","Circuits;Clocks;Computer science;Delay;Frequency;Microprocessors;Minimization;Registers;Routing;Tree data structures","RC circuits;clocks;minimisation","RC circuit model;clock skew minimization;hybrid clock mesh structure;leaf node;multilevel clock distribution network;optimization scheme;routing resource distribution;tree structure","","13","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This eliminates the intermediate CNF variable for the output of the first gate, and reduces the number of CNF clauses, compared to the conventional translation to CNF, where each gate is assigned an output variable and is represented with a separate set of CNF clauses. Chains of nested ITE operators, where each ITE is used only as else-argument of the next ITE, are similarly merged and represented with a single set of clauses without intermediate variables. This method was applied to Boolean formulas from formal verification of microprocessors. The formulas require up to hundreds of thousands of variables and millions of clauses, when translated to CNF with the conventional approach. The best translation reduced the CNF variables by up to 2× the SAT-solver decisions by up to 5× the SAT-solver conflicts by up to 6× and accelerated the SAT checking by up to 7.6× for unsatisfiable formulas, and 136× for satisfiable ones.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337587","","Business continuity;Computer bugs;Cost function;Decision feedback equalizers;Formal verification;Logic gates;Merging;Microprocessors;NP-complete problem","Boolean functions;formal verification;logic CAD;logic gates;microprocessor chips","Boolean formulas;SAT-solver;equivalent CNF clauses;formal verification;nested ITE operators","","19","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parameter model order reduction is motivated by such practical problems. The purpose is to obtain a parametric reduced order model so that repeated reduction can be avoided. In this paper we propose two techniques: a nominal projection technique and an interpolation technique. The nominal projection technique is effective for small parameter perturbation by using a robust projection. The interpolation technique takes the advantage of simple matrix structure resulting from the PVL algorithm. A new moment matching concept in the discrete-time domain is also introduced, which is intended for a better performance in waveform matching and stability. Interconnect examples are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337699","","Frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Interpolation;Parametric statistics;RLC circuits;Reduced order systems;Robust stability;Solid modeling;Very large scale integration;Wire","","","","3","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Beside the irregular DSP architectures for reducing chip size and energy consumption, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) functionality is frequently integrated with the intention of performance improvement. In order to get an energy-efficient system consisting of processor and compiler, it is necessary to optimize hardware as well as software. It is not obvious that SIMD operations can save any energy: if n operations are executed in parallel, each of them might consume the same amount of energy as if there were executed sequentially. Up to now, no work has been done to investigate the influence of compiler generated code containing SIMD operations w.r.t. the energy consumption. This paper deals with the exploration of the energy saving potential of SIMD operations for a DSP by using a generic compilation framework including an integrated instruction level energy cost model for our target architecture. Effects of SIMD operations on the energy consumption are shown for several benchmarks and an MP3 application'.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337711","","Computer architecture;Costs;Digital signal processing;Digital signal processing chips;Digital signal processors;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Program processors","","","","2","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The output at the saturation region increases 30 times larger than the orignial one.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337656","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Crosstalk;Frequency;Gray-scale;Image sensors;Intensity modulation;Optical modulation;Phase modulation;Sensor phenomena and characterization","","","","0","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider pre-routing capacitance estimation for FPGAs and develop an empirical estimation model, suitable for use in power-aware placement, early power prediction, and other applications. We show that estimation accuracy is improved by considering aspects of the FPGA interconnect architecture in addition to generic parameters, such as net fanout and bounding box perimeter length. We also show that there is an inherent variability (noise) in the capacitance of nets routed using a commercial FPGA layout tool. This variability limits the accuracy attainable in capacitance estimation.

We study the power control strategy based on different orderings for the SIC given the knowledge of the battery capacity of the mobiles. In particular we propose different ordering schemes for SIC for different optimization objectives such as minimizing the total power, maximizing the minimum transmission/connection time for a group of users within the same cell and maximizing the total amount of data transmitted for a group of users.

We propose the architectural level enhancements to facilitate the incorporation of the DFC in wide issue superscalar processors for an energy efficient memory hierarchy. Extensive simulations on the modified superscalar architecture shows that the use of the (predictor based) DFC results in an average reduction of 17.33% and 25.09% fetch energy reduction in LI cache along with 37.2% and 46.6% reduction in number of decodes for 64 and 128 instruction DFC respectively.

We build on this ohservation and introduce the notion of ""invalid states"" that might arise due to forward moves. We show that the set of synchronizing sequences of a given circuit can he preserved by modifying transitions from those invalid states.

There are often multiple longest paths for each fault site in the circuit, due to different process conditions. To detect the smallest delay fault, it is necessary to test all longest paths through the fault site. However, previous methods are either inefficient or their results include too many paths that are not longest. We present an efficient method to generate the longest path set for delay test under process variation. To capture both structural and systematic process correlation, we use linear delay functions to express path delays under process variation. A novel path-pruning technique is proposed to discard paths that are not longest, resulting in a significantly reduction in the number of paths compared with the previous best method. The new method can be applied to any process variation as long as its impact on delay is linear.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337547","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Delay effects;Delay lines;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Manufacturing processes;Performance evaluation;Propagation delay;Table lookup","combinational circuits;delays;fault diagnosis","delay test;fault site;linear delay functions;longest path selection;manufacturing process variation;path-pruning technique;structural process correlation;systematic process correlation","","14","2","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation time for a BDD can he crucial and is measured by the expected path length of the BDD. In this paper a new technique for BDD minimization with respect to the expected path length is suggested to reduce evaluation time. It is based on sifling and, unlike previous approaches, performs variable swaps with the same time complexity as the original sifting algorithm. Another field of application for BDDs is logic synthesis, often targeting Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) because of low power and low cost. A minimization of BDD size and chip area can lead to poor timing performances. We suggest to also use our method here, as the resulting BDDs show a very low maximal and average path delay. This supports the synthesis of high-speed PTL circuits at low area overhead. Experimental results are given to show the efficiency of our approach.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337716","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Circuits;Costs;Data structures;Delay;Logic;Minimization;Page description languages;Timing","","","","6","1","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using a table look-up and a tree-based hreadthfirst search strategy, our method quickly computes NPR for a given function. Boolean matching of the given function against the whole library is determined by checking the presence of its NPR in a hash table, which stores NPRs for all the library functions and their complements. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental results, which shows that it is more than two orders of magnitude faster than the Hinsherger-Kolla's algorithm-the fastest Boolean matching algorithm for large libraries.","","0-7803-8175-0","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2004.1337660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337660","","Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Costs;Libraries;Logic circuits;Sufficient conditions","","","","5","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several modem huffer insertion algorithms (e.g.. 17.6.151) are based on van Ginneken??s dynamic programming paradigm [141. However, van Ginneken??s original algorithm does not control buffering resources and tends to over-buffering, thereby wasting area and power. It has been a major open prohlem whether it is possible to optimize slack and at the same time minimize the buffer usage. This paper settles this open problem by showing that for arbitrary integer cost functions, the problem is NP-complete. We also extend the prr-buffer slack technique (121 to minimize the buffer cost. This technique can significantly reduce the running time and memory in buffer cost miniminition problem. The experimental results show that our algorithm can speed up the running time up to 17 times and reduces the memory to 1/30 of traditional best know algorithm.

The fault effect grouping criteria are identified based on a module structure analysis, improving the propagation ability of the diagnostic information through RT modules.

Even though there exist efficient heuristics, their performance cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we develop a dummy fill algorithm that is both efficient and with provably good performance.

Our approach reduces the overall traffic produced to collect the current state of the system (monitoring-traffic), needed for runtime mapping, compared to a centralized mapping scheme. In our experiment, we obtain 10.7 times lower monitoring traffic compared to the centralized mapping scheme proposed in [8] for a 64 times 64 NoC. Our proposed scheme also requires less execution cycles compared to a non-clustered centralized approach.

So we propose a faster counterexample minimization algorithm based on refutation analysis and incremental SAT. First, for every UNSAT instance of BFL, we perform refutation analysis to extract the set of variables that lead to UNSAT, all variables not belong to this set can be eliminated simultaneously. In this way, we can eliminate many variables with only one call to SAT solver. At the same time, we employ incremental SAT approach to share learned clauses between similar instances of BFL, to prevent overlapped state space from being searched repeatedly. Theoretic analysis and experiment result shows that, our approach can be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than BFL, and still retain the minimization ability of BFL (Ravi and Somenzi, 2004).","","0-7803-8736-8","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2005.1466205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1466205","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Data mining;Hardware;Minimization methods;Performance analysis;Production systems;Software systems;Space technology;State-space methods","computability;minimisation of switching nets","BFL algorithm;SAT solver;UNSAT;bounded model checking;brute force lifting;counterexample minimization;incremental SAT;refutation analysis","","3","","8","","","18-21 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work develops a bitwidth-aware synthesis flow, including bitwidth analysis, scheduling and binding, and register allocation and binding, to exploit the multi-bitwidth nature of operations and variables for area-efficient designs.
