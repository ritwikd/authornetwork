The three-dimensional (3D) micropumps consist of stacks of structured PMMA layers, which are either realised with precision milling tools for the more complex parts, or fabricated using the powder blasting technique for channel-type structures. We integrate silicone membranes into the chip to realize check-valves or use dynamic diffuser valves. We use two different types of magnetic actuation external to the micropump: (i) an external magnet displaces a ferrofluid liquid plug that plays the role of a piston in a channel; (ii) an external coil actuates an integrated magnetic membrane, consisting of NdFeB magnetic powder in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290621","","Biomembranes;Magnetic liquids;Micropumps;Milling;Pistons;Plastics;Plugs;Powders;Prototypes;Valves","boron alloys;ferroelectric materials;iron alloys;magnetic fluids;magnetic particles;microactuators;micropumps;microvalves;neodymium alloys;plastics;polymers;powder technology;silicones","NdFeB;NdFeB magnetic powder;channel type structures;check valves;dynamic diffuser valves;ferrofluid membrane actuation;magnetic actuation;magnetic membrane actuation;plastic micropumps;polydimethylsiloxane matrix;polymethylmethacrylate;powder blasting technique;precision milling tools;prototyping technology;silicone membranes","","0","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The chromium acted in a self-aligned fashion to block light from the non-lens portion of the substrate, and the lenses acted to shape the beam through the epoxy to produce sharply-tapered structures. An extension of the technique allows for subsequent repetition of the structure through micromolding; solid biodegradable microneedles with a cone shape were fabricated in this manner.

Thus, large switching areas are possible without decreased RF isolation. Furthermore, the design provides with active-opening capability making it less susceptible for stiction and self-actuation mechanisms. The switch is fabricated on two different substrates and finally assembled, leading to a near hermetic package integrated switch.

A well-defined adhesion between the PDMS film, the mold, the transfer substrate and the target wafer is key to each successful transfer, and plays a crucial role in the efficient removal of nanometer-thick residual membranes that systematically obstruct vias formed by embossing.

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating.

In this method, the difference between the thermal conductivities of air and water vapor at high temperatures is used. Humidity sensing idea is to compare the output voltages of two heated and thermally isolated diodes one of which is exposed to the environment and has a humidity dependent thermal conductance while the other is sealed and has a fixed thermal conductance. Thermal isolation is obtained by a simple front-end bulk silicon etching process in a TMAH solution, while the diodes are protected by electrochemical etch-stop technique. Electrical connections to the suspended diodes are obtained with polysilicon interconnect layers in order to increase the thermal resistance so that the diodes are heated to the desired temperature levels with less power. Due to the high electrical resistance of the polysilicon, temperature sensitivities of the diodes reduced to -1.3 mV/K at 100 Î¼A bias level. The diodes are connected to the readout circuit monolithically using the standard CMOS fabrication. Characterization results show that the humidity sensitivity of the sensor is 14.3 mV/%RH, 26 mV/%RH, and 46.9 mV/%RH for 20Â°C, 30Â°C, and 40Â°C, respectively, with a nonlinearity less than 0.3%.

Contacts are found to soften and self-anneal at a temperature of about 100Â°C, corresponding to a contact voltage of about 80 mV. Larger contact force induces a larger decrease in contact resistance during softening, suppressing contact heating.

A self-supported double polyimide layer is used as the main platform providing mechanical strength, electrical insulation, and flexibility. The packaged devices can be folded and twisted to make any desired shape and form required for various applications. In this paper, we will describe our initial efforts using the silicon mold followed by conversion to a PDMS mold having several advantages such as: 1) wider tolerance range for device placement and insertion, 2) easier release, and 3) lower manufacturing costs. A two-step polyimide curing process is developed to accommodate the low-temperature requirements of the PDMS mold. Initial polyimide curing at <140Â°C is followed by the release of the packaged devices which are then hard-baked at higher temperatures to fully cure the polyimide. The polyimide-PDMS integration process can be beneficial to several other polyimide-based technologies such as flexible recording and stimulating electrodes.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290681","","Assembly;Costs;Curing;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Packaging;Polyimides;Pulp manufacturing;Shape;Silicon;Transducers","curing;elemental semiconductors;insulation;integrated circuit packaging;mechanical strength;micromechanical devices;moulding;polymer films;silicon","ICs;PDMS;carry chips;device tolerance;electrical insulation;foldable multichip packaging technique;integrated circuits;manufacturing costs;mechanical strength;micromachined transducers;polyimide curing process;polyimide platform;silicon chips","","1","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the case of the deep trench, the liquid photoresist is not or very thinly coated at edge parts of the trench boundary. And, if a very thick resist coated, it is nearly impossible to develop the photoresist in the deep trench. To solve these problems, it is capped by laminating negative DFR(dry film resist) film on the cavity opening of the deep trench. Then positive photoresist is conventionally coated and patterned by the same photomask for the deep trench. To apply electric signals from outside to inside of the trench, aluminum on sidewall and bottom of the deep trench was successfully patterned by newly developed lithography method.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290677","","Aluminum;Electromagnetic scattering;Fabrication;Lithography;Microstructure;Particle scattering;Resists;Silicon;Testing;Vehicles","aluminium;masks;micromechanical devices;photoresists","Al;MEMS;aluminum;dry film resist;extreme deep trench;laminated negative dry film resist;liquid photoresist;lithography process;microelectro mechanical system;photomask;trench boundary","","0","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high compliance accommodates significant variations in the sample surface, and also prevents damage to soft samples. In addition, since integrated actuators and accompanying circuitry are no longer required, the prospect of scaling to large numbers of probes for high speed, high resolution thermal mapping of large areas with simple detection circuitry is enhanced. Based on single probes fabricated in the same process, the estimated spatial resolution, thermal conductance resolution, and temperature resolution are 50 nm, 11 pW/K, and 1.2 mK respectively. Scalability and performance of the 8-probe prototype are evaluated, addressing issues of speed vs. resolution, thermal and mechanical decoupling.

TiN films having the thickness between 1.5 Î¼m and 2.0 Î¼m were deposited onto 9 Î¼m or 24 Î¼m-thick single crystal silicon (SCS) specimen by rf reactive magnetron sputtering.

The fluidic DAC, composed of binary-weighted flow resistance, is designed to control the flow-rate based on the ratio of the flow resistance to achieve finer flow-rate levels. The binary-weighted flow resistance has been specified by a serial or a parallel connection of an identical flow resistor to improve the linearity of the flow-rate control by making the flow-resistance ratio insensitive to the size errors in flow resistors due to micromachining errors. We have designed and fabricated three types of 4-digit DMFC: Prototype S and P with serial and the parallel combinations of an identical flow resistor and Prototype V with width-varied flow resistors. In the experimental study, we perform static DMFC tests at forward and backward flow conditions as well as dynamic DMFC tests at pulsating flow conditions. The present DMFC shows the nonlinearity of 5.0% and finer flow-rate levels of 16(2<sup>N</sup>) for 4(N) digital valves. From the measured flow-rate deviation due to micromachining errors, Prototypes S and P shows 27.2% and 27.6% of the deviation measured from Prototype V, respectively; thus verifying that Prototypes S and P are less sensitive to the micromachining error than Prototype V.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290578","","Control systems;Digital control;Digital-analog conversion;Fluid flow control;Fluidic microsystems;Immune system;Microfluidics;Micromachining;Prototypes;Resistors","digital control;digital-analogue conversion;flow control;microfluidics;micromachining","binary weighted flow resistor network;biomedical dosing systems;digital microflow controllers;flow resistance;flow resistors;flowrate control;fluidic digital to analog converters;micromachining errors;parallel connection;serial connection","","0","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The TE generator is composed of a thermoelectric (TE) module, a catalytic combustor, an ejector to supply air to the combustor and an ignition heater. Liquid gases such as butane and propane are used as fuel. The ejector makes supersonic fuel jet from a Laval nozzle, and sucks air by viscous dragging and pressure drop due to the fuel jet. The prototyped ejector sucked air with 31.2 times larger volume of air, satisfying the requirements for the complete combustion of butane. However, the performance dramatically decreases with increase in back pressure. Therefore, to minimize the pressure loss of the combustor is necessary. The combustor without a load (TE module) achieved self-sustaining combustion and electrical ignition using butane as fuel. When the TE modules were attached to the combustor, however, butane combustion was impossible and the combustion efficiency of hydrogen decreased. The generation test was performed by attaching two TE modules to the combustor and using hydrogen as fuel. The conversion efficiency reached 1.8% at an output power of 276 mW. This study confirmed that the miniature TE generator is practical, if the performance of the combustor is improved.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290586","","Combustion;Fuels;Gases;Hydrogen;Ignition;Performance evaluation;Prototypes;Tellurium;Testing;Thermoelectricity","combustion;electric ignition;jets;microfluidics;nozzles;organic compounds;supersonic flow;thermoelectric conversion","276 mW;Laval nozzle;butane;catalytic butane combustor;catalytic combustion;combustion efficiency;ejector;electrical ignition;electrical power source;generation test;high energy density power source;hydrogen;ignition heater;liquid gases;pressure drop;pressure loss minimization;propane;selfsustaining combustion;supersonic fuel jet;thermal power source;thermoelectric generator","","1","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gyroscope uses vertically offset combs to resonate the proof mass in the vertical plane, and lateral combs to sense the Coriolis force in the horizontal plane. The extended SBM process is a simple two-mask process, and because all structural parts and combs are defined in one mask level, there is no misalignment in any structural parts or comb fingers. Furthermore, all vertical dimensions of the structure, including the comb height, comb offset and sacrificial gap, can be defined arbitrarily. In addition, the inherent footing phenomenon in the SOI deep etching is completely eliminated and smooth structural shapes are obtained. The fabricated x-axis gyroscope can resolve 0.1 deg/sec angular rate, and the measured bandwidth is 100 Hz. The reported work represents the first x-axis single-crystalline silicon gyroscope fabricated using only one wafer without wafer bonding.

Fluorinert is a type of fluorine compound produced by 3 M. When a drop of silicone oil was poured on a Fluorinert layer, spontaneous convection was observed. Driving force of this flow is considered to be the distribution of surface tension. Thermo-capillary convection or solute-capillary convection was noted, however this new type of convection is considered depending on evaporation. As well known, for micro-scale phenomena, wetting and surface tension are dominant. These two forces are also dominant under microgravity conditions, and thus when we carry out microgravity experiments we are aware of their presence. This new capillary convection was discovered during the preparation of microgravity experiments. The driving force point seemed to be at the liquid-liquid-gas triple meeting point. The fact that this driving force does not need any mechanical system leads to the possibility to build very small actuators. Promising application area of this method is not only the development of micro-actuators but also the handling of fluids in space.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290629","","Actuators;Bridges;Gravity;Mechanical systems;Microactuators;Petroleum;Plastics;Silicon;Space technology;Surface tension","capillarity;convection;fluorine compounds;microactuators;microfluidics;silicones;surface tension;wetting;zero gravity experiments","capillary force;evaporation;fluorine compound;fluorinert;immiscible liquid;liquid-liquid-gas triple meeting point;microactuator;microfluidics;microgravity experiments;silicone oil;solute-capillary convection;space fluids;surface tension;thermo-capillary convection;wetting","","0","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Phase change during the boiling process was studied under forced convection conditions, where DI water was used as the working fluid. No boiling plateau, associated with latent heat, has been observed in the boiling curves of microchannel heat sinks. Flow visualization was carried out to understand the boiling mechanism in such a system. Three phase-change modes were observed depending on the input power level. Local nucleation boiling within the microchannels occurred at low power level. At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system.

The linearity is determined in a two-tone experiment in which two sinusoidal signals are applied to the device. The measurement is done on a series capacitor because it has a lower dynamic range requirement for the spectrum analyzer and the measurements can be done at a lower frequency than for the shunt configuration. However, at high frequency difference, the linearity becomes so high that it is difficult to measure due to the limitations of the measurement equipment.

The theoretical comb-width profile was derived to obtain a constant electrostatic stiffness, independent of the position of the combs. A tunable microactuator, having 186 pairs of the varied comb-width profile, was designed and fabricated by the standard surface micromachining process. Under a biased voltage of 150 V, the resonant frequency was tuned and reduced by 55% from the initial resonant frequency of 19 kHz and the corresponding effective stiffness was decreased 80% from the initial value of 2.64 N/m. As such, this scheme can be applied to comb-shape, electrostatic-based microsensors and microactuators for active frequency tuning applications.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290571","","Displacement control;Electrostatics;Fingers;Microactuators;Microstructure;Resonant frequency;Shape;Space stations;Tuning;Voltage control","electric fields;microactuators;micromachining;microsensors;tuning","150 V;19 kHz;electrostatic postfabrication frequency tuning;electrostatic stiffness;frequency tunable microactuator;microactuators;microsensors;resonant frequency;surface micromachining process;varied comb width profile","","1","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thermal drift analysis, and design optimization to minimize the thermal drift of sensitivity and offset voltage is performed with FEM analysis. Experimental results agreed well with these theoretical results. When the temperature of newly fabricated device base on thermal drift analysis is controlled at 300Â°C with temperature control system, an offset voltage drift increased a little as compared to offset voltage drift when temperature is not controlled.

The new process is based on generating a thin surface layer with a lowered glass transition temperature in a thicker polymer bulk layer with a higher glass transition temperature by near-surface degradation of the thermoplastic polymer. So welding or heat-sealing is possible at low temperatures. Because of the low thermal load, even bulk structures in the range of some few micrometers and with structure details in the submicron range remain dimensionally stable. The new bonding strategy is demonstrated using the example of a process on the basis of photodegradation.

The developed switch element is a relatively wide and thick cantilever having two contacts and should have a contact force of 70 Î¼N per each contact at an applied voltage of 60 V based on the simulation.

Experimental results support the design introduced in this paper.","","0-7803-8265-X","","10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290565","","Analytical models;Finite element methods;Fluid flow;Microvalves;Optimal control;Optimization methods;Performance analysis;Pressure control;Solid modeling;Valves","computational fluid dynamics;finite element analysis;flow control;flow simulation;microactuators;microfluidics;microvalves;nozzles","actuator;circular nozzles;computational fluid dynamics;finite element simulation;gas flow control;multiple orifice arrangement;optimal gas flow capacity;optimal nozzle design;seat microvalve nozzle;stroke length","","0","","","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves.

Pumping is controlled galvanostatically (i.e., through electrolysis current). At low back pressures, pumping rate can reach 200 nL/min using just 40 Î¼A (power consumption <100 Î¼W). At 80 psi, 200 Î¼A (power consumption <1 mW) is sufficient to deliver fluid at 75 nL/min. Higher electrical currents have been used to increase the flow rate or to achieve pumping at higher back pressures.

The slow response agrees well with that of the rotating micro-actuators fabricated in this work. On the other hand, based on heat transfer analyses, a theoretical response time of the order of a few milli-seconds should be possible for scaled microactuators, thus implying a frequency performance of at least a few hundred Hz. Therefore it is concluded that the response of SMA micro-actuators may not be limited by heat transfer, but by the slow rate of phase transformation between the austenitic and the martensitic phases. This is consistent with the slow phase growth rate of about 0.3 Î¼m/s observed using in-situ transmission electron microscopy","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838545","","Actuators;Cooling;Electrostatics;Frequency response;Heat transfer;Microactuators;Resistance heating;Shape memory alloys;Temperature;Transistors","frequency response;microactuators;nickel alloys;shape memory effects;titanium alloys;transmission electron microscopy","TiNi;austenitic phase;frequency response;heat transfer analyses;in-situ transmission electron microscopy;martensitic phase;phase transformation;response time;rotating micro-actuators;shape memory alloy;thin film micro-actuators","","1","","9","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedding transducers, as predicted by technology roadmaps, is yet another step in this continuous search for higher levels of integration and miniaturisation. Embedded transducers fabricated with silicon/CMOS compatible technologies may have more limitations than transducers fabricated with fully dedicated technologies. However, they offer industry the possibility of providing low cost applications for very large market niches, while still keeping acceptable transducer sensitivity. This is the case, for example, for accelerometers, micro-mirrors display devices or CMOS imagers. Embedded transducers are analog components. However, given the fact that they work with signals other than electrical, the test of these embedded parts poses new challenges. Test technology for SoC devices is rapidly maturing but many difficulties still remain, in particular for addressing the test of analog and mixed-signal parts.

A micromachining process flow, combining anodic bonding and single crystal silicon etching with heavy boron doping, was developed to fabricate the movable Si-based microbridges over a coplanar waveguide (CPW). An electrostatic voltage, applied between the Si layer of the microbridges (varactors) and CPW ground plane, pulls down the microbridges, effecting a phase shift varying linearly with. frequency.

The joining of two wafers is required to protect surfaced micromachined structures during fabrication and use. The object of this paper is to investigate numerically the influence of the bonding process on the generated residual stress in the glass frit layer of a typical chip. The residual stresses are caused by different coefficients of thermal expansion of the frit glass and the silicon wafer. A determination of the stress level is required, since the residual stress can influence the properties of the capped micro-machined structures and also the long-term reliability of the bond frame. A parameterized finite element (FE) model of a typical chip structure was developed which consists of a silicon device wafer, the glass frit layer and a silicon cap wafer with a cavity. Frame width and thickness of the glass, also called seal glass, were varied. It was shown that significant stresses (about 100 MPa) occur in the plane of seal glass because of cooling after bonding. The influence of bond pressure is rather small. The residual stresses have be to considered if further mechanical stresses are investigated. So a tension test normal to the seal glass plane was superposed with the residual stresses. The location of maximum stresses could be shown and it was in agreement with experimental results.","","0-7803-8420-2","","10.1109/ESIME.2004.1304071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304071","","Finite element methods;Glass;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Packaging;Residual stresses;Seals;Silicon;Thermal stresses;Wafer bonding","finite element analysis;internal stresses;micromachining;micromechanical devices;sealing materials;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;stress analysis;tensile testing;thermal expansion;wafer bonding","MEMS fabrication;Si;bond pressure;bonding process generated residual stress;capped micro-machined structures;chip structure;cooling;finite element analysis;glass frit bonded MEMS;glass frit bonding technique;intermediate glass layer;long-term bond frame reliability;maximum stress location;mechanical stresses;micro-electro-mechanical systems packaging;parameterized finite element model;residual stress;seal glass;silicon cap wafer cavity;silicon device wafer;silicon wafer;surfaced micromachined structures;tension test;thermal expansion coefficients;wafer joining","","6","","8","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MEMS have been extensively used as micro-scale high-quality oscillators, communication resonators, microphones, amplifiers and other micro-oscillators. In this investigation, mathematical model of a micro-mechanical resonator is developed subject to a full nonlinear model. The governing equation is a nonlinear parametric and hence, the stability of the system depends on the value of its parameters. The output signal of MEMS is not reliable when it is operating in a saturated or in an instable region. From a design viewpoint, a stability chart is needed to indicate the relationship between the parameters to determine when the system is stable, periodic, or unstable.

The ban of lead has caused a switch to lead-free solders rather than to isotropically conductive adhesives (ICAs), even if the latter posses many valuable qualities. The reason from manufacturing perspective is the minimum amount of changes in equipments and processes. ICAs have also reliability concerns since they have less resistance against loads from damp heat and impact stresses than tin-lead or lead-free solders. However, the future phone or accessory functionalities may require the use of MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors). With MEMS some ICA advantages over solders become important.

In this study, we first review existing roughness models described by stochastic processes of Gaussian and Fractal type. Then, the vdW force is formulated using two methods by considering the first and second order probability density function (pdf) of the height distribution of rough surfaces. The resulting formulae are functions of the correlation ( Ã±) between successive sampling points. By analyzing these formulae based on the correlation and other parameters, the upper and lower bound of vdW force are identified and a numericalbased closed-form formula for the upper bound is derived. Finally, various situations are discussed based on the developed equations and data from a surface micro machining process.","","0-7695-2189-4","","10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1509026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509026","","Electrostatics;Fractals;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Probability density function;Rough surfaces;Sampling methods;Stochastic processes;Surface roughness;Upper bound","","","","0","","16","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most present actuators require orders of magnitude more power than is presently available from micropower sources. To enable smaller microrobots, this research investigated a simplified power concept that eliminates the need for on-board power supplies and control circuitry by using actuators powered wirelessly from the environment. The use of lasers to directly power micrometer scale silicon thermal actuators was explored. Optothermal actuators, intended for use on a small wirelessly propelled autonomous MEMS microrobot, were modeled, designed, fabricated and tested, using the PolyMUMPs silicon-metal chip fabrication process. A 760 Âµm by 710 Âµm prototype MEMS polysilicon-based microrobot, using optothermal actuators, was designed, fabricated and tested. Each of its parts was demonstrated to provide actuation using energy from an external laser. The optothermal actuators provided 2 Âµm of deflection to the microrobot drive shaft, with 60 mW of pulsed laser power. The results of these experiments demonstrated the validity of a new class of wireless polysilicon actuators for MEMS devices, which are not directly dependant on electrical power for actuation. The experiments also demonstrated a potentially viable design that could be used to propel the worldÂs smallest autonomous MEMS microrobot.","","0-7695-2189-4","","10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1508992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508992","","Actuators;Engines;Laser modes;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Power generation;Power lasers;Power system modeling;Propulsion;Testing","","","","2","5","10","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By combined use of an ODV (omnidirectional vision) with a hemispherical forward-visual-field using a direct and reflection hybrid optical system, a RTK-GPS (real time kinematics-global positioning system) and a MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) IMU (inertial measurement unit), this sensor outputs a realtime image for remote control of a mobile robot and a panoramic integration map, including information on three-dimensional own-position, with a continuous panoramic image for searching victims and for making a rescue plan. The evaluation of the panoramic integration map and the Kalman filter based self-positioning reveals that the proposed method is valid and effective","","0-7803-8614-8","","10.1109/ROBIO.2004.1521755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521755","Environmental Recognition;Inertial Measurement Unit;Map Generation;Micro Electro Mechanical Systems;Mobile Robot;Omnidirectional Vision;Panoramic Image;Real Time Kinematics-Global Positioning System;Sensor","Integrated optics;Measurement units;Mechanical sensors;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Navigation;Optical filters;Optical reflection;Optical sensors;Real time systems","image sensors;mobile robots;robot vision","environmental recognition;forward-hemispherical vision sensor;hemispherical forward visual field;inertial measurement unit;map generation;microelectromechanical systems;mobile robot;omnidirectional vision;panoramic image;panoramic integration map;real time kinematics-global positioning system;remote control","","2","","","","","22-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
