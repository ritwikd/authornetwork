ISSCC. 2002 IEEE International","20020807","2002","1","","24","27 vol.1","Information technology (IT) emerged from the 1970s based on main-frame computers. Since then, PCs and the Internet world have drastically expanded the IT industry along with rapid growth of network and communication technology. For almost all platforms, semiconductor memories have been a key enabling technology. In the PC era, DRAM density increase has been driven by rapid expansion of applications with advanced operating systems. In the future, servers will continue driving high-density DRAM requirements, and the maximum memory size of servers will be one of the key performance parameters. 512 Mb DRAM will be widely available in 2002 and 16 Gb DRAM is expected to appear within the next 10 years. Performance of semiconductor memories will be driven by graphics applications and network systems. 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be popular in 2002 and 2 Gb/s/pin in 2004 for high-end graphics applications. Random-access times in the range of 5 ns for SRAM and 20 ns for DRAM range and 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be available in 2002, and even faster (frequency, latency) memories will be required for high-end network systems such as OC-768-based switches and routers and beyond. Mobile platforms, especially 3 G phones and PDAs, are driving low-voltage low-power memories. Standby power of DRAM and pseudo-SRAM has been reduced drastically over the last 2 years. 1.8 V DRAM will be in volume production in 2002 and 1.0 V DRAM is expected in 2005 for longer battery life and moving-picture capability of mobile applications. The small-form-factor requirement of mobile phones and consumer applications such as PDA, and DSC will expedite various multi-chip-package solutions such as SRAM+Flash, DRAM+Flash, and SRAM+DRAM+Flash. Recent digital convergence and the rapid reduction of $/MB of mass storage flash memory increased the usage of flash memory in various mobile and consumer applications. Semiconductor memory will continue to follow Moore's Law for at least the next 10 years and will be lead by ma- s storage flash memory technology. Memory requirement of various IT platforms will continue to increase the trend of MB/system and MB/person.","","0-7803-7335-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2002.992921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992921","","Batteries;Communication industry;Flash memory;Graphics;IP networks;Information technology;Network servers;Personal communication networks;Random access memory;Semiconductor memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;application specific integrated circuits;flash memories;information technology;integrated circuit economics;integrated circuit packaging;mobile radio;technological forecasting","3 G phones;DRAM;IT users;PDA;SRAM;battery life;customization;efficiency;flash memories;memory bit cost;memory business;mobile applications;mobile phones;packaging;semiconductor memories;small-form-factor requirement","","9","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2002","03 Feb 2002-07 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This enables applications such as smart buildings and highways, environment monitoring, user interfaces, entertainment, factory automation, and robotics While the aggregate system processes large amounts of data, individual nodes participate in a small fraction only (typical data rates <1 kb/s). These ubiquitous networks require that the individual nodes are tiny, easily integratable into the environment, and have negligible cost. The challenges and opportunities in the design of integrated wireless sensor and actuator nodes, to be used in such self-configuring ad-hoc networks, are described. To be viable, the node must be smaller than a couple of mm/sup 3/, cost <$1, and consume <100 μW, allowing for energy scavenging from the environment.","","0-7803-7335-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2002.993005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993005","","Actuators;Automated highways;Computerized monitoring;Costs;Intelligent sensors;Robotic assembly;Smart buildings;Transceivers;User interfaces;Wireless sensor networks","CMOS integrated circuits;actuators;data communication equipment;digital radio;low-power electronics;radio applications;radio networks;sensors;transceivers","1 to 10 kbit/s;CMOS-designated functions;distributed networks;integrated wireless actuator nodes;integrated wireless sensor nodes;low-cost wireless transceivers;ultra-low power design;wireless data;wireless sensor networks","","117","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2002","03 Feb 2002-07 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People want to have fun, feel free, enjoy life, feel secure, be in control and be productive. This experience is not linked to one particular device but is realized by a network of devices present in the environment that will provide us these experiences in an intelligent way. Ambient Intelligence is introduced as a new paradigm in consumer electronics. Some of the technologies required for Ambient Intelligence are covered, with a focus on IC consequences. Ongoing work in three fields is described: ubiquitous radio, intuitive user/system interfaces and three-dimensional visual displays. These three fields highlight the diverse nature of Ambient Intelligence technologies as well as the resulting requirements for ICs.

ISSCC. 2002 IEEE International","20020807","2002","1","","18","21 vol.1","Internet electronic products have requirements different from those of personal computers (PCs). The increasing importance of Internet electronics is driving changes in development of IC technology. One important characteristic of the Internet Age is computational disaggregation. Whereas, over the past 20 years, PCs have been characterized by ever-increasing computation capabilities, emerging Internet electronic products are characterized by sufficient computation to achieve the function in a small, often portable, form factor. The imperative for lower cost, which enables penetration into mass markets, is a second area where Internet electronic products differ from PCs. Disaggregation and cost requirements are driving an unprecedented degree of system-on-a-chip (SoC) integration. In the Internet Age, SoC integration means more than integrating different digital cores. It also means integrating functions that are realized today in different technologies: logic, memory, analog, power management, passives and radio or wireline driver, depending on the product. Because SoC integration is motivated primarily by cost, diverse functions must be integrated together in standard CMOS with minimal cost addition. Cost-effective embedded memory technology also needs to be developed. Current examples of SoC integration include cell phones, cable/DSL modems, and Internet audio. These representative examples, together with others, are driving changes in the way ICs are developed. In the latter half of the decade, it is likely that SoC integration will expand to include MEMS, microphotonics, and on-chip energy sources. Moore's Law scaling will continue at least through the end of this decade, but SoC integration will become an increasingly important technology imperative for continued cost reduction throughout the Internet Age.","","0-7803-7335-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2002.992920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992920","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Consumer electronics;Cost function;Internet;Memory management;Microcomputers;Personal communication networks;Portable computers;System-on-a-chip","CMOS integrated circuits;Internet;cellular radio;integrated circuit economics;integrated circuit technology;low-power electronics;modems;power consumption;random-access storage","CMOS IC;IC technology;Internet audio;Internet electronics;RAM;SoC integration;cable/DSL modems;cell phones;computational disaggregation;cost;embedded memory;power management","","13","","","","","7-7 Feb. 2002","03 Feb 2002-07 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The retina can be stimulated from either side (epiretinal (M. Ortmanns et al., 2007) or subretinal (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), (E. Zrenner, 2002)). With a subretinal light sensitive chip, the natural optical system of the eye is still used, allowing the patient to intuitively locate objects. The patient was 1 out of 7, who have been implanted in a clinical study in 2006 in Tuebingen, Germany (E. Zrenner et al., 2007). The space beneath the retina is limited. Either just an electrode array is placed there (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), or a silicon chip thinned to about 70mum, or both. The experiments (E. Zrenner et al., 2007) used a device including a light-sensitive CMOS chip and separate direct stimulation electrodes. The device was connected to an external power supply by a polyimide-ribbon (comparable to (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), however much longer), forming a flexible connection into the eyeball. Feasibility of the wired supply approach for humans was proven; no perception of the ribbon was reported by the patients. After 5 weeks, all implants were removed, and no damage of the patient's retina was observed.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523098","","Driver circuits;Electrodes;Impedance;Implants;Rectifiers;Retina;Switches;Tin;Variable structure systems;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;electrodes;eye;prosthetics;visual perception","DC-free terminals;blind patients;direct stimulation electrodes;electrode array;external power supply;eye;light-sensitive CMOS chip;natural optical system;polyimide-ribbon;retinal implants;subretinal light sensitive chip;visual perception","","5","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We named the sensor ""ISIS-V2"", for In-situ Storage Image Sensor Version 2.103 memory elements are attached to every pixel; generated image signals were instantly and continuously stored in the in-situ storage without being read out of the sensor. The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side. The CCM is a CCD-specific efficient signal-amplification device. CCM, combined with the BSI structure and cooling, achieved very high sensitivity. The ISIS-V12 was a test sensor intended to prove the technical feasibility of the structure. The maximum frame rate was 250kfps for a charge-handling capacity of Q<sub>max</sub>=10,000e and 1Mfps for a reduced Q<sub>max</sub>. The pixel count was 489x400 pixels. For backside-illuminated (BSI) image sensors, metal wires can be placed on the front surface to increase the frame rate without reducing fill factor or violating uniformity of the pixel configuration. It has been proved by simulations that 100Mfps is achievable by introducing innovative technologies including a special wiring method. We now report on ISIS-V16, developed by incorporating technologies to increase the frame rate with those to achieve very high sensitivity, which was confirmed by evaluation of ISIS-V12.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746372","","Charge coupled devices;Choppers;Image sensors;Measurement by laser beam;Photonics;Pixel;Sensitivity","CCD image sensors;high-speed techniques","BSI structure;CCD image sensor;ISIS structure;ISIS-V16;backside-illuminated image sensor;charge-carrier multiplication;charge-handling capacity;cooling;frame rate;high-speed recording;image signal;memory element;metal wire;parallel recording;pixel configuration;pixel count;signal-amplification device;storage image sensor;wiring method","","8","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SAR architectures have been recently demonstrated as able to achieve high power efficiency in the moderate-resolution/medium- bandwidth range in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007). However, when the comparator determines in first instance the overall performance, as in most SAR ADCs, comparator thermal noise can limit the maximum achievable resolution. More than 1 and 2 ENOB reductions are observed in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007) and Kuttner, F., (2002), respectively, because of thermal noise, and degradations could be even worse with scaled supply voltages and the extensive use of dynamic regenerative latches without pre-amplification. Unlike mismatch, random noise cannot be compensated by calibration and would finally demand a quadratic increase in power consumption unless alternative circuit techniques are devised.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523145","","Adders;Calibration;Energy consumption;Error correction;Frequency conversion;Phase noise;Phased arrays;Sampling methods;Solid state circuits;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits);flip-flops;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;thermal noise","ENOB reductions;SAR architectures;analog/mixed-signal design;battery-powered devices;comparator thermal noise;digital CMOS;dynamic regenerative latches;noise-tolerant dynamic-SAR ADC;power consumption;random noise;supply voltages","","21","11","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","454","627","DLL clock multipliers outperform their PLL counterparts in terms of phase noise because they have significantly less jitter accumulation [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
