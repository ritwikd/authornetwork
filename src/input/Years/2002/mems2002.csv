The μPEC harnesses the natural metabolic processes (photosynthesis and respiration) of the blue-green algae Anabaena to convert light energy into electrical power. In both light and dark conditions, the μPEC produced an open-circuit potential of over 400 mV, a current density of over 30 μA/cm<sup>2</sup> with a 10-Ω load, and a power density of 61 μW/L. These results are generally comparable to the microfabricated microbial fuel cell by Chiao et. al. (2002), though lower than those of micro solar cells and of macroscale MFCs and PECs. However, unlike solar cells, the μPEC has the ability to produce power in the dark; and unlike methanol or microbial fuel cells, no fuel is required.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189768","","Algae;Anodes;Circuits;Electrons;Fuel cells;Microelectromechanical devices;Microorganisms;Photovoltaic cells;Remote sensing;Sugar","bioelectric phenomena;photoelectrochemical cells","10 ohm;400 mV;blue-green algae Anabaena;micro photosynthetic electrochemical cell;mobile MEMS devices;open-circuit potential;remote sensors;self-sustained power source","","4","","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complete architecture of the oscillator is designed to control the oscillation amplitudes. The novelty of this paper is the use of an MRC (MOS resistive circuit) as active element to control the gain. The differential structure of the MRC is suitable for a high temperature environment (200°C). Each of the cells of the oscillator have been designed and simulated at transistor level in a standard 0.6 μm CMOS technology.

Using the first order slip formulas and experimental data, we also extracted Tangential Momentum Accommodation Coefficient (TMAC) of 0.204 for the case of air flowing through a microchannel of Pyrex glass and silicon at atmospheric conditions. Increased mass flow over the incompressible flow case is due to both compressibility and rarefaction. Deviations from the linear incompressible distributions get larger with the inlet to outlet pressure ratio. The dimensionless streamwise location of the maximum deviations is slightly less than 0.6, which is skewed slightly downstream of the middle of the channel. It is notable that these experimental data are much closer to the simulation results of 0.55 than those of Pong et al.(2002), 0.4 , which have been the most frequently cited experimental data for the pressure distribution in uniform and straight micro channels.","1084-6999","0-7803-7744-3","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2003.1189742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189742","","Bonding;Boundary conditions;Fluid flow measurement;Glass;Measurement units;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Pressure measurement;Sensor arrays;Silicon","channel flow;compressible flow;flow measurement;microfluidics;pressure measurement","Pyrex glass/Si microchannel;TMAC measurements;Tangential Momentum Accommodation Coefficient;anodically bonded microchannels;compressibility;first order slip formulas;incompressible flow case;mass flow measurements;microchannel;near unity aspect ratio;pressure distributions;rarefaction;sputter etching","","0","1","","","","19-23 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the experimental study, we fabricate two different microdiffuser prototypes, having the neck widths of 100 μm (D100) and 300 μm (D300), respectively. The prototypes, D100 and D300, show the maximum net flow rates of 116.6 μl/min and 344.4 μl/min, respectively, for an identical piezoelectric flow actuation using the sinusoidal drive voltage of 100 V p-p at 50 Hz.

The experimental flow rate of D300, however, decreases from 47% of the theoretical values at the flow frequencies higher than 90 Hz, at which the net boundary layer thickness is reduced to the microdiffuser neck width.

The sealing plate is center-anchored on top of a chamber diaphragm that is vacuum-collapsed to the bottom of the chamber in order to achieve a normally closed position. A thin gold layer on the roughened valve seat surface is used to reduce stiction between the sealing plate and the valve seat. We have achieved an in-channel check valve with a cracking (opening) pressure of 20~40 kPa under forward bias and no measurable leakage under reverse bias up to 270 kPa. Using this design, this valve performs well in two-phase microfluidic systems (i.e. microchannel flows containing gas, liquid, or gas/liquid mixture)","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838492","","Fluidic microsystems;Gold;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Micromechanical devices;Pumps;Rough surfaces;Silicon;Surface roughness;Valves","conformal coatings;diaphragms;etching;microfluidics;micromachining;microvalves;polymer films","20 to 40 kPa;270 kPa;chamber diaphragm;circular sealing plate;etching;five-layer process;forward bias;in-channel micro check valve;lab-on-chip;microchannel flows;normally closed valve;opening pressure;parylene check valve;passive device;reverse bias;ring-shaped valve seat;stiction reduction;surface-micromachined;thin gold layer;two-phase microfluidic systems;vacuum-collapsed","","9","4","6","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is shown that a special isolation technique is suitable to separate the electrical potentials on the movable elements and therefore allows to excite the two oscillations independently. The isolation technique is based on the oxidation and polysilicon filling of 1 μm wide trenches in the 30 μm thick layer of silicon. The influence of the surrounding gas on the coupling of the oscillations is examined. No significant influence is observed.

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating.

The integrated microchip is able to detect electrophoretic signals in real time along the whole microchannel as a two-dimensional image. The microfabrication process named “stereolithography with double controlled surface (SD method)” has been newly proposed in order to realize a highly transparent microchannel with a smooth surface without assembly processes such as bonding of two plates. The accuracy of fabrication is within 5% of the design values. We have also evaluated the performance of the fabricated microchip and confirmed its functionality. After a sample (Blue Dextran) was injected into the microchannel, significant values of absorbance were obtained from the photosensor along the whole microchannel. The absorbance was proportional to the concentration of Blue Dextran","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838612","","Assembly;Chemical sensors;Etching;Fabrication;Microchannel;Microfluidics;Rough surfaces;Signal detection;Stereolithography;Surface roughness","electrochemical analysis;electrophoresis;microfluidics;photolithography","Blue Dextran;absorbance;acrylic microfluidic channel;double controlled surface;fabrication;integrated micro-electrophoretic chip;micro integrated fluid system;micro-total chemical analysis system;photosensor array;stereolithographic process;two-dimensional imaging","","0","","10","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As 3D multiple-step structured nozzles are required for straight and high frequency ink ejection, it was formed by ICP deep-RIE employing a “multiple-step mask method” which makes troublesome stereo-photolithography unnecessary and 128 nozzles/chip were fabricated simultaneously. The required thin, 2 μm-thick pressure plates were formed by B doped etch-stop technology combined with two-step alkaline etching which enables smooth-surfaced and uniform (2.15±0.35 (3 σ)μm) pressure plates. The typical driving voltage is 26.5 V and the SEAJet head has achieved the uniform ink ejection up to a driving frequency of 18 kHz. The life of the actuator has been confirmed to be more than 4 billion times actuation. The typical printing speed of the POS printer is 15 1/s (lines per second) for a rolled paper and 3 ppm (papers per min.) for A4 paper in 360 dpi (dots per inch) high resolution, a performance level that makes this the fastest inkjet POS printer in the world.

Each of these nozzles is connected to a distinct fluidic reservoir constituting the interface to the macro world. To allow an automated replenishing of the chip, the alignment of the reservoirs is amenable for liquid handling via standard pipetting robots. Depending on the design of the print head, a maximum of 20 μl can be stored thus allowing one to dispend about 20.000 droplets of equal quality in a row.

At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system.

Numerical analysis shows that the actuated micromirror can satisfy the tracking speed imposed by the requirement on the access time for the high-density optical data storage up to few tens Gbit/in<sup>2</sup>.

To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves.

The individual pixels are turned ON and OFF by pairs of microscopic thermal actuators, while the main vibration is generated by a vibrating piezo-electric plate. The physiological parameters required for inducing tactile illusion are described. The fabrication sequence for the thermal microactuators along with actuation results are also presented","","0-7803-7480-0","","10.1109/MMB.2002.1002342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1002342","","Communication channels;Injuries;Man machine systems;Micromechanical devices;Microscopy;Nervous system;Piezoelectric actuators;Skin;System testing;Vibrations","biomedical equipment;finite element analysis;microactuators;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;piezoelectric actuators;tactile sensors","MEMS actuator array;central nervous system injury;complex symbols;coupled finite element analysis;discrete mechanical actuators;fabrication sequence;fingertip tactile communication;human-machine communication;metal-polymer composite beams;micro-clutch MEMS technology;microscopic thermal actuators;neurophysiological testing;peripheral nervous system injury;somatotopic activation;tactile array;tactile illusion;tactile perception;vibrating piezoelectric plate;vibrating pixels","","0","","","","","2002","02 May 2002-04 May 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, ultrasonic bonding can be broadly applied not only for electrical interconnection, but also for hermetic MEMS sealing and packaging especially where temperature limitation is a critical issue.

The Fifteenth IEEE International Conference on","20020807","2002","","","677","680","This paper reports on the hermeticity testing of MEMS cavities using BCB as the sealing and bonding material. Hermeticity has been tested according to the MIL-STD-883D. Gross leak testing based on liquid fluorocarbons revealed that BCB sealed cavities are leak tight, which means that the MEMS devices are well protected during handling and back-end processing (e.g., wafer dicing). Further, it is shown that the He fine leak testing of the MIL-STD is not fully applicable to small volumes (<1000 nl), typically encountered for MEMS. The problem is that the undefined regime normally existing in the MIL-STD is largely extended for small cavity volumes. Microbolometers have been used as test vehicles to confirm this. Large (>10,000 nl) cavities are needed to cover the entire leakage spectrum.","1084-6999","0-7803-7185-2","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2002.984361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984361","","Helium;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromechanical devices;Protection;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Sealing materials;Switches;Testing;Vehicles;Wafer bonding","leak detection;micromechanical devices;packaging;polymers;seals (stoppers)","BCB-sealed cavity;He;MIL-STD-883D;RF MEMS device housing;back-end processing;bonding material;hermeticity testing;leak testing;liquid fluorocarbon;microbolometer;wafer dicing","","27","5","","","","24-24 Jan. 2002","20 Jan 2002-24 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Efficient and accurate analysis tool that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the Pull-In state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the Pull-In state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the voltage iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). A relaxation based DIPIE scheme that requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers is suggested. Therefore, it can be easily implemented into existing MOEMS CAD packages. Moreover, using the DIPIE scheme, the Pull-In parameters extraction can be performed in a fully automated mode, and no user input for search bounds is required.","1084-6999","0-7803-7185-2","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2002.984239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984239","","Computational modeling;Convergence;Electrodes;Electrostatic actuators;Geometry;Iterative algorithms;Microelectromechanical devices;Packaging;Parameter extraction;Voltage","CAD;convergence of numerical methods;electrostatic actuators;iterative methods;relaxation theory","DIPIE algorithm;MEMS device;VI algorithm;computer aided design;convergence;displacement iteration pull-in extraction;electrostatic actuator;pull-in parameters;relaxation method;voltage iteration","","0","1","","","","24-24 Jan. 2002","20 Jan 2002-24 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Temperature plateaus are observed in the boiling curves, corresponding to the latent heat of phase change of the working fluid from liquid to vapor phase. The evolving two-phase flow patterns have been recorded and analyzed using high-speed camera. Bubble formation, growth and detachment at specific nucleation sites have been observed.

An application of the through-wafer interconnects to a concept demonstration of thin-film polysilicon resistive igniters for the microengine showed that it was possible to initiate combustion and locally raise the temperature of the igniter to 900/spl deg/C so long as the chip is thermally isolated. The results were found to be in good agreement with the predictions of an FEM thermal model. The possibility of using the resistors as temperature sensors is also examined.

We demonstrate that at this scale, mass inertia force can overcome surface forces and be used for non-contact self-assembly of MEMS structures. A centrifugal force was applied to hinged MUMPs#31 structures, causing these structures to self-assemble by rotating themselves 90/spl deg/ out of substrate plane and to lock themselves automatically to designed latches. This batch-assembly technique is very fast, low-cost, non-contact, and non-destructive. Moreover, we have successfully characterized the centrifugal forces needed to assemble these microstructures by integrating sensors on the same MUMPs chips to provide wireless signals that relate to the dynamic behavior of the microstructures.

ICOPS 2002. IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. The 29th IEEE International Conference on","20021107","2002","","","262","","Summary form only given. Plasma processes using high-density sources have been extensively developed to meet more and more stringent constraints required by integrated circuits fabrication. Among the various steps, dielectric etching is the more challenging as the process relies on polymerizing hydrofluorocarbon gases that produce simultaneously deposition and etching. It is thus difficult to achieve adequate SiO/sub 2//mask etch selectivity and to continue etching in high aspect ratio features at the same time. More recently, the development of integrated optical components leads to new technological challenges in particular concerning deep etching (= 10 gm). Hence, fabrication of MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems)and O-MEMS (Optical MEMS) requires several conditions: (i) a higher etch rate to reduce the process time (400 nm/min), (ii) an extreme selectivity (> 15), (iii) a much longer etching process. In order to improve SiO/sub 2//Si selectivity, there have been several studies of high density plasma etching processes. Usually, selective etching of silicon oxide with a silicon mask is obtained in RIE plasmas using fluorocarbon gases. The formation of a fluorocarbon film by CF/sub n/ radical deposition on the silicon surface reduces the silicon etch rate whereas oxide etching is weakly affected leading to a considerable improvement of the selectivity. However, the low ion flux generated by the RIE system leads to very low oxide etch rates less than 50 nm/min. In contrast, in high density plasma sources, the high degree of dissociation and the high ionic density enable to reach higher oxide etch rates (> 200 nm/min). Nevertheless, the SiO/sub 2//Si selectivity is strongly affected. The present work is based, in a first step, on the comparison between three fluorocarbon gases (CF/sub 4/, C/sub 2/H/sub 6/, CHF/sub 3/) and their mixture with hydrogen or methane for a better understanding of the selective etching of SiO/sub 2/ using a silicon mask. We show that a- ding methane instead of hydrogen to any fluorocarbon gas allows to increase considerably the SiO/sub 2//Si selectivity without decreasing too much the oxide etch rate. However, we demonstrate that is not possible to increase both the selectivity and the etch rate by changing the hydrofluorocarbon mixture, and that the only way to obtain this combined increase, is to reduce the gas residence time. Finally, pattern transfer into silicon dioxide with high SiO/sub 2//Si selectivity was performed with success.","","0-7803-7407-X","","10.1109/PLASMA.2002.1030545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030545","","Etching;Fabrication;Gases;Hydrogen;Lead compounds;Micromechanical devices;Plasma applications;Plasma density;Plasma sources;Silicon","integrated optics;plasma density;silicon compounds;sputter etching","CF/sub n/ radical deposition;IC fabrication;RIE plasmas;Si;SiO/sub 2/;SiO/sub 2//Si selectivity;SiO/sub 2//mask etch selectivity;deep etching;dissociation;etch rates;fluorocarbon film formation;fluorocarbon gases;fluoroform;gas residence time;hexafluoroethane;high aspect ratio features;high density low pressure fluorocarbon plasma;high ionic density;high-density sources;hydrofluorocarbon gases;hydrofluorocarbon mixture;integrated circuits;ion flux generation;micro electro mechanical systems;oxide etch rate;pattern transfer;plasma sources;polymerisation;process time;selective etching;selectivity;silicon mask;tetrafluoromethane;trifluoromethane","","0","","","","","26-30 May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At stresses significantly below the yield strength, substantial creep deformation was also observed at moderately elevated temperatures. The fatigue life of the LIGA Ni microsamples increased with decreasing stress amplitude in a manner comparable to what has been reported for wrought Ni.

This technique utilizes high-frequency acoustic energy to provide the heat pumping effect. The goal of the Rockwell Scientific-led HERETIC (Heat Removal by Thermo-Integrated Circuits) project is the development and demonstration of a miniaturized refrigeration device based on the thermoacoustic refrigeration principle. Utilizing MEMS technology such as high aspect ratio through wafer etching, bonding and coating techniques, three to four mm thick bonded MEM-TAR (Thermoacoustic Refrigerator) stacks with only 10 to 15 micron wide fine patterns were demonstrated. With our current design, numerical models predict device capability of 1 W heat transport at 20/spl deg/C below ambient when pressurized with 10 atm of He/Ar gas mixture. Preliminary results using 1 atm air achieve as high as 10 degrees of stable cooling below ambient.","1084-6999","0-7803-7185-2","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2002.984226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984226","","Acoustic devices;Circuits;Etching;Heat pumps;Micromechanical devices;Optoelectronic devices;Refrigeration;Thermal management;Thermal management of electronics;Wafer bonding","micromachining;refrigeration;thermal management (packaging);thermoacoustics","1 W;1 atm;10 atm;HERETIC;He-Ar;He/Ar gas mixture;MEMS technology;coating technique;electronic device;heat pumping;heat transport;high aspect ratio structure;micromachined stack component;numerical model;optoelectronic device;thermal management;thermoacoustic refrigerator;wafer bonding;wafer etching","","0","","","","","24-24 Jan. 2002","20 Jan 2002-24 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We proposed and successfully demonstrated a simple method named Micro-Origami to make self-positioning micro-machined three-dimensional structures by using the strain in a pair of lattice-mismatched GaAs/InGaAs epitaxial layers grown on GaAs substrates. Micro-Origami is expected to become a viable fundamental technique for developing MOEMS devices with complex three-dimensional structures. However, the precision of the three-dimensional structures fabricated by Micro-Origami is supposed to be strongly affected by the fabrication process, because of the self-positioning mechanism. In this paper, we report on the fabrication of a free-standing plate and a retro-reflector, as examples of Micro-Origami devices, and discuss the design and fabrication precision.","","0-7803-7595-5","","10.1109/OMEMS.2002.1031434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031434","","Capacitive sensors;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Fabrication;Fasteners;Gallium arsenide;Indium gallium arsenide;Shape;Stress;Substrates;Wet etching","III-V semiconductors;gallium arsenide;indium compounds;micro-optics;micromachining;optical design techniques;optical fabrication;semiconductor epitaxial layers","GaAs;GaAs substrate;GaAs-InGaAs;MOEMS technology;Micro-Origami Device;design method;fabrication process;free-standing plate;lattice-mismatched GaAs/InGaAs epitaxial layer;retro-reflector;self-positioning micromachined three-dimensional structure","","0","","","","","20-23 Aug. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Fifteenth IEEE International Conference on","20020807","2002","","","614","617","We report here the first characterization of dielectric charging effects on Parylene electrostatic actuators. High-resistivity Parylene in-between air gaps can cause undesirable charging effects due to air ionization when operating as electrostatic sensors/actuators at voltages as low as tens of volts. This undesirable effect can either lower the sensitivity of the sensor or increase the pull-in voltage of the actuator. It is further observed that Parylene actuators operating at high voltage could even show ""bounce-back"" and ""pull-in voltage drift"" problems. It is concluded that even for MEMS, attention must be paid to the operating voltages and the resistivity of the dielectrics.","1084-6999","0-7803-7185-2","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2002.984346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984346","","Conducting materials;Dielectric materials;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Electrostatic actuators;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromechanical devices;Microstructure;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Structural beams;Threshold voltage","conducting polymers;dielectric relaxation;electrostatic actuators;surface charging","MEMS;Parylene electrostatic actuators;air gaps;air ionization;bounce-back problems;dielectric charging effects;electrostatic sensors/actuators;pull-in voltage drift problems","","5","","","","","24-24 Jan. 2002","20 Jan 2002-24 Jan 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
