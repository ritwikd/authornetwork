The advent of single-chip microprocessor/FPGA platforms makes such partitioning even more attractive. Previous partitioning approaches have partitioned sequential program source code, such as C or C++. We introduce a new approach that partitions at the software binary level. Although source code partitioning is preferable from a purely technical viewpoint, binary-level partitioning provides several very practical benefits for commercial acceptance. We demonstrate that binary-level partitioning yields competitive speedup results compared to source-level partitioning, achieving an average speedup of 1.4 compared to 1.5 for eight benchmarks partitioned on a single-chip microprocessor/FPGA device.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167529","","Application software;Assembly;Computer architecture;Coprocessors;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Parallel processing;Reconfigurable logic;Software tools;Voltage","circuit CAD;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;logic partitioning;microprocessor chips","average speedup;binary-level partitioning;custom hardware;embedded system application;hardware/software partitioning;microprocessor;sequential program source code partitioning;single-chip microprocessor/FPGA platforms;software binaries;software binary level partitioning;source-level partitioning","","17","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has various advantages such as low complexity, high flexibility and ease of implementation. Existing net weighting algorithms, however, are often ad-hoc. There is generally no known good net weighting algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel net weighting algorithm based on the concept of path-counting, and apply it in a timing-driven FPGA placement application. Theoretically this is the first ever known accurate, all-path counting algorithm. Experimental data shows that compared with the weighting algorithm used in state-of-the-art FPGA placement package VPR (A. Marquardt et al, ACM Symp. on FPGAs, pp. 203-213, 2000), this new algorithm can achieve the longest path delay reduction of up to 38.8%, 15.6% on average with no runtime overhead and only a 4.1% increase in total wirelength.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167530","","Circuits;Clocks;Delay;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Mathematical programming;Packaging;Pins;Runtime;Timing","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD;timing","FPGA placement;ad-hoc weighting algorithms;all-path counting algorithm;net weighting algorithm;path delay reduction;path-counting;placement complexity;placement flexibility;placement implementation;runtime overhead;timing-driven placement;total wirelength","","25","3","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20030129","2002","","","663","670","The communication sub-system of complex IC systems is increasingly critical for achieving system performance. Given this, it is important that the on-chip communication architecture should be included in any quantitative evaluation of system design during design space exploration. While there are several mature methodologies for the modeling and evaluation of architectures of processing elements, there is relatively little work done in modeling of an extensive range of on-chip communication architectures, and integrating this into a single modeling and simulation environment combining processing element and on-chip communication architectures. This paper describes a modeling framework with accompanying simulation tools that attempts to fill this gap. Based on an analysis of a wide range of on-chip communication architectures, we describe how a specific hierarchical class library can be used to develop new on-chip communication architectures, or variants of existing ones with relatively little incremental effort. We demonstrate this through three case studies including two commercial on-chip bus systems and an on-chip packet switching network.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167603","","Computer architecture;Instruction sets;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Space exploration;Spine;Terminology;Virtual prototyping","circuit CAD;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic CAD;logic simulation;packet switching;system buses;system-on-chip","OCA;SoC;complex IC system communication sub-systems;design space exploration;hierarchical class libraries;on-chip bus systems;on-chip communication architecture hierarchical modeling framework;on-chip packet switching networks;processing element modeling/evaluation;simulation tools;system-on-a-chip","","26","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A layout must be partitioned into these subfields on mask and then stitched back together by the EPL tool on wafer. To minimize possible stitching errors, partitioning of a mask layout should minimize cuts of layout features in the overlapping area between two adjacent sub-fields. This paper presents the first formulation of the mask layout partitioning problem for EPL as a graph problem. The graph formulation is optimally solved with a shortest path approach. Two other techniques are also presented to speed up computation.

We show that the problem stems from fast oscillations in envelopes that are expected to be slowly varying. We demonstrate that this is related to the fact that the envelope equations are always stiff, whether or not the underlying system is. We show that careful choice of envelope initial conditions is necessary to obtain useful solutions, and propose two techniques for finding good initial conditions. Applying these, and solving the envelope equations with stiffly-stable numerical methods, we improve the robustness and reliability of Fourier-envelope methods.

Extensive experimental results show that for LUT-based FPGAs, the rewiring ability of our new algorithm is 70% higher than SPFD-based local rewiring algorithms (SPFD-LR) and 18% higher than the recently developed SPFD-based global rewiring algorithm (SPFD-GR). (2) In order to achieve more rewiring ability on certain selected wires used in various optimizations, we study the impact of using different atomic SPFD pair assignment methods during the SPFD-based rewiring. We develop several heuristic atomic SPFD pair assignment methods for area or delay minimization and show that they lead to 10% more selected rewiring ability than the random (or arbitrary) assignment methods.

In this paper, we show how the simultaneous use of adaptive body biasing (ABB) and DVS can be used to reduce power in high-performance processors. Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as functions of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. We then show how to determine the correct trade-off between supply voltage and body bias for a given clock frequency and duration of operation. The usefulness of our approach is evaluated on real workloads obtained using real-time monitoring of processor utilization for four applications. The results demonstrate that application of simultaneous DVS and ABB results in an average energy reduction of 48% over DVS alone.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167611","","Analytical models;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Leakage current;Microprocessors;Monitoring;SPICE;Voltage control","SPICE;circuit optimisation;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit modelling;leakage currents;logic design;logic simulation;microprocessor chips","SPICE;adaptive body biasing;dynamic power;dynamic voltage scaling;high-performance processor power consumption reduction;leakage power/current modeling;lower power microprocessors;microprocessors dynamic workloads;optimization;processor clock frequency/supply voltage;processor utilization real-time monitoring;simultaneous DVS/ABB;supply voltage/body bias trade-off","","138","13","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20030129","2002","","","450","457","Optimized solvers for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem have many applications in areas such as hardware and software verification, FPGA routing, planning, etc. Further uses are complicated by the need to express ""counting constraints"" in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Expressing such constraints by pure CNF leads to more complex SAT instances. Alternatively, those constraints can be handled by Integer Linear Programming (ILP), but generic ILP solvers may ignore the Boolean nature of 0-1 variables. Therefore specialized 0-1 ILP solvers extend SAT solvers to handle these so-called ""pseudo-Boolean"" constraints. This work provides an update on the on-going competition between generic ILP techniques and specialized 0-1 ILP techniques. To make a fair comparison, we generalize recent ideas for fast SAT-solving to more general 0-1 ILP problems that may include counting constraints and optimization. Another aspect of our comparison is evaluation on 0-1 ILP benchmarks that originate in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), but that cannot be directly solved by a SAT solver. Specifically, we solve instances of the Max-SAT and Max-ONEs optimization problems which seek to maximize the number of satisfied clauses and the ""true"" values over all satisfying assignments, respectively. Those problems have straightforward applications to SAT-based routing and are additionally important due to reductions from Max-Cut, Max-Clique, and Min Vertex Cover.

The potential energy savings are strongly related to the energy profile of a circuit. These savings are obtained by using gate sizing, supply voltage, and threshold voltage optimization, to minimize energy consumption subject to a delay constraint. The true power minimization is achieved when the energy reduction potentials of all tuning variables are balanced. We derive the sensitivity of energy to delay for each of the tuning variables, connecting its energy saving potential to the physical properties of the circuit. This helps to develop understanding of optimization performance and identify the most efficient techniques for energy reduction. The optimizations are applied to some examples that span typical circuit topologies including inverter chains, SRAM decoders, and adders. At a delay of 20% larger than the minimum, energy savings of 40% to 70% are possible, indicating that achieving peak performance is expensive in terms of energy. Energy savings of about 50% can be achieved without delay penalty with the balancing of sizes, supplies, and thresholds.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167511","","Circuit optimization;Circuit topology;Constraint optimization;Delay;Energy consumption;Inverters;Joining processes;Minimization methods;Potential energy;Threshold voltage","SRAM chips;adders;circuit optimisation;circuit tuning;delays;integrated circuit design;logic design;logic gates;low-power electronics;minimisation;network topology","SRAM decoders;adders;circuit energy profile;circuit level power minimization;circuit physical properties;circuit topologies;delay constraint;energy reduction potentials;energy savings;energy sensitivity;gate sizing;inverter chains;micro-architectural level power minimization;optimization performance;peak performance;power minimization methods;supply voltage optimization;threshold voltage optimization;tuning variables","","42","7","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, to achieve timing closure in DSM technology, it is very necessary and critical to consider the interconnect delay at an early stage of the synthesis process. It has been known that resource sharing in high-level synthesis is one of the major synthesis tasks which greatly affect the final synthesis/layout results. In this paper, we propose a new layout-driven resource sharing approach to overcome some of the limitations of the previous works in which the effects of layout on the synthesis have never been taken into account or considered in local and limited ways, or whose computation time is excessively large. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (step 1) we relax the integrated resource sharing and placement into an efficient linear programming (LP) formulation based on the concept of discretizing placement space; and (step 2) we derive a feasible solution from the solution obtained in Step 1. Then, we employ an iterative mechanism based on the two steps to tightly integrate resource sharing and placement tasks so that the slack time violation due to interconnect delay (determined by placement) as well as logic delay (determined by resource sharing) should be minimized. From experiments using a set of benchmark designs, it is shown that the approach is effective, and efficient, completely removing the slack time violation produced by conventional methods.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167596","","Computer science;Delay effects;Delay estimation;High level synthesis;Information technology;Linear programming;Logic gates;Resource management;Time sharing computer systems;Timing","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;delays;high level synthesis;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;iterative methods;linear programming;timing","DSM technology;deep submicron technology;high-level synthesis;interconnect delay;iterative mechanism;layout-driven resource sharing;linear programming formulation;logic delay;placement space discretization;placement tasks;slack time violation;timing closure","","8","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a methodology for high-level synthesis (HLS) of distributed logic-memory architectures, i.e., architectures that have logic and memory distributed across several partitions in a chip. Conventional HLS tools are capable of extracting parallelism from a behavior for architectures that assume a monolithic controller/datapath communicating with a memory or memory hierarchy. This work provides techniques to extend the synthesis frontier to more general architectures that can extract both coarse- and fine-grained parallelism from data accesses and computations in a synergistic manner. Our methodology selects many possible ways of organizing data and computations, carefully examines the trade-offs (i.e., communication overheads, synchronization costs, area overheads) in choosing one solution over another, and utilizes conventional HLS techniques for intermediate steps. We have evaluated the proposed framework on several benchmarks by generating register-transfer level (RTL) implementations using an existing commercial HLS tool with and without our enhancements, and by subjecting the resulting RTL circuits to logic synthesis and layout. The results show that circuits designed as distributed logic-memory architectures using our framework achieve significant (up to 5.31×, average of 3.45×) performance improvements over well-optimized conventional designs with small area overheads (up to 19.3%, 15.1% on average).","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167588","","Circuits;Computer architecture;Costs;Data mining;Distributed computing;Global communication;Hardware;High level synthesis;Logic design;Parallel processing","circuit CAD;circuit simulation;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated memory circuits;logic partitioning;logic simulation;parallel architectures","HLS tools;RTL circuit logic synthesis/layout;area overheads;communication overheads;computation/communication geographic proximity restrictions;computing logic;data access/computation coarse/fine-grained parallelism;data-intensive high-performance designs;design trade-offs;distributed logic-memory architecture high-level synthesis;hardware resource distribution;interconnects;memories;monolithic controller/datapath memory communication;on-chip global communication cost;parallel architecture;partitioning;register-transfer level implementations;synchronization costs","","4","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pointer analysis problem has been investigated in the compiler community for two decades, which has yielded efficient, polynomial time algorithms for context-insensitive analysis. However, at the accuracy level for which hardware synthesis is desired, namely context and flow sensitive analysis, the time and space complexity of the best algorithms reported grow exponentially with program size. In this paper, we present our first step towards a new analysis technology which potentially leads to almost-linear time complexity and sub-linear space complexity algorithm even for the most accurate analysis. The key idea that contributes to this efficiency is to implicitly encode the pointer-to relation in the Boolean domain, thereby capturing the procedure transfer function completely, compactly and canonically. This represents a wide departure from the traditional techniques, all of which explicitly capture pointer-to relation using variations of point-to graph, which have to be re-evaluated for different calling contexts.

In contrast to similar recent work based on convex optimization and the positive real lemma, the methodology is potentially more efficient, since it does not introduce a quadratic number of auxiliary variables, is potentially more accurate, since pole locations can be re-adjusted during the optimization, but possibly less reliable, since it relies on the solution of optimization problems that are not convex.

Traditional methods suffer from two common issues. First, noise that is propagated through the driver of a net is combined with noise injected by capacitively coupled aggressor nets using linear summation. Since this ignores the non-linear behavior of the driver gate the noise that develops on a net can be significantly underestimated. We therefore propose a new linear model that accurately combines propagated and injected noise on a net and which maintains the efficiency of linear simulation. After the propagated and injected noise are correctly combined on a victim net, it is necessary to determine if the noise can result in a functional failure. This is the second issue that we discuss in this paper. Traditionally, noise failure criteria have been based on unity gain points of the DC or AC transfer curves. However, we will show that for digital designs, these approaches can result in a pessimistic analysis in some cases, while in other cases, they allow circuit operation that is extremely close to regions that are unstable and do not allow sufficient margin for error in the analysis. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of the discussed noise failure criteria and also present a propagation based method, which is intended to overcome these drawbacks.

With this stage it is possible to use global routing information to efficiently address these problems and to aid the detailed router in achieving the wiring completions. In this paper we formulate routing as a three stage process; global routing, track assignment and detailed routing. We describe the intermediate track assignment problem and suggest an efficient heuristic for its solution. We introduce cost metrics to model basic effects arising from connectivity. We discuss extensions to include signal integrity and process constraints. We propose a heuristic based on weighted bipartite matching as a core routine.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth work that studies the RLC crosstalk budgeting problem.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167579","","Constraint optimization;Crosstalk;Engineering profession;Helium;Linear programming;Optimization methods;Routing;Runtime;Very large scale integration;Wires","RLC circuits;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;crosstalk;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit modelling;linear programming;network routing","LP based method;RLC crosstalk bound partitioning;RLC crosstalk bounds;full-chip level methods;interconnects;layout optimization methods;linear programming formulation;net ordering;post-global routing RLC crosstalk budgeting;routing area;routing region;runtime;shield insertion","","0","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The techniques introduced are called dynamic decision ordering, conflict driven recursive learning and conflict learning. An important feature shared by all these techniques is that they are triggered by the occurrence of a conflict in the generation of tests. Hence, they are not active all the time nor for all the faults. This feature allows the ATPG system that uses these techniques to resolve hard-to-resolve faults with far fewer backtracks and leaves the system as efficient as before in the absence of conflicts. We have incorporated these techniques into a commercial D-algorithm based ATPG tool.

The MMM technique simultaneously matches the moments at several nodes of a circuit using explicit moment matching around s=0. As compared to the well-known single-point moment matching (SMM) techniques (such as AWE), MMM has several advantages. First, the number of moments required by MMM is significantly lower than SMM for a reduced order model of the same accuracy, which directly translates into computational efficiency. This higher computational efficiency of MMM as compared to SMM increases with the number of inputs to the circuit. Second, MMM has much better numerical stability as compared to SMM. This characteristic allows MMM to calculate an arbitrarily high order approximation of a linear system, achieving the required accuracy for systems with complex responses. Finally, MMM is highly suitable for parallel processing techniques especially for higher order approximations while SMM has to calculate the moments sequentially and cannot be adapted to parallel processing techniques.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167618","","Circuit simulation;Computational efficiency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Linear approximation;Linear circuits;Linear systems;Numerical stability;Parallel processing;Reduced order systems;Transfer functions","RLC circuits;SPICE;circuit CAD;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;linear network analysis;method of moments;numerical stability;parallel processing;reduced order systems;transfer functions","AWE;MMM computational efficiency;MMM numerical stability;RLC circuits;SMM;SPICE;explicit moment matching;linear circuit simulation techniques;linear system arbitrarily high order approximations;model order reduction efficiency;multi-node moment matching;parallel processing techniques;reduced order model accuracy;single-point moment matching techniques;system response complexity;transfer function moments","","3","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new scan chain architecture and algorithm so that the order of computation is proportional to the number of scan cells in a chip. The new architecture is a methodology change that does not require complex design-for-testability (DFT) as proposed in the previous techniques. Instead of solving linear equations, the proposed new seed computation algorithm topologically determines seeds for test vectors. The compression ratio might be slightly lower than the other approaches, but the proposed approach can handle larger designs in a reasonable amount of time. Computation analysis shows that, for 1 million scan cell design, if we assume it takes 1 msec for the proposed technique to compute seeds, it would take more than 14 minutes for other techniques that solve linear equations.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167516","","Circuit testing;Computer architecture;Encoding;Equations;Logic testing;Memory;Power capacitors;Shift registers;System testing;Vectors","automatic test pattern generation;boundary scan testing;circuit CAD;computational complexity;design for testability;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;logic CAD;logic testing;shift registers","DFT;chip scan cell number proportional computation;compression ratio;computation complexity;computation time;design-for-testability;linear equation system solution;scan chain architecture/algorithms;shift register reseeding fast seed computation;test pattern compression;test vector seed topological determination","","6","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our binding algorithm not only reduces power consumption in functional units and registers in the resultant register-transfer level (RTL) architecture, but also optimizes interconnects for power. We take physical design information into account for this purpose. To estimate interconnect power consumption accurately for deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies, wire coupling capacitance is taken into. consideration. We observed that there is significant spurious (i.e., unnecessary) switching activity in the interconnects and propose techniques to reduce it. Compared to interconnect-unaware power-optimized circuits, our experimental results show that interconnect power can be reduced by 53.1% on an average, while reducing overall power by an average of 26.8% with 0.5% area overhead.

We derive expressions for the moments of the victim voltage in the presence of noise. From these we compute estimates of the earliest and latest possible arrival times of the victim. We compare the analytical results with Monte Carlo simulations using SPICE. Even though the analytical calculations are 200 times faster than the Monte Carlo simulations, the differences in the estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the arrival time is no more than 2.8%. In addition, the width of the timing intervals using the proposed approach is reduced by as much as 48% with a confidence level of 0.984.

By extracting a few characteristic faults from the circuit, we show that detection of these characteristic faults is sufficient in detecting a vast majority of the remaining faults in the circuit. The small number of characteristic faults allows us to reduce the coefficients necessary for BIST. State relaxation is performed on the compacted test sequences to reduce the spectral noise further. Since we are targeting only a very small number of characteristic faults, the execution times for computing the spectra are greatly reduced.

Since noise estimation is often part of the inner-loop of optimization algorithms, very efficient closed-form solutions are needed. Previous approaches have typically used simple lumped 3-4 node circuit templates. One aggressor net is modeled at a time assuming that the coupling capacitances to all quiet aggressor nets are grounded. They also model the load from interconnect branches as a lumped capacitor and use a dominant pole approximation to solve the template circuit. While these approximations allow for very fast analysis, they result in significant underestimation of the noise. In this paper, we propose a new and more comprehensive fast noise estimation model. We use a 6 node template circuit and propose a novel reduction technique for modeling quiet aggressor nets based on the concept of coupling point admittance. We also propose a reduction method to replace tree branches with effective capacitors which models the effect of resistive shielding. Finally, we propose a new double pole approach to solve the template circuit. We tested the proposed method on noise-prone interconnects from an industrial high performance processor. Our results show a worst-case error of 7.8% and an average error of 2.7%, while allowing for very fast analysis.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167593","","Admittance;Capacitance;Capacitors;Circuit noise;Closed-form solution;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Load modeling","circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise;interference (signal);logic CAD;logic simulation;microprocessor chips;pole assignment","aggressor net coupling capacitances;coupling point admittance;crosstalk noise estimation;crosstalk noise modeling aggressor/tree reductions;dominant pole approximations;double pole template circuit solution methods;lumped capacitor interconnect branch loads;lumped/multi node circuit templates;multiple aggressor nets;optimization;physical design automation tools;processor noise-prone interconnects;resistive shielding;tree branches","","3","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then describe a method for comparing the relative merits of a set of power versus delay curves for a circuit, each generated with a different cell library. Our results indicate that very few combinational functions need to be in a cell library, at most 11.

ICCAD 2002. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20030129","2002","","","404","411","In this paper, we present a novel sequence generator based on a Markov chain model. Specifically, we formulate the problem of generating a sequence of vectors with given average input probability p, average transition density d, and spatial correlation s as a transition matrix computation problem, in which the matrix elements are subject to constraints derived from the specified statistics. We also give a practical heuristic that computes such a matrix and generates a sequence of l n-bit vectors in O(nl + n<sup>2</sup>) time. Derived from a strongly mixing Markov chain, our generator yields binary vector sequences with accurate statistics, high uniformity, and high randomness. Experimental results show that our sequence generator can cover more than 99% of the parameter space. Sequences of 2,000 48-bit vectors are generated in less than 0.05 seconds, with average deviations of the signal statistics p, d, and s equal to 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.8%, respectively. Our generator enables the detailed study of power macromodeling. Using our tool and the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, we have assessed the sensitivity of power dissipation to the three input statistics p, d, and s. Our investigation reveals that power is most sensitive to transition density, while only occasionally exhibiting high sensitivity to signal probability and spatial correlation. Our experiments also show that input signal imbalance can cause estimation errors as high as 100% in extreme cases, although errors are usually within 25%.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167565","","Circuit simulation;Computer architecture;Error analysis;Estimation error;Power dissipation;Power generation;Probability;Signal generators;Signal mapping;Statistics","Markov processes;circuit analysis computing;integrated circuit modelling;matrix algebra;probability;sequences;vectors","Markov chain model;Markov chain sequence generator;average input probability;average transition density;binary vector sequences;power macromodeling;signal probability;spatial correlation;strongly mixing Markov chain;transition matrix computation problem","","4","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel address assignment methodology that aims to minimize high energy row transitions by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of energy efficient address assignment has been formulated as a multi-way graph partitioning problem and solved with a heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology achieves row transition counts very close to the optimum and that the methodology can, for some examples, reduce row transition count by 40-70% over row major mapping.

We therefore introduce a loop cache exploration tool that analyzes a particular program's profile, rapidly explores the possible configurations, and generates the configuration with the greatest power savings.

In this paper, we address the PSO (power rail - signal wire overlap) problem which solves overlaps between power rails and signal wires due to the changes in power rail design on the top layer of a multiple layer routing region. PSO problems are frequently caused by changes in power delivery system or package design. The new routing solution satisfies the following constraints: (1) Keep the routing of power rails in the new design unchanged. (2) Only the routing of the top two layers is changed. (3) Horizontal (vertical) signal wire segments on the top layer can only move up/down (left/right). (4) For each signal wire segment, the deviation (i.e., the difference between its new position and the old one) should not exceed the user-defined allowable deviation bound.

Congestion has a significant impact on performance, yield and chip area. Although advances in placement algorithms have attempted to alleviate this problem, the inherent structure of the logic netlist has a significant impact on the mutability irrespective of the placement algorithm used. Placement algorithms find optimal assignment of locations to the logic and do not have the ability to change the netlist structure. Significant decisions regarding the circuit structure are made early in synthesis, such as during the technology independent logic optimization step. Optimizations in this step use literal count as a metric for optimization and do not adequately capture the intrinsic entanglement of the netlist. Two circuits with identical literal counts may have significantly different congestion characteristics post placement. In this paper, we motivate that a property of the network structure called adhesion can make a significant contribution to routing congestion. We then provide a metric to measure this property. We also show that adhesion, as measured by this metric, can be used in addition to literal counts to estimate and optimize post routing congestion early in the design flow.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167586","","Adhesives;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Logic devices;Network synthesis;Routing;Wiring","VLSI;circuit CAD;circuit complexity;circuit optimisation;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;logic CAD;logic simulation","VLSI chip routability/wiring congestion;chip complexity;congestion dependent performance/yield/chip area;literal count metrics;logic location optimal assignment;logic netlist structure;netlist entanglement;network structure adhesion properties;placement algorithms;post placement congestion characteristics;structural logic synthesis metrics;technology independent logic optimization steps","","12","2","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More precisely, the required decoding time for each frame is separated into two parts: a frame-dependent (FD) part and a frame-independent (FI) part. The FD part varies greatly according to the type the incoming frame whereas the FI part remains constant regardless of the frame type. In the DVFS scheme presented in this paper the FI part is used to compensate for the prediction error that may occur during the FD part such that a significant amount of energy can be saved while meeting the frame rate requirement.

Traditional approaches use a single continuous switching window for a net. Under this model, signal switching is assumed to happen any time within the window. Although conservative and sound, this model can result in too much pessimism since in reality the exact timing of signal switching is determined by a path delay up to the net, i.e. the underlying circuit structure does not always allow signal switching at arbitrary time within the continuous switching window. To address this inherent inaccuracy of the continuous switching window, we propose a refinement of the traditional approaches, where signal switching is characterized by a set of discontinuous switching windows instead of a single continuous window. Each continuous switching window is divided into multiple windows, called time slots, and the signal switching activity of each slot is analyzed separately to calculate the maximum noise with more accuracy. By controlling the size of a time slot we can trade off accuracy and runtime, which makes this approach highly scalable. We have confirmed by experiments on industrial circuits that up to 90% of the noise violations detected by the traditional approach can be unreal.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167591","","Acoustic noise;Capacitance;Circuit noise;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Rivers;Signal analysis;Switches;Switching circuits;Timing","circuit CAD;crosstalk;delays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;timing","continuous switching window;crosstalk noise calculation;discontinuous switching windows;exact timing;noise sources;noise violations;path delay;signal switching;switching window;time slots","","11","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, the battery-aware dynamic power management problem is formulated as a policy optimization problem and solved exactly by using a linear programming approach.

The recent emergence of extensible processors promises a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility, while keeping design turnaround times short. Current extensible processor design flows automate several tedious tasks, but typically require designers to manually select the parts of the program that are to be implemented as custom instructions. In this work, we describe an automatic methodology to select custom instructions to augment an extensible processor, in order to maximize its efficiency for a given application program. We demonstrate that the number of custom instruction candidates grows rapidly with program size, leading to a large design space, and that the quality (speedup) of custom instructions varies significantly across this space, motivating the need for the proposed flow. Our methodology features cost functions to guide the custom instruction selection process, as well as static and dynamic pruning techniques to eliminate inferior parts of the design space from consideration. Further, we employ a two-stage process, wherein a limited number of promising instruction candidates are first selected, and then evaluated in more detail through cycle-accurate instruction set simulation and synthesis of the corresponding hardware, to identify the custom instruction combinations that result in the highest program speedup or maximize speedup under a given area constraint. We have evaluated the proposed techniques using a state-of-the-art extensible processor platform, in the context of a commercial design flow.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167600","","Art;Computer bugs;Costs;Digital signal processing;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;National electric code;Process design;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;circuit CAD;embedded systems;graph theory;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;microprocessor chips","automatic methodology;cost functions;custom instruction selection process;custom processor synthesis;cycle-accurate instruction set simulation;design space;dynamic pruning techniques;embedded system design;extensible platforms;extensible processor design flows;low power ASIP design;static pruning techniques;two-stage process","","32","4","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that verifying adaptability and synthesizing an appropriate converter are two faces of the same coin: adaptability can be formalized and solved using a game-theoretic framework and then the converter can be synthesized as a strategy that always wins the game.

However, there has been no easy way of optimizing (1) and (2) simultaneously at an early stage of the synthesis process. In this paper, we propose a new (onchip) bus synthesis algorithm to minimize the total sum of (1) and (2) in the microarchitecture synthesis. Specifically, unlike the previous approaches in which (1) and (2) are minimized sequentially without any interaction between them, or only one of them is minimized, we, given a scheduled dataflow graph to be synthesized, minimize (1) and (2) simultaneously by formulating and solving the two important issues in an integrated fashion: binding data transfers to buses and determining a (physical) order of signal lines in each bus, both of which are the most critical factors that affect the results of (1) and (2). Experimental results on a number of benchmark problems show that the proposed integrated low-power bus synthesis algorithm reduces power consumption by 24.8%, 40.3% and 18.1% on average over those in (J.

Although these methods demonstrate impressive accuracy compared to other delay metrics, their implementations tend to be challenging. As an alternative to matching to the gamma distribution, we propose to match the first two circuit moments to a Weibull distribution. The result is a new delay metric called Weibull based Delay (WED). The primary advantages of WED over PRIMO and H-gamma are its efficiency and ease of implementation.

This rate of growth has been controlled mainly by the increasing capabilities of lithographic patterning. However, the rate of improvement of lithography systems in key physical parameters such as illumination wavelength has begun to slow. To make up the shortfall, lithography has increasingly turned to using CAD tools to transform the geometric shapes in designs into shapes on photomasks which have been compensated for systematic pattern-distorting effects. As the requirements for this compensation grow, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to hide in post-tapeout data preparation, and must be considered in back-end design tools and methodologies. We describe a number of the challenges to lithographic patterning, highlighting the factors that limit ""physical scaling"" and introduce the layout-to-mask shape transformations that compensate for these limitations. We describe the implementation of these transformations in general-purpose and specialized CAD tools, pointing out challenges like growth of computation effort. Finally, we describe how limitations of post-tapeout compensation drive the need for ""litho-aware"" physical design tools, showing examples in cell design, place-and-route, and layout migration.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167568","","Computer aided manufacturing;Design automation;Fabrication;Integrated circuit layout;Optical distortion;Optical materials;Productivity;Semiconductor materials;Shape;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;compensation;design for manufacture;integrated circuit layout;masks;photolithography","CAD tools;CMOS scaling;VLSI technology;back-end design tools;cell design;illumination wavelength;layout migration;layout-to-mask shape transformations;lithographic patterning;pattern-distorting effects;photomasks;physical scaling;place-and-route;post-tapeout compensation;post-tapeout data preparation","","1","2","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, in todays low-power, high-accuracy and/or very high-speed demands for A-to-D converters, designers are often forced to resort to the use of CT ΔΣ topologies. In this paper, we present a method for the high-level simulation of continuous-time ΔΣ modulators that is based on behavioral models and which exhibits the best trade-off between accuracy, speed and extensibility compared to other possible techniques that are reviewed briefly in this work. A user-friendly tool, implementing this methodology, is then presented.

In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing critical path selection, under both fixed delay and statistical delay assumptions. With a novel problem formulation and new theoretical results, we prove that the problem in both cases are computationally intractable. We then discuss practical heuristics and their theoretical performance bounds, and demonstrate that among all heuristics under consideration, only one is theoretically feasible.

For a uniform width metal interconnect, the current flows through the driving point is much larger than that flows through the fan-out point since much of current bypasses to the ground through the parasitic capacitance. This causes the lifetime of the driving point to be significantly shorter than that of the fanout point due to electromigration. In order to avoid breakdown at the driving point, wire sizing is an effective solution. Thus we present a wire shape, of which the current density as well as the lifetime is uniform along the wire. SPICE simulation results show the uniformity of current density of this wire shape. Under the same current density bound, we demonstrate that chip area and power consumption are significantly reduced for this wire shape compared to the uniform width wire. The wire shape functions we derived are continuous. However, it is not necessary to ultra-accurately reproduce the continuous shape on the silicon, since we can round the continuous shape to the nearest available litho width and this will not degrade the uniformity of current density.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167543","","Current density;Electric breakdown;Electromigration;Energy consumption;Parasitic capacitance;SPICE;Shape;Signal design;Very large scale integration;Wire","VLSI;capacitance;current density;electromigration;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit reliability","VLSI technology;chip area reduction;current density bound;current density uniformity;electromigration problem;high-performance IC design;interconnect shaping;lifetime uniformity;power consumption reduction;power network;signal interconnects;uniform current density;wire shape function;wire sizing","","0","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we transform the generalized semi-Markov process, corresponding to the initial problem, into a continuous Markov chain (CTMC) which, however, is extremely large and, hence, most often is impossible to store in memory. We have elaborated a solution which allows us to generate and analyze the CTMC in an efficient way, such that only a small part has to be stored at a given time.

The STA tools compute setup (hold) timing slack based on conservative combinations of late (early) launching and early (late) capturing arrival times. To avoid exponential-time path-based analysis the STA tools use both early and late arrival times on gates common to both launching and capturing paths. It is impossible in a real circuit and is observed as the clock network pessimism in STA. Our approach supports any kind of delay variation though the typical causes of the pessimism are process, voltage, and temperature on-chip variation, and reconvergence in clock network. We propose a new theoretical framework that allows one to apply known graph algorithms instead of time consuming forward and backward multi-pass tracing algorithms and heuristics that are limited to some network topologies.

The most distinct feature of this approach is that it does not follow the traditional ""estimate-then-eliminate"" strategy. Instead, it avoids the excessive usage of routing resources by ""local"" nets, so that more routing resources are available for the uncertain ""global"" nets. The experimental results show that our new technique, SPARSE, achieves better routability than the traditional total wire length (bounding box) guided placers, which had been shown to deliver the best routability results among the placers optimizing different cost functions.

We propose a new approach, Waveform-based Timing Analysis (WTA) that employs a state-of-the-art circuit simulator as the underlying delay modeler.

In addition, new models of the magnetic couplings in terms of susceptance (inverse of inductance) have shown great promise for robust sparsification of otherwise intractable inductance coupling-matrix problems. However, model order reduction via PRIMA for circuits that include susceptance elements does not guarantee passivity. Moreover, susceptance elements are incompatible with the path tracing algorithms that provide the fundamental runtime efficiency of RICE. In this paper, a novel MOR algorithm, SMOR, is proposed as an extension of ENOR which exploits the matrix properties of susceptance-based circuits for runtime efficiency, and provides for a numerically stable, provably passive MOR using a new orthonormalization strategy.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167617","","Circuit simulation;Coupling circuits;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Magnetic susceptibility;RLC circuits;Robustness;Runtime;Sparse matrices;Symmetric matrices","circuit CAD;circuit simulation;coupled circuits;electric admittance;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;reduced order systems","ENOR;IC/packaging magnetic coupling modeling;PRIMA;RICE runtime efficiency;SMOR numerical stability;large RLC system VHF behavior;orthonormalization strategies;passive MOR methods;passive reduced-order interconnect macromodeling algorithm;passivity;path tracing algorithms;robust passive model order reduction;susceptance element circuits;susceptance-based circuit matrix properties","","10","1","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the calculation and storing of don't care information is CPU and memory-intensive. In this paper, we give an overview of logic synthesis approaches based on techniques developed for Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG). Instead of calculating and storing don't cares explicitly, ATPG-based logic synthesis techniques calculate the flexibility implicitly. Low CPU and memory usage make those techniques applicable for practical industrial circuits. Also, the basic ATPG-based logic level operations create predictable, small layout perturbations, making an ideal foundation for efficient physical synthesis. Theoretical results show that an efficient, yet simple add-a-wire-and-remove-a-wire operation covers all possible complex logic transformations.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167621","","Automatic test pattern generation;Boolean functions;Central Processing Unit;Circuit synthesis;Circuit testing;Data structures;Integrated circuit synthesis;Logic design;Logic testing;Network synthesis","automatic test pattern generation;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;redundancy;timing","ATPG-based logic synthesis;Boolean networks;IC design;add-a-wire-and-remove-a-wire operation;complex logic transformations;gate-level Boolean networks;literal minimization;physical synthesis;power optimization;redundancy-addition-and-removal;timing optimization","","1","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, accurately modeling the properties of the substrate as a noise-propagator is becoming ever more important. A model can be obtained through the finite element method (FEM) or the boundary element method (BEM). The FEM performs a full 3D discretization of the substrate, which makes this method very accurate and flexible but also slow. The BEM only discretizes the contact areas on the boundary of the substrate, which makes it less flexible, but significantly faster. A combination between BEM and FEM can be efficient when we need flexibility and speed at the same time. This paper briefly describes the BEM and the FEM and their combination, but mainly concentrates on the theoretical validation of the combined method and the experimental verification through implementation in the SPACE layout to circuit extractor and comparison with commercial BEM and FEM tools.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167507","","Boundary element methods;Circuit noise;Circuit optimization;Circuits and systems;Convergence;Doping;Finite element methods;Fluctuations;Noise figure;Semiconductor process modeling","boundary-elements methods;circuit layout CAD;computational complexity;electric resistance;finite element analysis;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise","3D substrate discretization;BEM tools;FEM tools;SPACE layout to circuit extractor;analog part functionality;boundary contact areas discretization;boundary element method;combined BEM/FEM substrate resistance modeling;digital part substrate noise;finite element method;mixed-signal designs;model flexibility;model speed;noise-propagator;substrate modeling","","3","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the critical techniques employed in these solvers is Conflict Driven Learning. In this paper, we adapt conflict driven learning for application in a QBF setting. We show that conflict driven learning can be regarded as a resolution process on the clauses. We prove that under certain conditions, tautology clauses obtained from resolution in QBF also obey the rules for implication and conflicts of regular (non-tautology) clauses; and therefore they can be treated as regular clauses and used in future search.

Based on an analysis of the effects of these two transforms on the delay and leakage, we justify a two-step procedure for performing this optimization.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20030129","2002","","","44","50","We propose in this paper a novel framework for multilevel routing considering both routability and performance. The two-stage multilevel framework consists of coarsening followed by uncoarsening. Unlike the previous multilevel routing, we integrate global routing, detailed routing, and resource estimation together at each level of the framework, leading to more accurate routing resource estimation during coarsening and thus facilitating the solution refinement during uncoarsening. Furthermore, the exact routing information obtained at each level makes our framework more flexible in dealing with various routing objectives (such as crosstalk, power, etc). Experimental results show that our approach obtains significantly better routing solutions than previous works. For example, for a set of 11 commonly used benchmark circuits, our approach achieves 100% routing completion for all circuits while the previous multilevel routing, the three-level routing, and the hierarchical routing can complete routing for only 3, 0, and 3 circuits, respectively. In particular, the number of routing layers used by our router is even smaller. We also have performed experiments on timing-driven routing. The results are also very promising.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167512","","Circuits;Costs;Crosstalk;Integer linear programming;Nonhomogeneous media;Partitioning algorithms;Routing;Scalability;Tiles;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit simulation;crosstalk;integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;parameter estimation;timing","benchmark circuits;coarsening;crosstalk;detailed routing;global routing;hierarchical routing;level routing information;multilevel routing framework;routability;routing completion;routing layers;routing resource estimation;three-level routing;timing-driven routing;two-stage framework;uncoarsening","","26","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20030129","2002","","","317","324","In this paper we present a method for the design of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This method computes the sizes of the different components (transistors, capacitors, etc.) in a predefined ADC topology so that the design specifications are met in the desired process technology. The method is based on formulating the ADC design constraints such as specifications on power, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), area, and sampling frequency in special convex form in terms of the component sizes of the ADC and intermediate design variables. More specifically, we cast the problem of sizing the components of the ADC as a geometric program. Therefore, all design constraints are formulated as polynomial inequality or monomial equality constraints. Very efficient numerical algorithms are then used to solve the resulting geometric program and to compute the component sizes of an ADC that meets the desired specifications. The synthesis method is fast, and determines the globally optimal design; in particular the final solution is completely independent of the starting point (which can even be infeasible), and infeasible specifications are unambiguously detected. This paper introduces the concept of hierarchical problem formulation within a geometric programming framework. This modular formulation allows a high re-use of the ADC polynomial model.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167553","","Analog-digital conversion;Capacitors;Design methodology;Frequency;Pipelines;Polynomials;Signal design;Signal sampling;Signal to noise ratio;Topology","analogue-digital conversion;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;geometric programming;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit noise;network topology;pipeline processing;polynomials;signal sampling","ADC component sizes;ADC design constraints;ADC polynomial model;ADC topology;area specifications;capacitors;component sizes;design specifications;geometric programming;geometric programming framework;globally optimal design;hierarchical problem formulation;infeasible specifications;intermediate design variables;modular formulation;monomial equality constraints;numerical algorithms;pipeline analog-to-digital converter design;polynomial inequality constraints;power specifications;process technology;sampling frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;transistors","","26","","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the granularity of units to which voltage scaling is applied, the DVS problem can be divided into two subproblems: (i) inter-task DVS problem; and (ii) intra-task DVS problem. A lot of effective DVS techniques have addressed either one of the two subproblems, but none of them have attempted to solve both simultaneously, which is mainly due to an excessive computation complexity to solve it optimally. This work addresses this core issue, that is, Can the combined problem be solved effectively and efficiently? More specifically, our work shows, for a set of inter-dependent tasks, that the combined DVS problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. Experimental results indicate that the proposed integrated DVS technique is able to reduce energy consumption by 10.6% on average over the results by (Zhang et al., 2002 and Seo et al., 2004) (i.e., a straightforward combination of two optimal inter- and intra task DVS techniques).","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560110","","Circuits;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Frequency;Minimization;Polynomials;Real time systems;Timing;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","computation complexity;energy consumption reduction;energy minimization;hard real-time application;inter-task dynamic voltage scaling;intra-task dynamic voltage scaling;optimal integration;polynomial time","","3","","12","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For todays nanometer IC technologies, process variations have a significant impact on circuit performance. The variability can change the criticality of long paths (Gattiker et al., 2002). Therefore, statistical approaches should be incorporated in critical path analysis. In this paper, we present two novel techniques that can efficiently evaluate path criticality under statistical non-linear delay models. They are integrated into a block-based statistical timing tool with the capability of handling arbitrary correlations from manufacturing process dependence and also path sharing. Experiments on ISCAS85 benchmarks as well as industrial circuits prove both accuracy and efficiency of these techniques.","","0-7803-9254-X","","10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560156","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Circuit testing;Design optimization;Integrated circuit interconnections;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing processes;Propagation delay;Statistical analysis;Timing","VLSI;critical path analysis;delay estimation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit technology;nanoelectronics;network analysis;statistical analysis","block-based statistical timing tool;circuit performance;nanometer IC technology;process variations;statistical critical path analysis;statistical nonlinear delay model;timing verification","","7","","9","","","6-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","852","859","Boolean satisfiability (SAT) has seen many successful applications in various fields, such as electronic design automation (EDA) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, in some cases it may be required/preferable to use variations of the general SAT problem. In this paper we consider one important variation, the minimum-cost satisfiability problem (MinCostSAT). MinCostSAT is a SAT problem which minimizes the cost of the satisfying assignment. MinCostSAT has various applications, e.g. automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), FPGA routing, AI planning, etc. This problem has been tackled before - first by covering algorithms, e.g. scherzo (Coudert, 1996), and more recently by SAT based algorithms, e.g. bsolo (Manquinho and Marques-Silva, 2002). However the SAT algorithms they are based on are not the current generation of highly efficient solvers. The solvers in this generation, e.g. Chaff (Moskewicz et al., 2001), MiniSat (Een and Sorensson, 2006) etc., incorporate several new advances, e.g. two literal watching based Boolean Constraint Propagation, that have delivered order of magnitude speedups. We first point out the challenges in using this class of solvers for the MinCostSAT problem and then present techniques to overcome these challenges. The resulting solver MinCostChaff shows order of magnitude improvement over several current best known branch-and-bound solvers for a large class of problems, ranging from minimum test pattern generation, bounded model checking in EDA to graph coloring and planning in AI","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110137","Boolean Satisfiability;Branch-and-Bound;MinCostSAT","Artificial intelligence;Automatic test pattern generation;Business continuity;Costs;Counting circuits;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Permission;Test pattern generators","computability;constraint handling;tree searching","Boolean constraint propagation;Boolean satisfiability;SAT based branch-and-bound search;minimum-cost satisfiability problem","","4","2","21","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","472","479","We present global routing optimization methods which are not based on rip-up and re-route framework. In particular, the routing optimization is based on trunk decomposition (D. Jariwala and J. Lillis, 2004) of the global routing. In this framework, the route of a net is decomposed into sets of wiring segments. By viewing a wiring segment as an ""atomic object"" of perturbation, we can efficiently evaluate the effect of routing tree perturbation. We propose two complementary routing optimization methods, namely segment partitioning and segment migration. These targeted optimizers can improve congestion related routing objectives by quickly shuffling wiring segments across different routing channels. Our routing approach produces better results compared to rip-up and re-route method based router Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al. 2002) with average total overflow reduction of more than 88% while taking only 61% of runtime required by rip up and reroute phase of Labyrinth. When applied to the output of Labyrinth, the approach, on average, reduces the total overflow by more than 97% with complete overflow elimination for four circuits, while requiring additional runtime of just 33%.
