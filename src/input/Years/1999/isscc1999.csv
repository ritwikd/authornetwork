ISSCC. 1999 IEEE International","20020806","1999","","","186","187","As more electronic systems operate at higher frequencies and bandwidths, they tend to emit more electromagnetic interference (EMI). Due to lack of shielding, portable systems such as notebook computers have come under increasing pressure to comply with strict EMI emission regulations, such as FCC and CISPR. The data bus and the clock are major EMI sources because they conduct high currents and form large loops. This paper focuses on spreading the frequency-spectra of the clock and data signals to reduce their peak EMI emissions for EM compatibility. In a similar work, noise is intentionally injected onto a VCO control voltage in a clock PLL to achieve the effect of frequency modulation. In this case, the phase of the dithered clock varies unpredictably so mixing of both dithered and non-dithered clocks within the same system is avoided. In the proposed scheme, the phase difference between two arbitrary edges is limited within half a period. Hence, it is more practical in real system applications. Since it is implemented with a delay-locked loop (DLL), there are no PLL problems such as accumulated phase error, difficulties in designing stable loop filters, or area costs.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759187","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Electromagnetic interference;Electromagnetic shielding;FCC;Frequency;Phase locked loops;Portable computers;Voltage control;Voltage-controlled oscillators","clocks;delay lock loops;electromagnetic compatibility;phase locked loops;phase modulation;spread spectrum communication;voltage-controlled oscillators","CISPR;EMI emission regulations;FCC;VCO control voltage;clock PLL;clock dithering;delay-locked loop;electromagnetic compliance;phase difference;portable systems;real system applications;spread spectrum phase modulation","","10","2","2","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most efficient technological approach for reducing power consumption is power-supply voltage (V/sub dd/) scaling. Threshold voltage (V/sub t/) must consequently be reduced to maintain speed but its lowest value is set by the maximum tolerable off-current (I/sub off/). Various SOI device architectures (fully-depleted or FD, partially or non-fully depleted or PD) are suggested and used either for high-speed or low-power applications. Emergence of CMOS/SOI technologies was not possible in the past because of the lack of a reliable SOI substrate in large quantities. SIMOX substrate quality is improved, and SOI substrates are now available using different wafer-bonding techniques. From a technology point of view, SOI is now mature enough to be used in commercial products.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759338","","Inverters;Length measurement;MOSFET circuits;Solid modeling;Solid state circuits;Voltage","digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit technology;low-power electronics;silicon-on-insulator;wafer bonding","SIMOX substrate quality;SOI technology;fully-depleted;high-performance digital systems;low-power applications;maximum tolerable off-current;nonfully depleted;portable applications;power consumption;power-supply voltage scaling;threshold voltage;wafer-bonding techniques","","8","6","8","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trimming can be used to achieve high linearity but cannot track variations over time caused by component aging or by temperature and power-supply changes. Background calibration overcomes this limitation. However, previous background-calibration methods require complicated post processing, occupy some of the range of the analog signal under conversion, or are tailored for a specific type of converter. This ADC uses a queue-based architecture for creating calibration time slots without disturbing the sampling of the input signal. The digital background calibration uses an adaptive algorithm to improve linearity. The queue-based architecture for generating the calibration time slots and the digital-background-calibration method are independent and can be used separately.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759266","","CMOS process;Calibration;Frequency;Latches;Pipelines;Power dissipation;Sampling methods;Solid state circuits","adaptive signal processing;analogue-digital conversion;calibration","12 bit;THD;adaptive algorithm;calibration time slots;component mismatches;digital-background-calibrated algorithmic ADC;linearity;queue-based architecture","","3","1","5","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 1999 IEEE International","20020806","1999","","","406","407","A fully-integrated voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) has been one of the focal points of CMOS RF design activities in recent years. As potential applications extend to higher frequencies, CMOS VCO designs have pushed from ultra-high frequency (UHF) into super-high frequency (SHF). The requirement for fully-integrated VCOs to operate with low voltage, low power and low phase noise usually leads to the use of relatively large transistors in a process where the quality factor (Q) of the resonant tank is low. As the operating frequency further increases, the designs become more difficult due to the large parasitic capacitance and poor high-frequency performance of the transistors. This circuit demonstrates a technique which makes a transistor parasitic capacitance tunable through the use of its back-gate thereby reducing or eliminating the need for a varactor. In other words, the functionalities of transconductance (gm) and variable capacitance (/spl Delta/C) are realized in the MOS transistors at the same time by utilizing (where it is possible) all the four terminals of the transistors.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759324","","Low voltage;MOSFETs;Parasitic capacitance;Phase noise;Q factor;Radio frequency;Resonance;Tunable circuits and devices;Varactors;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;Q-factor;capacitance;circuit tuning;low-power electronics;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","0.35 micron;9.8 GHz;CMOS;SHF;back-gate tuned VCO;high-frequency performance;low power circuits;parasitic capacitance;phase noise;quality factor;transconductance;variable capacitance","","24","10","3","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The frequency tuning range is often limited by low supply voltage and maximum variable capacitance available to varactors at high frequencies when on-chip inductors are used. Other frequency tuning approaches include varying current in the resonator to alter effective capacitance, or varying relative weighting between two different LC resonators.

This type of modulation, however, has difficulty in obtaining modulating accuracy and low adjacent-channel leakage power ratio (ACPR).

Nested Miller compensation (NMC) is commonly used to stabilize multiple-stage amplifiers. However, the bandwidth of an NMC amplifier is poor. Several topologies such as multi-path nested Miller compensation (MNMC) and nested Gm-C compensation (NGCC) have been proposed to enhance the bandwidth. When compared to an NMC amplifier, MNMC can increase the bandwidth by approximately a factor of two while NGCC can further improve the stability of the amplifier. Nevertheless, the bandwidth enhancement by the two topologies is not sufficient for high-speed applications especially to drive large capacitive loads, such as the error amplifier in a low-voltage low-dropout regulator in portable electronic devices. A topology called damping-factor-control frequency compensation (DFCFC) for three-stage amplifiers significantly increases the bandwidth and improves the transient response of the amplifiers.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759173","","Bandwidth;Capacitors;Circuit topology;Damping;Feedforward systems;Frequency;Regulators;Silicon compounds;Stability;Transient response","circuit stability;compensation;damping;differential amplifiers;low-power electronics;network topology;transient response;voltage regulators","bandwidth enhancement;capacitive loads;damping-factor-control frequency compensation;error amplifier;low-dropout regulator;low-power large capacitive load applications;low-voltage design;multiple-stage amplifiers;stability;three-stage amplifiers;transient response","","8","2","4","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since pixel values are available to the ADCs at all times, the number and timing of the samples as well as the number of bits obtained from each sample can be freely selected without the long readout time of APS. Typically, hundreds of nanoseconds of settling time per row are required for APS readout. In contrast, using pixel level ADC, digital data is read out at fast SRAM speeds.

Convolutional codes are one approach that have been widely employed in communication and storage systems. Decoders for convolutional codes have trellis structures and are typically decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. The speed of these decoders is limited by the well-known add-compare-select (ACS) bottleneck. In addition, previously reported decoder implementations use a radix-4 ACS block which processes two symbols per clock cycle. An alternative to convolutional codes are block codes which also have trellis structures that can be decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. Since trellises for block codes have well-defined source and destination states, bi-directional decoding which overcomes the ACS bottleneck states can be employed. Furthermore, processing eight or more symbols per clock cycle becomes practical allowing manageable system clock frequencies in high rate decoders.

Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 1999 IEEE International","20020806","1999","","","22","25","A seemingly insatiable demand for bandwidth is induced by continuing progress in silicon technology. This progress results in the ongoing emergence of computationally powerful new digital systems which, in turn, challenge the progress in technology. In this way a positive-feedback loop has come to exist, resulting in the need for handling and communicating ever more data. Exploitation of the computational power of silicon is the key to satisfying the perpetual need for more bandwidth. However, important as it may be, the computational power of silicon is mainly an intuitive notion. It stems from attempts to characterize the capabilities of a piece of silicon by the benchmark approaches commonly applied to the best-known of all silicon devices: the microprocessor. Clock speed of a microprocessor often is regarded as the decisive performance indicator for computational power and many people believe that increasing speed is the ultimate art of digital design. For this reason the clock speed of a microprocessor has become an important weapon in aggressive marketing and advertising aimed at convincing consumers to buy a particular new piece of equipment. But, is it really true that the computational power of silicon depends, above all, on the speed of the microprocessor? And if the answer here is no, where does the strength of a piece of silicon really come from? What will be the benefits for the average consumer of endless boosts of computational power and bandwidth? Will he/she not be overwhelmed by what clearly appear to be exponential developments obeying Moore's law? An attempt is made to answer some of these questions.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759071","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Frequency;Hardware;Microprocessors;Optical devices;Power dissipation;Silicon devices;Solid state circuits;Wideband","coprocessors;digital signal processing chips;hardware-software codesign;high-speed integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;microprocessor chips","DSPs;Moore's law;Si;bandwidth demand;computationally powerful digital systems;digital design;high speed;intrinsic computational power;intuitive notion;logarithmic law of usefulness;media processors;microprocessor clock speed;performance indicator;positive-feedback loop;scalable platforms;silicon technology","","22","","8","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many circuit technologies are used to enlarge the bandwidth. For example, sense amplifier data are extracted by a number of data-lines parallel to the bit-lines in some DRAMs. Even if these circuits are used, random accesses substantially degrade the bandwidth because row-address access and cycle time (tRAC) are much larger than column-address access and burst cycle time in conventionally designed DRAMs. Small tRAC is not essential in conventional graphic applications because of periodicity and locality of their memory accesses. However, the large tRAC has prevented DRAMs from being widely used as on-chip secondary caches.

The technique has enhanced the cost performance of a commercial high-end UNIX server because the number of LSI signal pins, board signal nets, and connectors have decreased by half. And the SBTL speed can improve to more than 1 Gb/s per pin by using advanced process and circuit technology. The previous high frequency interface uses source-synchronous transmission. But a transmission that is not synchronized with a system clock requires long latency time of several cycles for clock synchronization and data recognition at the receiver LSI. A large interface circuit for the clock synchronization is a disadvantage. Therefore, the SBTL technique synchronized with a system clock has been developed in this work to minimize the latency time even at a high frequency of 1.1 Gb/s per pin. Also, a high-speed signal pin count per LSI is important. Low-noise technique of an output buffer circuit and a package has been developed to get a 100 B high-speed data bus per LSI.

Despite the efforts made by many programmers to circumvent the effects of the high latency of DRAM access, memory access instructions continue to accumulate, which limits system performance. The many conditional branch/jump operations of mixed multi-media applications (e.g., MPEG-4), for example, make such attempts at circumvention almost completely impossible. In fact, both lower random access latency and larger bandwidth are actually more pressing requirements for the latest memory systems. In response to this situation, this 6.8ns random ROW access DRAM macro has 64Mb capacity and 9.1ns complete random access cycle.

This idea, reconfigurable computing, provides an attractive solution especially for media/network-centric applications. Various types of reconfiguration scenarios in such applications, however, require logic LSIs to significantly enhance reconfigurability in three respects: (1) agility-reconfiguration may need to take place in very short intervals, say within a hundred /spl mu/P instructions; (2) controllability-reconfiguration may be controlled from an external /spl mu/P or by itself; (3) flexibility-reconfiguration target may be arbitrarily positioned and irregularly shaped.

Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors along with copper interconnections offer a breakthrough for the 21st century microprocessor technology for performance, power, and cost. Microprocessor technology has been waiting for more and faster transistors with less power and lower operating voltage and more and faster interconnections with less electrical and physical shortcomings. A 0.25/spl mu/m FD-SOI4-Metal CMOS 64b Alpha microprocessor is fabricated containing 9.66 million transistors and measures 14.4x14.5mm2 at 60OMHz operating frequency under typical operating conditions with 1.5V power supply along 2.0V interface.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759342","","CMOS technology;Copper;Costs;Frequency measurement;Microprocessors;Power measurement;Power supplies;Silicon on insulator technology;Transistors;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;silicon-on-insulator","0.25 micron;1.5 V;600 MHz;64 bit;ALPHA microprocessor;FD-SOI4-Metal CMOS;gate oxides;operating frequency;operating voltage;scaling;short-channel effects","","4","","2","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The voltage-controlled oscillator reported here is to be used in a HIPERLAN transceiver. Here, the receiver employs two downconversion steps, each with a 2.6 GHz local oscillator (LO) frequency, translating the RF spectrum to dc. The second downconversion thus requires the quadrature phases of the LO.

This paper describes one such method, which is referred to as TC-E/sup 2/PRML. TC-E/sup 2/PRML is based on the idea of jointly designing the coding and the equalization functions to achieve improved utilization of the available SNR and bandwidth of the head/media combination.

For such applications, the video signal, which is a time-multiplexed signal of pixel data using scanning circuits, is a bottleneck of conventional image processing systems. The key to the realization of high speed and flexible image processing beyond the video signal rate is to remove the bottleneck of data transfer and implement general purpose functionality. In other words, a fully parallel architecture with generality of processing should be adopted instead of scanning circuits.

Therefore, it seems to be difficult to achieve Gb/s class throughput with this scheme using low-cost technology. Using a decoder with AC receivers is one solution for obtaining data-format-free operation at narrower bandwidth, but this increases power dissipation.

The PLLs used in receivers are usually required to generate a low-jitter clock, but at the same time, to achieve fast frequency and phase lock. Conventional analog PLLs can generate a low-jitter clock signal with a narrow loop bandwidth, at the expense of lengthened locking time. As an alternative, a digital PLL or a hybrid analog/digital PLL can achieve a 50-cycle lock with a 125 ps jitter from an unknown frequency. But, its inherent complexity causes problems such as a large die, low speed, and high power consumption. A sophisticated loop bandwidth control algorithm is applied such as a gear-shifting or a lock-detection algorithm to the conventional analog PLLs. Here, the PLLs dynamically control the loop bandwidth by changing the charge-pump current in real time according to a well-designed current control sequence stored in its memory. However, in many applications such as high-speed HDDs and DVDs under the influence of phase fluctuation, instant frequency shift, and varying jitter, the stored fixed sequence in its memory is not adequate. This gear-shifting PLL achieves fast locking with low jitter in a time-varying channel.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759285","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Costs;Digital communication;Energy consumption;Frequency;Hardware;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Signal generators","digital communication;jitter;phase locked loops;synchronisation","adaptive bandwidth PLL;charge-pump current;clock recovery;clock signal;digital PLL;digital communication receivers;gear-shifting algorithm;hardware cost;hybrid analog/digital PLL;locking time;low-jitter clock;time-varying channel","","13","4","2","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers.

A multi-bit DAC needs to be linear to avoid being the performance-limiting factor in a CB converter. Aside from this drawback, multi-bit quantization is attractive because it improves /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator performance by increasing the modulator resolution or increasing the modulator bandwidth, while at the same time whitening the quantization noise and improving modulator stability. Among many dynamic-matching schemes existing today, the butterfly shuffler is effective and practical. Thus far, schemes based on the butterfly shuffler are used to whiten or to 1/sup st/-order shape mismatch errors. This paper presents a model of the structure which shows how a butterfly shuffler can be endowed with ""arbitrary"" mismatch-shaping characteristics. A 2/sup nd/-order bandpass shuffler is given as an example. A 16-element switched-capacitor (SC) DAC is designed and fabricated with a 1.2 /spl mu/m double-poly CMOS process. An 8/sup th/-order bandpass /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA along with the 2/sup nd/-order bandpass shuffler to drive the DAC. The system diagram is shown. The harmonic distortion is reduced by as much as 27 dB, resulting in a dynamic range of 90 dB at 125 kHz center frequency.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759094","","Analog-digital conversion;Bandwidth;CMOS process;Field programmable gate arrays;Harmonic distortion;Multi-stage noise shaping;Quantization;Semiconductor device modeling;Shape;Stability","CMOS integrated circuits;digital-analogue conversion;harmonic distortion;modulators;quantisation (signal);sigma-delta modulation;switched capacitor networks","1.2 micron;125 kHz;Xilinx FPGA;butterfly shuffler;double-poly CMOS process;dynamic range;dynamic-matching schemes;harmonic distortion;modulator bandwidth;modulator resolution;modulator stability;multi-bit /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ switched-capacitor DAC;performance-limiting factor;single-bit quantization","","4","","4","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This must be achieved at low cost and with minimum impact on system complexity or power consumption. Reported CCDs have this level of performance. However, the inherent analog nature of CCDs leads to a requirement for driving large external loads at high frequency from the image sensor. CMOS active pixel sensors (APS) are ideal for these applications due to the possibility for on-chip signal processing (especially analog-to digital converters [ADC]) integration and inherent low power consumption. This advantage is especially important in large-format high speed imaging applications.

During a write, current is drawn through WW, while no current is drawn through WWb. This forces the differential voltage between MC and MCb to equal the voltage between WE and WBb. When the current is shifted from WW to WWb after the write is finished, the positive feedback of device QF and QFb maintains the differential voltage across MC and MCb. When the memory cell is selected during a read on read port A, current is drawn through RAW. This forces current to flow through either RAB or RABb, depending on whether MC or MCb has a higher voltage level. The sense amplifier determines through which bit line current is flowing.

Transmitting data simultaneously in both directions (full duplex) over a two wire twisted pair means that modems have to handle strong echo signals (transmit signal that comes back via receive path), while the received signal is strongly attenuated by the line itself. For transmit data in frequency division mode, transmit and receive signals can be well separated by high-order analog filtering. For overlapping bandwidths, the strong echo has to be suppressed either by an analog hybrid or digitally which requires extremely high resolution A/D converter (>15 b).

A key component of such a PON system is the burst-mode transmitter inside the optical network unit (ONCS) at the subscriber end. It must have low power consumption since it must run from a backup battery during power outages, low cost to be competitive with regard to the copper-based infrastructure, and stable over a wide temperature range because it may be located outdoors.

This ADC achieves 9.3 ENOB with an effective resolution bandwidth of 14 MHz at 16 MSample/s sample frequency. The ADC is based on a two-step architecture, which combines a high sampling rate with a limited number of comparators. This ADC operates at 3.3 V supply voltage by using a floating ladder structure, full differential dual residue signal processing with improved switching and offset-compensated residue amplifiers. Latency is kept at a minimum of 2 cycles.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759267","","Analog-digital conversion;Bandwidth;CMOS technology;Circuits;Clocks;Measurement standards;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Signal resolution;System-on-a-chip;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;clocks;comparators (circuits);compensation;sample and hold circuits","0.35 micron;10 bit;14 MHz;195 mW;3.3 V;CMOS;QAM;VSB;clock-generation circuits;comparators;effective resolution bandwidth;floating ladder structure;full differential dual residue signal processing;latency;offset-compensated residue amplifiers;sampling rate;track-and-hold circuits;two-step ADC;untrimmed ADC","","2","","2","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The QAM transceiver is a monolithic mixed signal device implemented in 0.35 /spl mu/m four-level metal single-poly CMOS. The transceiver supports 4-, 16-, 32-, 64-, 128-, and 256-QAM modulation formats and operates at symbol rates as high as 13 MBaud. The transceiver chip contains a fully-integrated transmitter, including ATM UTOPIA or synchronous input interface, packet-formatting logic, Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC) encoding, a rate-adaptive QAM modulator and a 10 b D/A converter. The receiver portion of the transceiver chip consists of a high-precision 10 b A/D converter, a programmable rate QAM demodulator, all-digital clock and carrier recovery loops, powerful adaptive filters to provide rejection of narrowband interferers and the equalization of severe channel distortions, FEC decoding, ATM UTOPIA or synchronous output interface and an analog phase-lock loop for internal clock generation from a single crystal reference. The QAM transceiver may be used in applications such as asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) services.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759223","","CMOS logic circuits;Clocks;DSL;Demodulation;Forward error correction;Logic devices;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Reed-Solomon codes;Transceivers;Transmitters","CMOS integrated circuits;Reed-Solomon codes;adaptive filters;asynchronous transfer mode;digital subscriber lines;error correction codes;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;quadrature amplitude modulation;transceivers;twisted pair cables","0.35 micron;10 bit;52 Mbit/s;ATM UTOPIA;FEC decoding;Reed-Solomon forward error correction encoding;adaptive filters;all-digital clock;analog phase-lock loop;asymmetric digital subscriber line;carrier recovery loops;data rates;four-level metal single-poly CMOS;fully-integrated transmitter;internal clock generation;mixed signal device;narrowband interferers;packet-formatting logic;programmable rate QAM demodulator;quadrature amplitude modulation;rate-adaptive QAM modulator;severe channel distortions;symbol rates;synchronous input interface;twisted-pair;universal DSL transceiver IC;very high-speed digital subscriber line","","7","","3","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 1999 IEEE International","20020806","1999","","","26","30","Ubiquitous broadband connectivity has been the ""Holy Grail"" of the telecommunications industry for decades. Broadband communications is generally defined as those services operating at data rates in excess of 1.5 Mb/s. The most common broadband service in use today is known as T-1 which operates at 1.544 Mb/s. However, due to the high cost, it is available almost exclusively to businesses. The most common residential digital telecommunications service available today is Internet access via voiceband modems. These ""narrowband"" connections are limited to maximum data rates of 56 kb/s. The principal roadblock to the widespread deployment of broadband services has been cost. While the theoretical foundations of broadband digital communications have been well-known for many decades, there has not been, until relatively recently, any practical way to implement the sophisticated signal processing algorithms necessary to build transceivers that could operate robustly over the relatively poor quality ""last-mile"" communications channels. The availability of low-cost deep-submicron CMOS technologies makes it possible to put the necessary signal processing horsepower on a single chip, and as a result is the key enabler of the entire broadband communications industry.","0193-6530","0-7803-5126-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759072","","Broadband communication;CMOS technology;Communication industry;Costs;Digital communication;Modems;Signal processing algorithms;Telecommunication services;Transceivers;Web and internet services","CMOS digital integrated circuits;broadband networks;digital communication;transceivers","1.5 Mbit/s;broadband communications ICs;broadband digital communications;data rates;deep-submicron CMOS technologies;high-bandwidth connectivity;residential digital telecommunications service;signal processing algorithms;transceivers","","13","","","","","17-17 Feb. 1999","15 Feb 1999-17 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
