"Efficient BIST hardware insertion with low test application time for synthesized data paths","Nicolici, N.; Al-Hashimi, B.M.","Sch. of Eng. & Adv. Technol., Staffordshire Univ., UK","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 1999. Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","289","295","In this paper new and efficient BIST methodology and BIST hardware insertion algorithms are presented for RTL data paths obtained from high level synthesis. The methodology is based on concurrent testing of modules with identical physical information by sharing the test pattern generators in a partial intrusion BIST environment. Furthermore, to reduce the number of signature analysis registers and test application time the same type modules are grouped in test compatibility classes and n-input k-bit comparators are used to check the results. The test application time is computed using an incremental test scheduling approach. An existing test scheduling algorithm is modified to obtain an efficient trade-off between the algorithm complexity and testable design space exploration. A cost function based on both test application time and area overhead is defined and a tabu search-based heuristic capable of exploring the solution space in a very rapid time is presented. To reduce the computational time testable design space exploration is carried our in two phases: test application time reduction phase and BIST area reduction phase. Experimental results are included confirming the efficiency of the proposed methodology.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761136","","Built-in self-test;Computer applications;Hardware;High level synthesis;Processor scheduling;Registers;Scheduling algorithm;Space exploration;Test pattern generators;Testing","built-in self test;design for testability;high level synthesis;logic testing","BIST area reduction;BIST hardware insertion;RTL data paths;algorithm complexity;application time;concurrent testing of modules;cost function;high level synthesis;incremental test scheduling;n-input k-bit comparators;partial intrusion;signature analysis registers;synthesized data paths;test application time reduction;test compatibility classes;test scheduling algorithm;testable design space exploration;trade-off","","1","","14","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","5","6","Summary form only given. The last 25 years has seen a dramatic increase in gate count and the Design for Testability techniques such as Full Scan, LSSD, BIST, etc. have been developed to cope with this. However, there is now a significant difference brought on by the technology developments facing us. The onset of deep sub-micron (now currently alluded to as Nanometer Technology) is changing the way chips are being designed and manufactured. Because of the large capacity of these new chips, plus the expense of new designs, embedded systems are setting the pace for today and the future. New problems are arising that are driving design automation to integrate all the tools that are needed to successfully take a design from concept to reality in this new design environment. Test is one part of this process that is getting significant attention. An area once classified as a “back end” process in the design flow is moving closer to the “front end”. Design methodologies are incorporating test-related structures in the beginning of the design cycle. In addition, standards to manage the test complexity of these large designs are being proposed. For example, IEEE P1500 is working towards defining a structure for embedded cores such that tests can be delivered to these cores. This alone is a strong challenge for the Test Community. It is clear that the design and testing of embedded systems is the key challenge facing the Test Community","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761089","","Automatic testing;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Costs;Design for testability;Embedded system;Logic gates;Logic testing;Sequential analysis;System testing","automatic testing;built-in self test;design for testability;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit testing;nanotechnology","BIST;DFT techniques;IEEE P1500;LSSD;automatic test generation;deep submicron ICs;design automation;design for testability;embedded core testing;embedded systems;full scan method;nanometer technologies","","1","","","","","1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"C for system level design","Arnout, G.","","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 1999. Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","384","386","Few people disagree with the fact that today about 80% of a system is software running on a “platform” of general purpose or custom processors (CPU and/or DSP) tightly coupled with unique dedicated hardware. This makes C (or C++) an obvious candidate for a system level design language. Without good hardware/software partitioning tools and support for C-based hardware design, the software content may have to increase by necessity. With the right hardware support a system team has the flexibility to make cost, performance, power trade-offs and decide later in the game how much of the system is software and how much is hardware. Another issue is legacy software and hardware. Legacy C software is well understood but legacy hardware is usually only available as RTL (Verilog or VHDL) at best. Therefore the ideal system level design language is C (or C++) based, accommodates hardware design but also co-exists with the vast legacy of Verilog and VHDL based re-usable hardware. CoWare N2C is practical solution, used in real life design around the world, that a) preserves the C software development paradigm for software people, b) adds the necessary clocking to C to enable hardware designers to move C functionality into a hardware architecture, and c) co-exists C for co-design and co-simulation) with existing hardware in Verilog or VHDL","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761151","","Clocks;Costs;Digital signal processing;Hardware design languages;Programming;Software design;Software performance;Software systems;Software tools;System-level design","C language;C++ language;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;software development management","C software development paradigm;C++;C-based hardware design;CoWare N2C;RTL;VHDL;Verilog;cost;flexibility;legacy software;legacy software and hardware;performance;power trade-off;real life design;system level design","","3","1","","","","1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is likely to become infeasible in the near future due to an aggressive drive to increased Overall Timing Accuracy (OTA), as predicted in the SIA Roadmap. In this paper, a method for Parametric Built-in Self-Test using on-chip Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) is presented which is capable of overcoming the timing accuracy problem. A PLL-based test circuitry to determine the maximum frequency is described. Design constraints of the PLL control system, such as stability and resolution, are discussed for a specific design using 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

"Scaling deeper to submicron: on-line testing to the rescue","Nicolaidis, M.; Zorian, Y.","","Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition 1999. Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","432","","Summary form only given. Progress in technological scaling allows the integration into a single chip of hundreds of millions of transistors, moving quickly to the multi-billion transistor capacities. Achieving acceptable quality and reliability levels for these complex products is one of the most critical issues that need to be faced. Testability is therefore a key factor that could limit these trends if not addressed adequately. At these levels of complexity external testing is becoming infeasible due to ATPG limitations. At the same time, the scan approach is losing interest due to the increasing length of scan chains (and thus test length), and low test application speed. At-speed test is a major limitation at a context where increasing clock frequencies (moving quickly to the multi-GHz domain), are making timing faults predominant. Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is another important limitation, since, although its very high cost, it does not offer the memory capacities/depth and test application speed required for testing present day ICs. Under these constraints, the only realistic issue is to extend the BIST practice beyond memory testing. This requires new developments on logic BIST for increasing fault coverage while containing hardware cost. Furthermore, new developments on fault modeling, fault simulation, and ATPG tools are needed to encounter for timing faults, cross talk, ground bounce and other spurious faults. These developments should be oriented towards a BIST approach.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761161","","Automatic test equipment;Automatic test pattern generation;Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Clocks;Costs;Frequency;Hardware;Logic;Timing","automatic testing;built-in self test;design for testability;digital integrated circuits;fault simulation;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;monolithic integrated circuits;radiation hardening (electronics)","ATE;ATPG limitations;ATPG tools;BIST;DFT;SEU;cross talk;fault coverage;fault modeling;fault simulation;ground bounce;online testing;single event upsets;soft error tolerant design;submicron IC testing;technological scaling;testability;timing faults","","0","3","","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately two of the most important goals in designing such a language, are at odds with each other: heterogeneity requires components of the system to be captured precisely by domain specific models to simplify analysis and synthesis; simplicity requires a consistent notation to avoid confusion. In this paper, we focus on our effort in resolving this dilemma in an extensible language called OpenJ. In contrast to the conventional monolithic languages, OpenJ has a layered structure consisting of the kernel layer which is essentially an object oriented language designed to be simple, modular and polymorphic; the open layer which exports parameterizable language constructs; the domain layer which precisely captures the computational models essential for embedded systems. The domain layer can be provided by vendors via a common protocol defined by an open layer which enables the supersetting or/and subsetting of the kernel. A compiler has been built for this language and experiments are conducted for popular models such as synchronous, discrete event and dataflow.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761169","","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer science;Electrical capacitance tomography;Embedded computing;Hip;Kernel;Process design;Read only memory;System-level design","circuit CAD;embedded systems;formal specification;integrated circuit design;object-oriented languages;program compilers;protocols;specification languages","OpenJ;compiler;computational models;dataflow model;discrete event model;domain layer;embedded systems;extensible system level design language;heterogeneity;implementation;kernel layer;layered structure;object oriented language;open layer;parameterizable language constructs;protocol;simplicity;specification;subsetting;supersetting;synchronous model;system-on-a-chip","","4","","17","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analytical derivations as well as experimental results demonstrate the importance of correct modeling of the battery-hardware system as a whole and provide a more accurate basis for comparing various low power optimization methodologies and techniques targeted toward battery-powered electronics","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761099","","Batteries;Circuit analysis;Delay;Energy dissipation;Optimization methods;Power system modeling;Semiconductor device modeling;Shape;Very large scale integration;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;VLSI;cells (electric);convertors;delay estimation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;low-power electronics","DC-DC convertor;VLSI circuit;average discharge current;battery sub-system;battery-hardware system model;battery-powered digital CMOS design;battery-powered electronics;delay;energy dissipation;energy-delay tradeoff curve;integrated model;low power optimization methodologies;operating voltage;optimum energy-delay product","","14","","15","","","1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By placing local controllers close to the datapath resources they control reduces the control wire length which in turn increases the circuit performance, especially at higher frequencies where interconnect delays are dominant.

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","4","","Abstract only given, as follows. The increasing demand for dynamically controlled safety features, driving comfort and operational convenience in upper class cars require an intensive use of ECUs (electronic control units) including software. A network of up to 70 ECUs which are communicating via buses is mandatory for the required functionality. On the one hand, complexity of ECUs is rapidly increasing and time to market is decreasing. On the other hand, automotive electronics is developed together with many suppliers under control of the OEMs. Furthermore, 30% of the value added in automotives is up to electronics. Thus, from a technical, an administrative and from a business point of view the car manufacturers have a vital interest to improve and shorten the software development process for ECUs together with all partners involved. As a consequence, a general objective is to improve the ECU development process based on standards. Besides OSEK as an already accepted standard for ECU software operating systems in Germany, the OEMs are also interested in standards for bus systems or for model exchange formats, to mention just a few. In addition, an improved ECU design process covers system analysis, system specification, system design, automatic code generation, an integration of ECUs and the corresponding software in a real environment as well as calibration and after sales services. This presentation gives an overview about the current situation in automotive electronics design, presents a new design process and discusses the challenges.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761088","","Automotive electronics;Automotive engineering;Consumer electronics;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Software safety;Software standards;Systems engineering and theory;Time to market;Vehicle safety","automotive electronics;design engineering;standards;systems analysis;systems engineering","ECU hardware architecture development;OEM;OSEK;automatic code generation;automotive electronics;bus systems;car manufacture;dynamically controlled safety features;electronic control units;model exchange formats;software development process;standards;system analysis;system design;system specification;systems engineering","","2","","","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It finds application in test pattern generation, delay-fault testing, combinational equivalence checking and circuit delay computation, among many other problems. Moreover Boolean satisfiability is in the core of algorithms for solving binate covering problems. This paper describes how Boolean satisfiability algorithms can take circuit structure into account when solving instances derived from combinational circuits. Potential advantages include smaller run times, the utilization of circuit-specific search pruning techniques, avoiding the overspecification problem that characterizes Boolean satisfiability testers, and reducing the time for iteratively generating instances of SAT from circuits. The experimental results obtained on several benchmark examples in two different problem domains display dramatic reductions in the run times of the algorithms, and provide clear evidence that computed solutions can have significantly less specified variable assignments than those obtained with common SAT algorithms.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761177","","Benchmark testing;Character generation;Circuit testing;Combinational circuits;Delay;Displays;Electronic design automation and methodology;Iterative algorithms;Pervasive computing;Test pattern generators","Boolean functions;automatic test pattern generation;circuit CAD;combinational circuits;computability;delay estimation;logic CAD;logic testing","ATPG;Boolean satisfiability;EDA;circuit-specific search pruning techniques;combinational circuits;electronic design automation;modeling tool;overspecification problem avoidance","","12","2","21","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it must necessarily be an incomplete task since it is impossible to completely exercise the specification by exhaustively applying all input patterns. The paper aims at presenting a two-step strategy based on symbolic analysis of the VHDL specification, using a behavioral fault model. First, we generate a reduced number of functional test vectors for each process of the specification which allows complete code statement coverage and bit coverage, allowing the identification of possible redundancies in the VHDL process. Then, through the definition of a controllability measure, we verify if these functional test vectors can be applied to the process inputs when interconnected to other processes. If this is not the case, the analysis of the nonapplicable inputs provides identification of possible code redundancies and design errors. Experimental results show that bit coverage provides complete statement coverage and a more detailed identification of possible design errors.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761163","","Algorithm design and analysis;Controllability;High level synthesis;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Redundancy;Software engineering;Test pattern generators;Testing","fault diagnosis;hardware description languages;logic testing;redundancy;symbol manipulation","VHDL specifications;behavioral fault model;bit coverage;code statement coverage;controllability measure;design errors;functional correctness;nonapplicable inputs;process inputs;redundancies;symbolic analysis;symbolic functional vector generation;two-step strategy","","16","","18","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent developments on self-checking operators based on parity prediction compatible schemes allow us to achieve high fault coverage and low hardware cost in self-checking data paths for the majority of basic data path blocks such as, adders, ALUs, shifters, register files, etc. However, parity prediction self-checking multipliers involve hardware overhead significantly higher than for other blocks. Thus, large multipliers will increase significantly the hardware overhead of the whole data path. Residue arithmetic codes allow to reduce this cost The tools presented in this paper generate automatically self-checking multipliers using such codes. They complete our tools using parity prediction for various other blocks, and enable automatic generation of low cost self-checking data paths.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761107","","Adders;Arithmetic;Circuit faults;Circuit noise;Costs;Design automation;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Frequency;Protection","automatic testing;built-in self test;circuit CAD;fault diagnosis;logic CAD;multiplying circuits;residue codes","CAD framework;automatic generation;data path blocks;design effort;fault coverage;hardware cost;hardware overhead;parity prediction compatible schemes;residue arithmetic codes;residue codes;self-checking multipliers","","8","","24","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, several approaches have been proposed for solving this problem. Still, the hardness of the problem and the ever-growing complexity of logic circuits motivates studying and developing alternative solutions. In this paper we study the application of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) algorithms for solving the combinational equivalence checking (CEC) problem. Although existing SAT algorithms are in general ineffective for solving CEC, in this paper we show how to improve SAT algorithms by extending and applying recursive learning techniques to the analysis of instances of SAT. This in turn provides a new alternative and competitive approach for solving CEC. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the proposed improved SAT algorithm can be useful for a large variety of instances of CEC, in particular when compared with pure BDD-based approaches.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761110","","Automatic testing;Boolean functions;Circuit testing;Combinational circuits;Delay;Electronic design automation and methodology;Electronic equipment testing;Electronics packaging;Glass;Test pattern generators","circuit complexity;combinational circuits;computability;learning (artificial intelligence);recursive functions","Boolean satisfiability algorithms;SAT algorithm;combinational circuits;combinational equivalence checking;complexity;digital circuits;logic circuits;recursive learning;verification","","15","","21","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel technique, called software bit-slicing for performing simultaneous simulation of several input vectors on a conventional uniprocessor. As with conventional vector-packing techniques, this technique is able to assign a different input vector to each bit of a word, permitting the simultaneous simulation of n vectors, where n is the number of bits in a word. The inversion algorithm is used to give an example of this technique. For this example, a 6x speedup can be realized by using software bit-slicing.

Operating on the delay critical paths of the circuit, we perform a set of controlled local retimings of registers across fanout stems and logic gates, followed by local node simplifications. We guide the retiming of registers across fanout stems to induce equivalence relations among them, which are exploited for subsequent logic simplification. Our technique is able to analyze correlation of logic across register boundaries during simplification. We strive to minimize the increase in number of registers without sacrificing the cycle-time performance.

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","105","109","This paper presents a new code optimization technique for a class of embedded processors. Modern embedded processor architectures show deep instruction pipelines and highly parallel VLIW-like instruction sets. For such architectures, any change in the control flow of a machine program due to a conditional jump may cause a significant code performance penalty. Therefore, the instruction sets of recent VLIW machines offer support for branch-free execution of conditional statements in the form of so-called conditional instructions. Whether an if-then-else statement is implemented by a conditional jump scheme or by conditional instructions has a strong impact on its worst-case execution time. However the optimal selection is difficult particularly for nested conditionals. We present a dynamic programming technique for selecting the fastest implementation for nested if-then-else statements based on estimations. The efficacy is demonstrated for a real-life VLIW DSP.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761104","","Application software;Birth disorders;Computer science;Digital signal processing;Dynamic programming;Instruction sets;Pipelines;Telecommunication control;Testing;VLIW","digital signal processing chips;dynamic programming;embedded systems;instruction sets;parallel architectures;pipeline processing","DSP;VLIW-like instruction sets;branch-free execution;code generation;code optimization technique;code performance penalty;conditional instructions;control flow;deep instruction pipelines;dynamic programming technique;embedded VLIW processors;if-then-else statement;nested conditionals;worst-case execution time","","1","","10","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a higher level shutdown technique that considers both the controller and datapath simultaneously; in particular, we partition a processor into multiple simpler mutually-exclusive communicating processors, and then shut down the inactive processors (i.e., the inactive controller/datapath pairs). Power reduction is accomplished because only one smaller processor is active at a time. In addition to power reduction, functional partitioning also provides solutions to a variety of synthesis problems and does not require the modification of the synthesis tool.

Our approach provides an efficient way of estimating estimating the global effect of local logic transformations in logic circuits. In our approach, the FIT model for the transitive fanout cells of a locally transformed subcircuit can be reused to measure the global power dissipation by varying the input probabilities of the transitive fanout cells. Local logic transformation is carried our based on compatible sets of permissible functions (CSPF).

In applications where the integrity of data is not very important, data may be changed by 3 to 5% without losing too much information. One such application is that of a binary-encoded image, in which case the human eye cannot perceive the small change. However, these small changes can significantly reduce the number of transitions on the data bus and thus the power/energy consumed. We address the following problem: given a sequence of n k-bit data words and an error-tolerance e% (i,e., at most e% of the data bits are permitted to change), select the bits to be modified so that the total number of transitions is minimized. We show that a greedy strategy is not always optimum. We propose a linear-time dynamic programming based algorithm that generates an optimum solution to this problem. The experimental results for randomly generated data with a uniform distribution indicate that by changing e% data bits, the transitions can be reduced, on average, by 4e%.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761101","","Capacitance;Humans;Laboratories;Linear programming;Logic gates;Minimization;Pipeline processing;Pixel;Switching circuits;Voltage","capacitance;dynamic programming;image coding;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","binary-encoded image;bus capacitances;bus power;chip-area;data modifications;error-tolerance;k-bit data words;linear-time dynamic programming based algorithm;uniform distribution","","1","","13","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of multiobjective optimization allows a single system synthesis run to produce multiple designs which trade off different architectural features. Integrated circuit price, power consumption, and area are optimized under hard real-time constraints. MOCSYN differs from previous work by considering problems unique to single-chip systems. It solves the problem of providing clock signals to cores composing a system-on-a-chip. It produces a bus structure which balances ease of layout with the reduction of bus contention.

For this reason, we propose formal methods to guide the complete design flow of these circuits from the highest abstraction level down to the register-transfer level with formal verification techniques that are appropriate for the corresponding level. Hence, our method is hybrid in the sense that it combines different state-of-the-art verification techniques.

In particular, we require certain constraints to be met on the feedback paths of the latches involved in the retiming process. For a general circuit, we can satisfy these constraints by fixing the location of some latches, e.g., by making them observable.

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","168","174","In this paper we address the problem of state encoding for synchronous finite state machines. The primary goal is the reduction of switching activity in the state register. At the beginning the state transition graph is transformed into an undirected graph where the edges are labeled with the state transition probabilities. Next a maximum spanning tree of the undirected graph is constructed and we formulate the state encoding problem as an embedding of the spanning tree into a Boolean hypercube of unknown dimension. At this point a modification of Prim's maximum spanning tree algorithm is presented to limit the dimension of the hypercube for area constraints. Then we propose a polynomial time embedding heuristic, which removes the restriction of previous works, where the number of state bits used for encoding of a k-state FSM was generally limited to [log/sub 2/ k]. Next a more sophisticated embedding algorithm is presented, which takes into account the state transition probabilities not covered by the spanning tree. The resulting encodings of both algorithms often exhibit a lower switching activity and power dissipation in comparison with a known heuristic for low power state encoding.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761114","","Circuit synthesis;Electronic switching systems;Encoding;Energy consumption;Hypercubes;Power dissipation;Registers;Switching circuits;Tellurium;Tree graphs","Boolean functions;circuit optimisation;finite state machines;hypercube networks;logic CAD;low-power electronics;sequential circuits;state assignment;trees (mathematics)","Boolean hypercube;Prim maximum spanning tree algorithm;area constraints;fast embedding algorithm;greedy embedding algorithm;low power circuit design;low power dissipation;maximum spanning tree;polynomial time embedding heuristic;spanning tree based state encoding;state encoding problem;state register;state transition graph;state transition probabilities;switching activity reduction;synchronous finite state machines;undirected graph;weighted connected graph","","3","","13","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","97","104","Dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems offer potential for higher performance as well as adaptability to changing system requirements at low cost. Such systems employ run-time reconfigurable hardware components such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). In this paper, we address the problem of hardware/ software co-synthesis of dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems. Our co-synthesis system, CRUSADE, takes as an input embedded system specifications in terms periodic acyclic task graphs with rate constraints and generates dynamically reconfigurable heterogeneous distributed hardware and software architecture meeting real-time constraints while minimizing the system hardware cost. We identify the group of tasks for dynamic reconfiguration of programmable devices and synthesize an efficient programming interface for reconfiguring reprogrammable devices. Real-time systems require that the execution time for tasks mapped to reprogrammable devices are managed effectively such that real-time deadlines are not exceeded. To address this, we propose a technique to effectively manage delay in reconfigurable devices. Our approach guarantees that the real-time task deadlines are always met. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first co-synthesis algorithm which targets dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems. We also show how our co-synthesis algorithm can be easily extended to consider fault-detection and fault-tolerance. Application of CRUSADE and its fault tolerance extension, CRUSADE-FT to several real-life large examples (up to 7400 tasks) from mobile communication network base station, video distribution router, a multi-media system, and synchronous optical network (SONET) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based telecom systems shows that up to 56% system cost savings can be realized","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761103","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Costs;Dynamic programming;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Programmable logic devices;Real time systems;SONET","embedded systems;fault tolerant computing;graph theory;hardware-software codesign;programmable logic devices;reconfigurable architectures","ATM;CRUSADE;complex programmable logic devices;dynamically reconfigurable systems;execution time;fault-detection;fault-tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;hardware/software co-synthesis;heterogeneous real-time distributed embedded systems;mobile communication network base station;multi-media system;periodic acyclic task graphs;rate constraints;real-time constraints;real-time deadlines;synchronous optical network;system hardware cost;video distribution router","","5","2","25","","","1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results show how the proposed model can be effectively adopted to configure the memory hierarchy and the system bus architecture from the power point of view.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761219","","Electronic switching systems;Embedded system;Encoding;Energy consumption;Frequency;Microprocessors;Power dissipation;Power generation;Power system modeling;System buses","cache storage;embedded systems;system buses;virtual storage","address buses;associativity;cache configuration;caching;data buses;embedded systems;encoding;memory hierarchy;power consumption;power dissipation;power oriented encoding techniques;system bus architecture;system-level buses","","0","","4","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These two parts serve as two steps in static noise analysis of full on-chip interconnect networks called pruning process and static analysis process.","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761200","","Capacitance;Computational efficiency;Crosstalk;Network-on-a-chip;Noise reduction;Reduced order systems;Signal processing;Transient analysis;Voltage;Wiring","crosstalk;distributed parameter networks;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit noise;transient analysis;wiring","0.25 micron;coupled RC lines;coupled noise estimation;crosstalk approximation;distributed RC interconnect model;on-chip interconnects;passive model order reduction technique;process technology;pruning process;signal speed;static analysis process;static noise analysis","","3","","8","","","9-12 March 1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","756","757","Symbolic model checking tries to reduce the state explosion problem by implicit construction of the state space. The major limiting factor is the size of the symbolic representation mostly stored in huge binary decision diagrams. A new approach to symbolic model checking of Petri nets and related models of computation is presented, outperforming the conventional one and avoiding some of its drawbacks. Our approach is based on a novel, efficient form of representation for multi-valued functions called interval decision diagram (IDD) and the corresponding image computation technique using interval mapping diagrams (IMDs). IDDs and IMDs are introduced, their properties are described, and the feasibility of the new approach is shown with some experimental results","","0-7695-0078-1","","10.1109/DATE.1999.761216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=761216","","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data structures;Explosions;Formal verification;Petri nets;Space technology;World Wide Web","Boolean functions;Petri nets;binary decision diagrams;state-space methods;symbol manipulation","Petri nets;binary decision diagrams;image computation technique;implicit construction;interval decision diagram;interval mapping diagrams;multi-valued functions;state explosion problem;state space;symbolic model checking","","3","","5","","","1999","09 Mar 1999-12 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reusability of tests is crucial for reducing total design time. This raises the problem of test knowledge transfer, physical test application and test scheduling. We present a formulation of the embedded core-based system-on-chip (SOC) test scheduling problem (ECTSP) as a network transportation problem. The problem is NP-hard and we present a O(mn(m+2n)) 2-approximation algorithm using the result of the single source unsplittable flow problem (U<sub>FP</sub>).
