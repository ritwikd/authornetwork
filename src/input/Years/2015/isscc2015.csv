As Fig. 4.6.1 shows, various applications, such as text, 2D image and motion recognition use DL due to its best-in-class recognition accuracy. There are 2 types of DL: supervised DL with labeled data and unsupervised DL with unlabeled data. With unsupervised DL, most of learning time is spent in massively iterative weight updates for a restricted Boltzmann machine [2]. For a -100MB training dataset, >100 TOP computational capability and ~40GB/s IO and SRAM data bandwidth is required. So, a 3.4GHz CPU needs >10 hours learning time with a -100K input-vector dataset and takes ~1 second for recognition, which is far from real-time processing. Thus, DL is typically done using cloud servers or high-performance GPU environments with learning-on-server capability. However, the wide use of smart portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, results in many applications which need big-data processing with machine learning, such as tagging private photos in personal devices. A high-performance and energy-efficient DL/DI (deep inference) processor is required to realize user-centric pattern recognition in portable devices.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062935","","Bandwidth;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Program processors;Scalability","Big Data;Boltzmann machines;SRAM chips;graphics processing units;image retrieval;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures","Boltzmann machine;CPU;GPU environment;IO;SRAM;big data applications;frequency 3.4 GHz;image retrieval;inference processor;input vector dataset;iterative weight update;labeled data;learning-on-server capability;machine learning;personal devices;private photos tagging;scalable deep learning processor;smart portable devices;supervised DL;tetra-parallel MIMD architecture;unlabeled data;unsupervised DL;user centric pattern recognition","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes them particularly vulnerable to aging by negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) degradation of their PMOS devices. We propose a technique to sense this aging degradation; it is an in-situ technique sensing the threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>) of PMOSs directly in bitcells, and can operate in-field, thanks to the ability to sense V, robustly across temperature and voltage variations. This technique can be foundational for several dynamic reliability management (DRM) approaches, including: 1) sensing V, values periodically (e.g., every several months) for evaluating the amount and the rate of NBTI degradation; 2) sensing V, differences between two PMOSs in a bitcell to determine their strength skew and to estimate the minimum functional voltage (V<sub>MIN</sub>) degradation; and, 3) using the skew information across bitcells to create recovery vectors, which can be used to recover the aged PMOSs and thereby rebalance the skews. Existing in-situ techniques using ring oscillators or current sensors to sense bitcell reliability and performance cannot support in-field operation, which is a critical issue for DRM since it is impractical to control environmental parameters, particularly temperature, during sensing.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063027","","Aging;Degradation;Random access memory;Registers;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","SRAM chips;electric sensing devices;integrated circuit reliability;negative bias temperature instability","DRM;NBTI degradation;PMOS devices;SRAM register file;bitcell reliability;current sensors;dynamic reliability management;in-field sensing;in-situ techniques;negative-bias temperature instability;ring oscillators;sensitive circuitry","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"16.7 A 20V 8.4W 20MHz four-phase GaN DC-DC converter with fully on-chip dual-SR bootstrapped GaN FET driver achieving 4ns constant propagation delay and 1ns switching rise time","Min Kyu Song; Lei Chen; Sankman, J.; Terry, S.; Dongsheng Ma","Univ. of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","Recently, the demand for miniaturized and fast transient response power delivery systems has been growing in high-voltage industrial electronics applications. Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs showing a superior figure of merit (R<sub>ds, ON</sub> X Q<sub>g</sub>) in comparison with silicon FETs [1] can enable both high-frequency and high-efficiency operation in these applications, thus making power converters smaller, faster and more efficient. However, the lack of GaN-compatible high-speed gate drivers is a major impediment to fully take advantage of GaN FET-based power converters. Conventional high-voltage gate drivers usually exhibit propagation delay, t<sub>delay</sub>, of up to several 10s of ns in the level shifter (LS), which becomes a critical problem as the switching frequency, f<sub>sw</sub>, reaches the 10MHz regime. Moreover, the switching slew rate (SR) of driving GaN FETs needs particular care in order to maintain efficient and reliable operation. Driving power GaN FETs with a fast SR results in large switching voltage spikes, risking breakdown of low-V<sub>gs</sub> GaN devices, while slow SR leads to long switching rise time, t<sub>R</sub>, which degrades efficiency and limits f<sub>sw</sub>. In [2], large t<sub>delay</sub> and long t<sub>R</sub> in the GaN FET driver limit its f<sub>sw</sub> to 1MHz. A design reported in [3] improves t<sub>R</sub> to 1.2ns, thereby enabling f<sub>sw</sub> up to 10MHz. However, the unregulated switching dead time, t<sub>DT</sub>, then becomes a major limitation to further reduction of t<sub>de!ay</sub>. This results in limited f<sub>sw</sub> and narrower range of V<sub>IN</sub>-V<sub>O</sub> conversion ratio. Interleaved multiphase topologies can be the most effective way to increase system f<sub>sw</sub>. However, each extra phase requires a capacitor for bootstrapped (BST) gate driving which incurs additional cost and complexity of the PCB design. Moreover, the requirements of f<sub>sw</sub> synchronization and balanced - urrent sharing for high f<sub>sw</sub> operation in multiphase implementation are challenging.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063046","","DC-DC power converters;Field effect transistors;Gallium nitride;Logic gates;Switches;Synchronization;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;III-V semiconductors;driver circuits;field effect transistors;gallium compounds;switching convertors;transient response;wide band gap semiconductors","BST gate driving;GaN;PCB design;SR;balanced current sharing;constant propagation delay;fast transient response power delivery system;four-phase GaN DC-DC converter reliability;frequency 20 MHz;high-voltage gate driver;high-voltage industrial electronics applications;onchip dualSR bootstrapped GaN FET driver;power 8.4 W;switching frequency;switching rise time;switching slew rate;switching voltage spikes;time 1 ns;time 4 ns;voltage 20 V","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is aggravated by the decrease in intrinsic transistor gain and voltage headroom in nanoscale CMOS. Developments in pipelined ADCs have taken many unique directions to address these issues. Digital calibration of nonlinearity has enabled the use of low-performance op-amps. Non-op-amp-based approaches, such as zero-crossing-based circuits (ZCBC), the pulsed bucket brigade (PBB), and the ring amplifier (RA), have also been explored. This work presents a virtual ground reference buffer approach to significantly relax key op-amp specifications including unity-gain bandwidth, noise, and open-loop gain. Since the op-amp is allowed to settle fully, calibration to remove charge-transfer error in PBB and low gain or non-settling op-amp-based circuits is unnecessary. Also the transient current and corresponding voltage drop across switches and reference buffers in the ZCBCs and in non-settling op-amp-based circuits are avoided. The circuit is also shown to achieve higher maximum operating speed than alternative methods.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063036","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Capacitors;Noise;Parasitic capacitance;Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;buffer circuits;calibration;charge exchange;electric potential;operational amplifiers;switched capacitor networks;switches","PBB;RA;ZCBC;charge-transfer error;digital calibration;intrinsic transistor gain;nanoscale CMOS technology;nonop-amp-based approach;op-amp;pulsed bucket brigade;ring amplifier;switched-capacitor pipelined ADC;unity-gain bandwidth;virtual ground reference buffer approach;voltage drop;voltage headroom;word length 12 bit;zero-crossing-based circuit","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a combination of frequencies and voltages is a challenge for the driving electronics.

Current-Steering (CS) Nyquist DACs have large BW, but their linearity drops for increasing output frequencies [1]. A separate mixer is therefore needed to generate an RF signal with high linearity. A Mixing-DAC integrates the function of the mixer and DAC together. Using a Mixing-DAC can result in different architecture trade-offs which potentially enable a reduction of the cost and power consumption, while improving the linearity at high frequencies. The state-of-the-art Mixing-DACs attain linearity by means of A2 modulation [2,3] or low sample rate [4], but this results in a limited BW and does not result in a linearity better than IMD=-71dBc.

In recent years, a SATA interface supporting only up to 600MB/S throughput has hindered the accelerating performance growth of SSDs due to the host bandwidth limit. A PCI Express (PCIe) has emerged to close the limit because it can deliver 1GB/s throughput per lane and can be scaled to multi-lane to improve bandwidth. Accordingly, the SSD performance bottleneck has moved from the host interface to the NAND flash interface. In a memory system, a die-stacking technology in a NAND flash multi-chip package (MCP) effectively increases capacity and throughput performance in terms of PCB complexities and power consumption compared to a method increasing the number of channels. However, the multi-drop bus topology on NAND interfaces severely affects I/O speed degradations due to channel reflections and inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from large capacitive loadings. The undeniable paradox between larger storage capacity and higher I/O bandwidth has become a key challenge to reach enterprise-class SSDs. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a frequency-boosting interface chip (F-Chip) to boost I/O speeds while meeting capacity requirements. A 2Tb NAND flash MCP with 1GB/s toggle DDR interface is accomplished by incorporating the F-Chip into the NAND MCP including a 16-die stacked 128Gb NAND flash.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062964","","Calibration;Clocks;Delays;Flash memories;Resistors;Temperature sensors","NAND circuits;flash memories;intersymbol interference;multichip modules;power consumption","DDR interface;NAND flash multichip package;NAND interfaces;PCI Express;SATA interface;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;die-stacking technology;frequency-boosting interface chip;intersymbol interference;multidrop bus topology;power consumption;solid-state drives;storage capacity 2 Tbit","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Downscaling trends have forced the analog semiconductor industry to move to the digital domain to maintain functionality in light of increasing short-channel effects and device mismatch. Furthermore, the main goal of the new technology is to achieve faster speed and lower cost. In leading-edge processes and design environments, conventional analog PLLs in systems-on-chip (SoCs) are being replaced by digitally operated PLLs to meet clock requirements for optimal overall system performance. While a widely used time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based digital PLL (TDC-DPLL) has a linear loop characteristic, which is simple and analogous to well-known analog PLLs, it has to overcome noise issues from TDC quantization error and phase noise from the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The in-band noise floor of a TDC-DPLL is determined by the TDC resolution. Thanks to noise shaping techniques with oversampling and a pipelined architecture, noise performance can be improved. However, significant area and power must be spent to meet noise requirements. A bang-bang-based digital PLL (BB-DPLL), as the alternative type of DPLL has advantages in terms of area and power over a TDC-DPLL. However, its non-linear operation implies a longer lock time, limit-cycle noise, and high sensitivity to DCO noise. In addition, the in-band noise floor of a BB-DPLL is dominated by the input-tracking jitter, which mainly arises from the DCO noise. This paper presents a BB-DPLL in 14nm FinFET technology, combining a feed-forward delay-locked part (FFDLP) and phase-locked part (PLP) to mitigate aforementioned weaknesses.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063028","","Clocks;Feeds;FinFETs;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","MOSFET;delta-sigma modulation;digital phase locked loops;oscillators;phase noise;power supply circuits;quantisation (signal);semiconductor industry;system-on-chip;time-digital conversion","2nd-order ΔΣ analogous bang-bang digital PLL;CMOS technology;DCO;FFDLP;FinFET technology;PLP;SoC;TDC quantization error;analog semiconductor industry;digitally-controlled oscillator;feed-forward delay-locked operations;feedforward delay locked part;frequency 32 MHz to 2000 MHz;input-tracking jitter;noise shaping;phase locked part;phase noise;phase-locked operations;power 2.06 mW;power supply;size 14 nm;sub-threshold slope;systems-on-chip;time-to-digital converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typical instrumentation consists of a pulsed laser source, a discrete detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT), time-to-digital converter (TDC) card and a FPGA or PC to assemble and compute histograms of photon time stamps. Cost and size restrict the number of channels of TCSPC hardware. Having few detection and conversion channels, the technique is limited to processing optical waveforms with low intensity, with less than one returned photon per laser pulse, to avoid pile-up distortion [4]. However, many ultra-fast optical waveforms exhibit high dynamic range in the number of photons emitted per laser pulse. Examples are signals observed at close range in ToF with multiple reflections, diffuse reflected photons in DOT or local variations in fluorescent dye concentration in microscopy. This paper provides a single integrated chip that reduces conventional TCSPC pile-up mechanisms by an order of magnitude through ultra-parallel realizations of both photon detection and time-resolving hardware. A TDC architecture is presented which combines the two step iterated TCSPC process of time-code generation, followed by memory lookup, increment and write, into one parallel direct-to-histogram conversion.

Standards between 25 and 32Gb/s are rapidly approaching maturity, and available products and IPs at these rates are iterating to push down power while extending channel-loss recovery limits. Predictably, specifications are now in early stages for extending per-lane bandwith to between 40 and 64Gb/s. Meeting these 25Gb/s+ targets, especially for long-reach applications, is stressing the capabilities of both the underlying circuitry and the communication channels, and has caused significant rethinking of the overall system and circuit architectures for these links. In particular, the debate about multi-level (PAM4) versus binary (PAM2) signaling and which path offers the best energy-efficiency/data-rate scalability has returned to the foreground. Similarly, the emergence of high-speed ADCs with sufficient resolution for link applications has driven renewed interest in DSP-based approaches, while other efforts have pushed more analog/mixed-signal link components to over 60Gb/s/lane. To further ensure low BER operations, sophisticated coding such as FEC is brought into the discussion. Even in the domain of optical communications, significant challenges related to the bandwidth capabilities of the optical devices as well as the back end processing are currently being addressed. In fact, some of the highest speed optical links are limited by the short electrical interconnect between the driver circuitry and the optical module itself. This forum presents state-of-the-art I/O techniques enabling such high line rates across both optical and electrical interfaces as well as a number of emerging standards such as 802.3bj, various flavors of CEI, and HMC (hybrid memory cube).","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063147","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Electrical engineering;Modulation;Optical fiber communication;Standards;Transceivers","Big Data;analogue-digital conversion;digital signal processing chips;error statistics;optical transceivers","BER operation;DSP-based approach;analog-signal link component;big data;binary signaling;bit rate 25 Gbit/s;communication channels;communication infrastructure;data-rate scalability;driver circuitry;energy efficiency;high-speed ADC;highest speed optical links;mixed-signal link component;optical communication;optical device;short electrical interconnect;ultra-high speed transceivers","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transfer of data between modules is accomplished by non-contact connectors. Because the connection electrodes are not exposed, there is no wear or damage and waterproofing is possible. The methods of constructing non-contact connectors include capacitive coupling, which uses flat plate electrodes [1], magnetic coupling, which uses coils [2-4], and electromagnetic coupling, which uses transmission-line couplers (TLC) [5-7]. Capacitive and magnetic coupling can be used only for narrowband communication below the resonance frequency (<;1GHz). Because impedance varies with frequency, impedance matching is not possible for digital signals that include a wide range of frequency components. For that reason, these couplers can be used for the MIPI D-PHY data rate (1Gb/s), but not for M-PHY (6Gb/s). The TLC, however, can be used for broadband communication (>6GHz). Because the impedance is constant, there is little reflection and digital communication is possible. A data transfer speed of 12Gb/s has been reported for a distance of 1mm between couplers [5].

Recently developed techniques based on passive mixers [1,3,4] addressed the first issue, with [1] notably achieving 0dBm blocker-tolerance and low-noise (Fig. 2.1.1 top left), yet they are still susceptible to reciprocal mixing (RM). Meanwhile, another recent work [2] showed a technique to cancel the RM by exploiting the symmetry of the phase noise (Fig. 2.1.1 top right). However, it is only capable of cancelling the RM caused by a moderate CW blocker (up to -10dBm), and lacks a front-end that is wideband, highly linear, and low-noise. In this work, we report a new architecture with phase- and thermal-noise cancellation to tackle the aforementioned challenges. The resulting design achieves 2dB small-signal NF and tolerates 0dBm blockers, yet incorporates no inductors even in the RF VCO. A low-cost wideband ring oscillator is integrated on-chip, and the phase-noise cancellation is capable of rejecting the RM when either a CW or a modulated blocker is present. This inductorless receiver achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art, breaking the traditional trade-off between LOGEN's power, phase noise, and cost commonly seen in all receivers.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062850","","Mixers;Noise figure;Phase noise;Radio frequency;Receivers","mixers (circuits);phase noise;software radio;voltage-controlled oscillators","CW blocker;gain compression;highly linear inductorless wideband receiver;large out-of-band blockers;low-cost wideband ring oscillator;off-chip RF filtering;passive mixers;phase-noise cancellation;reciprocal mixing;software-defined-radio;thermal-noise cancellation","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the advantages of TI structures, power consumption is increased due to the stricter matching requirements between channels; in some cases, >50% of total power is for calibration purposes. Thus, to realize high-speed and high-resolution ADCs with TI structures, it is important to alleviate the calibration burden by choosing a suitable number of power-efficient high-speed single channels. Previously reported CDAC-based 2b/cycle structures made contributions in realizing high-speed single-channel ADCs with high resolution by using additional capacitive DACs and modified switching logic. The power overhead and the complexity of the additional logic and DACs for 2b/cycle implementations have been of trivial concern for low resolution ADCs. However, as resolution increases, the complexity of such circuits becomes considerable, with power taking up a big share of the total. In this paper, a multi-step hardware-retirement (MSHR) technique, which disables low-accuracy hardware blocks of scaled sizes with the requirement relaxations from redundancies in an advancement to the reconfiguration scheme in the work of Kong et al.

In these applications, use of memory modules having multi-drop channels may be needed for time-efficient access to high-density memory data. A key design issue here is how to let interface transceivers not be affected by ISI and reflection noise generated by multi-drop channels having imperfect termination. The current-integrating decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) [1], which can cancel both high-frequency noise and post-cursor ISI simultaneously, has a limitation due to high gain-boosting and/or tap weight over-emphasis in equalizers to avoid eye closure caused by ISI-referred input pattern dependency. Duobinary signaling [2], which requires less boosting for equalizers by taking advantage of channel roll-off characteristic, is not effective in a multi-drop channel application because even a small timing or waveform variation due to high-frequency noise may cause degradation of the quality of duobinary signals. This work presents an integrating duobinary-based DFE receiver to avoid drawbacks described above and to increase the effective-data rate of multi-drop channels. A synergistic combination between the integrating equalizer and the duobinary signaling can provide advantages such as 1) lower gain-boosting for equalizers, 2) no need for precursor equalization, 3) ideally no input-pattern dependency during integration, 4) being more robust to high-frequency noise, 5) alleviated DFE critical timing, and 6) embedding DFE taps into duobinary circuits.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062986","","Decision feedback equalizers;Decoding;Noise;Receivers;Reflection;Timing","circuit noise;decision feedback equalisers;integrated memory circuits;receivers","adaptive integrating duobinary-based DFE receiver;bit rate 5.8 Gbit/s;channel roll-off characteristic;current-integrating decision-feedback equalizer;duobinary signaling;high gain-boosting;input-pattern dependency;integrating equalizer;multidrop memory interface;tap weight","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though the BGR provides a robust voltage or current reference with insensitivity to process, voltage and temperature variations that is superior to CMOS-only reference circuits, it has received little attention in ultra-low-power (ULP) sensor applications. While CMOS-only reference circuits have recently demonstrated nanowatt power consumption, BGR approaches still have two critical factors to preventing nanowatt consumption. One is that PTAT generation assumes sufficient forward bias, VD, of the PN junction to allow e<sup>VD/(n·VT)</sup> to be much larger than 1 in the temperature range of interest, where n and VT (=kT/q) represent the ideality factor and the thermal voltage, respectively. In addition, the PTAT generation requires a start-up circuit to prevent the circuit from resting at the undesirable zero-bias condition. Since the start-up circuit utilizes a resistive voltage division between power rails, it consumes non-zero DC current, which must be larger than leakage current in order to ensure stable start-up operation. These two requirements for PTAT generation limit the use of BGRs in nanowatt ULP applications.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062945","","Leakage currents;Photonic band gap;Solid state circuits;Temperature dependence;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Voltage measurement","low-power electronics;reference circuits","CTAT quantity;PTAT quantity;bandgap reference circuit;complementary-to-absolute-temperature quantity;power 29 nW;process insensitive reference;proportional-to-absolute-temperature quantity;resistive voltage division;robust current reference;robust voltage reference;silicon bandgap;temperature insensitive reference voltage","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These bandwidths can be exploited to increase data-rates of wireless communication links. Unfortunately, free-space path loss (FSPL) limits the operating distance of wireless systems at these frequencies. A 5-meter link at 120GHz has an FSPL as high as 88dB. Therefore such wireless links are feasible only with highly directive antennas. This work uses a directive channel instead. At mm-Wave frequencies, the directive channel can be a low-cost plastic fiber or hollow tube, made from PP, PS or Teflon. These directive channels will guide electromagnetic waves with low loss from TX to RX [1-4]. As such, RF communication through a plastic fiber becomes an interesting alternative and complements existing solutions like wireline copper or optical fibers. This paper presents an entire communication link that uses a continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) TX and RX. We report on 120GHz 40nm CMOS TX and RX chips, the connector solution, and the plastic channel. Data-rates up to 12.7Gb/s over 1m, transmission lengths up to 7m at 2.5Gb/s and an energy efficiency of 1.8pJ/b/m for 4m and 7.4Gb/s are achieved for the complete communication link. All these results are for a BER 10<sup>-12</sup>.

Accordingly, there has been a high demand for an ultra-low power (ULP) transceiver that reduces the power by more than an order of magnitude relative to that of existing solutions. Most of the previously reported ULP receivers (RXs) are developed as single-channel devices focusing on low power consumption while adopting a high-Q MEMS device or a crystal oscillator (XO). However, for proper utilization of the IoT, e.g., accommodating multiple sensors at the same time and place, multichannel operation is essential. There have been reports of super-regenerative and injection-locking-based FSK RXs as multichannel radios with a limited signal-to-interferer ratio (SIR), making them susceptible to the adjacent channel interferers. In the paper, a 2-tone modulation scheme that sacrifices the spectral efficiency and data-rate is adopted for in-band interference tolerance. For multichannel operation with an adequate SIR, downconversion is an optimum solution. However, the power burden of PLL-based LO generation impedes its adoption for ULP RX. This work focuses on reducing the power of LO generation blocks in the ULP OOK RX. Considering the relaxed frequency stability requirement of OOK modulation, a receiver-based FLL (RBFLL) that adopts the RX chain as a part of the FLL as a substitute to the power-hungry divider is proposed. Implemented in 65nm CMOS, a 2.4GHz multichannel ULP OOK RX with the RBFLL achieves -83dBm sensitivity at 1 Mb/s while dissipating 227μW from a 0.6V supply.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063012","","Frequency control;Frequency conversion;Frequency locked loops;Frequency shift keying;Radio frequency;Receivers;Voltage-controlled oscillators","Bluetooth;CMOS integrated circuits;Internet of Things;Zigbee;amplitude shift keying;crystal oscillators;frequency locked loops;micromechanical devices;radio transceivers","2-tone modulation;Bluetooth-LE;CMOS integrated circuit;Internet-of-Things;MEMS device;OOK modulation;PLL-based LO generation;Zigbee;crystal oscillator;current 13.1 A;frequency 2.4 GHz;injection-locking;multichannel OOK receiver;multichannel ULP OOK RX;multichannel radios;multiple sensors;power 227 muW;power dissipation;power-hungry divider;receiver-based FLL;single-channel devices;size 65 nm;ultra-low power transceiver;voltage 0.6 V;wireless transmission","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Voltage regulators used to accomplish this require a voltage headroom (including margin for tuning) and degrade total power efficiency by tens of percent.

Their performance, however, is limited by delay variation and random mismatch among delay cells, unless additional error correction or external control are applied. A time-domain successive-approximation scheme could be an option to achieve high resolution but it consumes too much power and area to generate precisely tuned delay cells. In another case, time-amplifier-based multi-step TDCs that can alleviate the requirement on the minimum unit delay of the quantization by time-difference amplification, may be an attractive option. However these tend to be power-hungry or to require additional calibration circuitries due to the inaccuracy and PVT vulnerability of the time amplifier or time register.

Such devices offer a realistic and accurate pen-based drawing experience for consumers using a battreryless, light, and pressure-sensitive pen; this is possible because the EMR system excites a passive pen via magnetic coupling and senses the pen's returning signal that contains coordinate and fine pen-pressure information.

At the heart of a sensor node is a microcontroller running code from an embedded non-volatile memory (NVM). In order to support increasing computational needs and low latency (the ability to respond quickly to an event), the microcontroller needs to run at high performance (8-16MHz) and still have low power dissipation. Since most of sensor-node applications are event driven, the nodes, when not active, go into standby mode, to reduce power dissipation. In order to minimize the total energy consumption, it is important to not only reduce active-mode power, but to also lower the power consumption in standby mode, and have the ability to switch between the modes with low latency and low transition energy. Multiple low-power microcontroller implementations have been discussed in literature. Some, such as [1,2,3], aggressively address active mode power, but have higher standby mode power and also do not support CPU state retention.

Thus, Tire-Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) have become an essential component in modern vehicles, as stipulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2006.

To be viable, solutions to these conflicting requirements must overcome the challenges of low cost and ever-shrinking package size. This paper describes one such solution with special emphasis on offset drift reduction. The system presented here discards the standard practice of electrically cancelling the quadrature error, and instead combines information derived from continuously monitoring the quadrature error together with a single-point temperature calibration to reduce offset drift.

However, given that the TI architecture needs to satisfy matching requirements between channels, the circuit complexity arising from the calibrations has often become a considerable burden. In order to reduce the number of channels in TI SAR ADCs, a flash-assisted TI (FATI) SAR structure [1] can be utilized to enhance the conversion speed of a sub-channel SAR ADC due to the multi-bit MSBs from a front-end flash ADC. In addition, because the codes from each SAR ADC embed the timing skew information of the corresponding channel, the structure can extract timing skew information in an efficient manner [2]. Despite these advantages of FATI SAR ADCs, as the required conversion rate increases, the power consumption of the front-end flash ADC becomes significant, which reduces the efficiency. In addition, if the target speed is higher than the frequency achievable by a single flash ADC, the FATI SAR ADC should be time-interleaved with multiple flash ADCs. The timing skew calibration scheme reported in [2] cannot be applied in this case. Considering these issues, this work introduces an advanced FATI SAR ADC with a folding-flash (F-flash) ADC that reduces the power burden placed upon a flash ADC. In addition, 2× time interleaving is applied in an effort to lower the conversion rate of the flash ADC (time-interleaved FATI SAR ADC). The offset and timing skew of each channel are calibrated in the background.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063127","","Calibration;Capacitors;Clocks;Latches;Power demand;Solid state circuits;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;calibration","CMOS;background offset;conversion rate;front-end flash ADC;power consumption;size 45 nm;time-interleaved FATI SAR ADC;timing-skew calibration","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"8.5 A 16nm auto-calibrating dynamically adaptive clock distribution for maximizing supply-voltage-droop tolerance across a wide operating range","Bowman, K.; Raina, S.; Bridges, T.; Yingling, D.; Hoan Nguyen; Appel, B.; Kolla, Y.; Jeong, J.; Atallah, F.; Hansquine, D.","Qualcomm, Raleigh, NC, USA","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","System-on-chip (SoC) processor cores experience high-frequency supply voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) droops when the current in the power delivery network abruptly changes in response to workload variations, thus degrading performance and energy efficiency. Previous adaptive circuit techniques aim to reduce the effects of V<sub>DD</sub> droops by sensing the V<sub>DD</sub> variation with an on-die monitor and adjusting the clock frequency (F<sub>CLK</sub>) [1-2] or by directly modulating the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock output with changes in the core V<sub>DD</sub> to implicitly adapt F<sub>CLK</sub> [3]. The adaptive response time and complex analog circuits limit the benefits of these techniques for a wide range of F<sub>CLK</sub> and V<sub>DD</sub> operating conditions. The adaptive clock distribution (ACD) [4-5] exploits the path clock-data delay compensation during a V<sub>DD</sub> droop to enable a sufficient response time to proactively adapt F<sub>CLK</sub>. Although the ACD mitigates the impact of V<sub>DD</sub> droops on performance and energy efficiency, the previous designs require extensive post-silicon tester calibration of the dynamic variation monitor (DVM) to accurately detect the onset of the V<sub>DD</sub> droop. Since SoC cores operate across a wide range of F<sub>CLK</sub>, V<sub>DD</sub>, temperature, and process conditions, the DVM requires a unique calibration for each operating point, thus resulting in prohibitively expensive test time for high-volume products. This paper describes an ACD design in a 16nm [6] test chip with an auto-calibration circuit to enable in-field, low-latency tuning of the DVM across a wide range of operating conditions to maximize the ACD benefits, while eliminating the costly overhead from tester calibration.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062971","","Calibration;Clocks;Delays;Synchronization;Temperature measurement;Time factors","analogue circuits;clock distribution networks;microprocessor chips;phase locked loops;system-on-chip","ACD;DVM;FCLK;PLL;SoC processor cores;adaptive circuit techniques;adaptive clock distribution;adaptive response time;analog circuits;clock frequency;clock-data delay;dynamic variation monitor;on-die monitor;phase-locked loop;power delivery network;size 16 nm;supply-voltage-droop tolerance;system-on-chip processor cores","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To realize 8K video cameras, 33Mpixel sensors [1-2] and a full-resolution camera system that uses three 33Mpixel sensors [3] have been reported. However, the weight of the camera with three sensors is over 40kg because the camera requires a large-format color-separation prism. To reduce the size of the camera, single-chip imaging is a promising approach, and a compact single-chip 8K camera that weighs only 2kg has already been developed using a color 33Mpixel CMOS image sensor [4]. However, a conventional single-chip camera has a lower image quality than a full-resolution camera because the total pixel count of the single-sensor camera is only one-third of that of the three-sensor camera, and pixel interpolation is required to configure a full-resolution image. In this paper, a 133Mpixel sensor that can be operated at 60fps to realize a full-resolution 8K single-chip camera is described. To achieve both high speed and suitable ADC resolution, 32-column multiplexing analog readout circuitry and 14b high-speed redundant successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs [5] are adopted.

Previous studies have sought to improve the write margin (WM)of SRAMs by (a) lowering the cell-VDD (CVDD) voltage (=VDD-ΔV<sub>cVVD</sub>) [1]-[3] (CVDD-D) at the expense of degradation in cell stability (static noise margin, SNM) for CVDD-HS cells; or (b) using negative-bitline (NBL) voltage (=VSS-V<sub>NBL</sub>) [1,4-6] for cross-point assist at the expense of increased area and power overhead due to the inclusion of pumping capacitors (C<sub>NBL</sub>). Wordline (WL) voltage under-drive (WLUD, V<sub>WL</sub>=VDD-V<sub>WLUD</sub>) is commonly used in 6T SRAMs [2-5] to improve HS/read SNM during read/write cycles; however, this tends to degrade WM and cell read current (I<sub>CELL</sub>), resulting in slower read/cycle speeds and necessitating an increase in ΔV<sub>CVDD</sub> or V<sub>NBL</sub> (C<sub>NBL</sub>). The maximum ΔV<sub>CVDD</sub> is limited by the hold SNM of CVDD-HS cells. Large C<sub>NBL</sub> results in large area and power overhead, particularly in macros with wide I/O and small amount of column-multiplexing (Y-mux). Thus, HS-SNM tradeoffs in l<sub>CELL</sub> and WM have not yet been solved for 6T cells, except by adding additional transistors (i.e., 8T to 10T).","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063052","","Degradation;High K dielectric materials;Layout;Power demand;Random access memory;Sensors;Transistors","Internet of Things;SRAM chips;flexible electronics;low-power electronics;macros","6T-SRAM;Internet of things;IoT;NBL;WLUD;dual-split-control assist scheme;intelligent wearable devices;negative-bitline;on-chip SRAM macros;pumping capacitors;read-write cycles;size 28 nm;voltage 280 mV;wordline voltage under-drive;write failure and half-select disturbance","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Serial NRZ links as high as 56Gb/s and 60Gb/s have been reported [1]. Nevertheless, as the rate increases, the constraints imposed by the channel, package, and die become more severe and do not benefit from process scaling in the same fashion that circuit design does. Reflections from impedance discontinuities in the PCB and package caused by vias and connectors introduce significant signal loss and distortions at higher frequencies. Even with an ideal channel, at every package-die interface, there is an intrinsic parasitic capacitance due to the pads and the ESD circuit amounting to at least 150fF, and a 50Ω resistor termination at both the transmit and receive ends resulting in an intrinsic pole at 23GHz or lower. In light of all these limitations, serial NRZ signaling beyond 60Gb/s appears suboptimal in terms of both power and performance. Utilizing various modulation techniques such as PAM4, one can achieve a higher spectral efficiency [2].

Fully synthesizable PLLs [1-2], designed using a pure digital design flow, have been proposed to reduce the design cost and allow easier integration. To achieve high-frequency resolution, PLLs are required to operate in fractional-N mode, in addition to integer-N mode. There are several architectures available [5-6] for realizing fractional-N operation. However, the existing topologies are not well suited for synthesis, as they require a time-to-digital converter (TDC) [3] and a digital-to-time converter (DTC) [4-5]. TDCs and DTCs are vulnerable to layout uncertainty, arising from automatic place and route (P&R), introducing linearity degradation and leading to poor in-band and out-of-band phase noise in PLLs. Injection locking is a promising technique for synthesizable PLLs. Unfortunately, it suffers from large spur caused by a periodic hard refresh, and limited fractional resolution, which is bounded to the inverse of the number of ring oscillator delay stages [6]. This paper describes a fully synthesizable fractional-N PLL with a soft injection-locking technique for smoothing switching and fine fractional resolution, and a cascading topology for suppressing the free-running oscillator phase noise over a wide loop bandwidth.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063021","","Clocks;Generators;Injection-locked oscillators;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","injection locked oscillators;phase locked loops;phase noise;time-digital conversion","DTC;TDC;cascading topology;digital-to-time converter;fine fractional resolution;fractional-N PLL;free-running oscillator;high-frequency resolution;in-band phase noise;integer-N mode;out-of-band phase noise;phase-locked loops;power 3 mW;ring oscillator delay stage;size 0.048 mm;smoothing switching;soft injection-locking technique;time-to-digital converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of deep trench capacitors can lead to SCVR implementations that simultaneously achieve high efficiency, high power density, and fast response time. For the application of granular power distribution of many-core microprocessor systems, the on-chip SCVR must maintain an output voltage above a certain minimum level U<sub>out, min</sub> in order for the microprocessor core to meet setup time requirements. Following a transient load change, the output voltage typically exhibits a droop due to parasitic inductances and resistances in the power distribution network. Therefore, the steady-state output voltage is kept high enough to ensure V<sub>OUT</sub> >V<sub>out, min</sub> at all times, thereby introducing an output voltage overhead that leads to increased system power consumption. The output voltage droop can be reduced by implementing fast regulation and a sufficient amount of on-chip decoupling capacitance. However, a large amount of on-chip decoupling capacitance is needed to significantly reduce the droop, and it becomes impractical to implement owing to the large chip area overhead required. This paper presents a feedforward control scheme that significantly reduces the output voltage droop in the presence of a large input voltage droop following a transient event. This in turn reduces the required output voltage overhead and may lead to significant overall system power savings.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063076","","Capacitors;Feedforward neural networks;Gears;Power generation;System-on-chip;Temperature measurement;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;microprocessor chips;power consumption;silicon-on-insulator;switched capacitor networks;voltage regulators","SOI CMOS;Si;deep trench capacitors;feedforward control;granular power distribution;many-core microprocessor systems;monolithic integration;on-chip switched-capacitor;parasitic inductances;power 10 W;power consumption;power distribution network;size 32 nm;voltage regulator","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, negative DC-biasing of the MRMs is necessary to maintain reverse-biased depletion-mode operation.

Consequently, there is a growing need for an area-efficient and simple controller design for DC-DC converters. A simple hysteretic control without any additional component for compensation is a very attractive solution because it is not only cost-effective, but also immediately responds to load change. However, a conventional current-mode hysteretic controller with low-ESR output capacitor, shown in Fig. 12.1.1, has an inherent trade-off between transient response and RC network time constant for emulating inductor current [1]. For instance, at a switching frequency less than several MHz, which is widely used in industry, the RC network occupies a relatively large die area because the capacitance C<sub>SEN</sub> of the network can be up to 100pF at a switching frequency of 1 MHz. Another issue with the hysteretic converter is its variable switching frequency, which leads to difficulty in designing an EMI filter [2]. To overcome these limitations, several state-of-the-art hysteretic converters have been reported that provide fast transient response and fixed switching frequency [2-5]. However, they suffer from noise due to the differentiator for amplifying ripple voltage [2], or need a large external or internal capacitor [3, 4], or generate high switching loss in the converter [5]. In this paper, we present an area-efficient quasi-current-mode hysteretic buck converter with fixed switching frequency. By employing a quasi inductor current emulator (QICE) with reset operation, the controller only uses a total internal capacitance of 3pF and provides fast transient response.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063002","","Capacitors;DC-DC power converters;Frequency measurement;Inductors;Switching frequency;Transient analysis;Transient response","BIMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;electric current control;hysteresis","BCDMOS;QICE;RC network time constant;current-mode hysteretic controller;hysteretic control;hysteretic converter;inductor current;low-ESR output capacitor;power-management IC;quasi inductor current emulator;quasicurrent-mode hysteretic buck DC-DC converter;reset operation;ripple voltage;switching frequency;switching loss;transient response","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the digital behavior of SPADs, pixels using signal processing in the digital domain suffer from very low fill-factor (FF), on the order of 1% [1]. Alternatively, analog counting enables compact electronics with 20.8% FF and down to 1.1ns time gating capability in 2D arrays [2] or 530ps in test structures [3]. Smaller technology nodes allow up to 26.8% FF, but high non-uniformity reduces the dynamic range and makes extensive external processing necessary [4]. Architectures with large off-pixel circuitry have been investigated [5] but demand high processing power and suffer from poor scalability. Time-resolved scientific imaging like FLIM requires fast time-domain processing of low-rate events, with high FF and repeated measurements. This paper presents a single-photon imager having 7T + 1MOSCAP per-pixel with photon counting and 750ps minimum time gating.

The processor has 5.56B transistors on a 31.9mm×20.8mm die in Intel's high-K metal-gate tri-gate 22nm CMOS technology with 11 metal layers and achieves a 33% performance boost, on average, over previous generations.

Key architectural innovations include the addition of AVX2 technology, DDR4, and fully integrated voltage regulators (FIVR) that enable per-core p-states and uncore frequency scaling. Motherboard power delivery for high-performance microprocessors has become a significant design challenge that threatens the ability to cost effectively deliver high dynamic power at low voltage. To address this challenge, a fully integrated voltage regulator solution (FIVR) has been implemented, which enables several power-performance and platform optimizations. With FIVR, power is delivered to the die from a single mother-board voltage regulator (MBVR) at an elevated voltage of 1.8V, which results in a square-law reduction in power losses in the platform. FIVRs have a wide input voltage range of ±~200mV which simplifies the design of the platform delivery network and enables higher MBVR efficiencies. FIVR delivers cost reductions by reducing the number of MBVRs and the total number of VR phases required. The socket and package also require fewer power pins. The result is that total platform power is lower in the FIVR design, when compared to a classic MBVR solution at iso performance and cost.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062934","","Clocks;Inductors;Optimization;Program processors;Regulators;Synchronization;Voltage control","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","18-core product family;AVX2 technology;E5-2600 Xeon processor;FIVR;Intel CMOS technology;MBVR;area optimization;complimentary metal oxide semiconductor;enterprise Xeon server processor;frequency 1.6 GHz to 3.8 GHz;fully integrated voltage regulators;high-performance microprocessors;metal layer;mother-board voltage regulator;motherboard power delivery;performance improvement;power 55 W to 165 W;processor configuration;size 22 nm;voltage 1.8 V","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To further reduce standby power, BD-processors commonly use nonvolatile memory (NVM) to back up the signature patterns of SRAM-based TCAM (sTCAM) [3] during power interruptions or frequent-off operations. However, this 2-macro (sTCAM + NVM) scheme suffers long delays and requires considerable energy for wake-up operations, due to the word-by-word serial transfer of data between NVM and TCAM macros. Most of the signature patterns are seldom updated (written); therefore, single-macro nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM) can be used for BD-processors to reduce area and facilitate fast/low-power wake-up operations, compared to the 2-macro approach. Previous nvTCAMs were designed using diode-connected 4T2R with STT-MTJ (D4T2R) [4], 2T2R with PCM [5], and 4T2R with ReRAM [2]; however, they suffer the following issues: (1) large cell area (A) and high write energy (E<sub>w</sub>) due to the use of two NVM (2R) devices; (2) limited word-length (WDL, /k-bits) caused by small current-ratio (I-ratio= I<sub>ML-MIS</sub>/(K×I<sub>ML</sub>)) between match-line (ML) mismatch current (I<sub>ML-MIS</sub>) and ML leakage current of k matched cells (k × I<sub>ML-MIS</sub>); (3) Long search delays (T<sub>SD</sub>) and excessive search energy (E<sub>s</sub>) due to large ML parasitic load (C<sub>ML</sub>) and small I-ratio. ReRAM is promising for nvTCAM due to its low E<sub>w</sub>, high resistance-ratio (R-ratio), and multiple-level cell (MLC) capability. To overcome issue (1) to (3), this study develops an MLC-based 3T1R nvTCAM with bi-directional voltage-divider control (BVDC).

In 2012 the US President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended sharing government spectrum from 2.7GHz to 3.7GHz for public use while advocating that future systems deliver significantly improved spectrum efficiency. Cognitive radio systems with multi-tiered shared spectrum access (MTSSA) are expected to deliver such superior efficiency over existing scheduled-access systems; they have 3 or more device tiers with different access privileges. Lower tiered `smart' devices opportunistically use the underutilized spectrum and need spectrum sensing for incumbent detection and interférer avoidance. Incumbent detection will rely on database lookup or narrowband high-sensitivity sensing. Integrated interférer detectors, on the other hand, need to be fast, wideband and energy efficient while only requiring moderate sensitivity. During designated slot boundaries (10s of us), they quickly detect the presence of a few (3 or so) large interferers over e.g., a 1GHz span (2.7 to 3.7GHz) with a 20MHz RBW (i.e. 50 bins) so that the carrier-aggregating receiver can be reconfigured on a frame (10s of ms) or even slot (100s of us) basis.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063069","","Baseband;Detectors;Energy efficiency;Radio frequency;Wideband","UHF radio propagation;analogue-digital conversion;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;interference suppression;microwave propagation;mobility management (mobile radio);radio spectrum management;telecommunication traffic","Integrated interferer detector;MTSSA;cognitive radio system;compressed sampling;database lookup;frequency 2.7 GHz to 3.7 GHz;government spectrum sharing;incumbent detection;interferer avoidance;mobile data traffic;multitiered shared spectrum access;narrowband high sensitivity sensing;quadrature analog-to-information converter;scheduled access system;smart devices;spectrum efficiency improvement;spectrum sensing;underutilized spectrum","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mixer-first RX [1] delays the signal amplification to baseband (BB) by frequency-translating the BB lowpass response to RF as bandpass. This raises the out-of-band (OB) IIP3 (27dBm) at the expense of NF (5.5dB) and power (60mW) due to no RF gain. The noisecancellation RX [2] breaks such a tradeoff by paralleling a voltage-sensing RX with the mixer-first RX. This achieves a better pair of NF (1.9dB) and OB-IIP3 (13.5dBm), but sacrifices more die size (1.2mm<sup>2</sup>) and power (<;78mW) to accommodate the doubled RF and BB circuits. In [3], N-path RF filtering and noise cancellation are concurrently attained in one current-reuse RX. That approach saves die area (0.55mm<sup>2</sup>) and power (16.2mW) at a high OB-IIP3 (17.4dBm), but requires a high VDD (2.5V) to widen the voltage headroom. Also, seeing that its NF (4.6dB) is handicapped by the input-impedance matching requirement (S<sub>11</sub><;-10dB), there is no flexibility to get better NF. Finally, as both [2] and [3] involve two mixing steps, the LO power is penalized.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062913","","Filtering;Impedance;Impedance matching;Mixers;Noise measurement;Radio frequency;Receivers","amplification;band-pass filters;interference suppression;radio receivers;radiofrequency filters","BB lowpass response;LO power;NF;OB-IIP3;RF band-pass gain;RF-tunable blocker-tolerant receivers;baseband lowpass response;current-reuse RX;die size;double-RF N-path filtering;frequency-translation;input-impedance matching requirement;mixer-first RX;multiband multistandard radios flexibility;noise figure;noise figure 1.5 dB to 2.9 dB;noise-cancellation RX;out-of-band IIP3;power 11 mW;signal amplification;single-mixing blocker-tolerant receiver;voltage headroom;voltage-sensing RX","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an ADPLL, the transistors are used as switches with little regard to their linear analog properties. Hence, ADPLL performance should improve with the adoption of FinFET devices. Inverter delay in a 16nm FinFET process is less than half of that in a 28nm planar process, improving in-band phase noise (PN) by around 6dB [2]. Ring-type digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) provide wide frequency tuning range (FTR), but poor PN performance degrades the ADPLL figure of merit (FoM) [3].

Every one of us carries, at least, one such device in our pocket, yet we rarely think how in the world anyone could have created such a thing! Even the experts in our industry could not have predicted that this would have happened so quickly. What we have achieved in the course of the design and implementation of these sophisticated systems could be considered nothing short of a miracle, considering that billions of transistors have to work together flawlessly. (Well, sort of!) The reality is that some of these devices are now so complex that we need thousands of engineers to design, validate, and support them, including recovery from inefficiencies and bugs along the way. But, despite their ever-increasing complexity, the way we build these devices has not changed much over the past decades. Integrated-circuit (IC) design engineers blindly do what they are told - integrate as much functionality into a single device, believing that more is better! This more-the-better mentality is not surprising because we saw in the past that the more completely we integrate the cheaper things become. However, the cost and complexity of building billions of transistors on a single device is finally taking a toll on our engineers, which calls for new paradigm shifts in designing complex devices. If chip-design engineers had considered the financial optimization of the overall design process, they would have built things differently. They would have realized that certain functions are better grouped into highly specialized integrated circuits that easily and seamlessly talk to each other without compromising the overall system cost and performance. The key to making this happen is what I call the Lego-Block approach of designing integrated circuits. H- wever, in order for the Lego-Block approach to materialize, we need to change the way we architect our devices. For example, we need to define a new chip-to-chip interconnect protocol, take advantage of multi-chip-module packaging and high-speed SerDes technology, redefine the memory hierarchy to take advantage of 3D solid-state memory instead of blindly increasing the DRAM size, repartition DRAM to serve different logical functions instead of building gigantic single-die DRAM to serve every function, change the way we build DRAM so that they are optimized more for performance and power efficiency instead of capacity, and redefine what should be done in hardware versus software. In short, we need to change our way of thinking, and be brave enough to reject common wisdom! If we fail to take action, soon we will no longer see cost savings. On the other hand, if we succeed, we will see life beyond the end of Moore's Law!","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062847","","Bandwidth;Buildings;Integrated circuit interconnections;Random access memory;Smart phones;System-on-chip","innovation management;integrated circuit design","3D solid state memory;IC design innovation;Lego block approach;chip-to-chip interconnect protocol;device architecture;high speed SerDes technology;memory hierarchy;multichip module packaging","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the various innovations, a reference-multiplied architecture offers distinct advantages compared to conventional DPLLs [1]. First, low quantization noise (q-noise) can be achieved without complex q-noise cancellation schemes, since the delta-sigma modulator (DSM) has a high oversampling ratio and its q-noise is pushed to higher frequencies. Second, noise requirements of PLL building blocks become less stringent as the division value is reduced. For a digital PLL using a Nyquist-rate time-to-digital converter (TDC), if the reference is multiplied by N the time resolution of the TDC can be reduced by √N for the same noise level. Unfortunately, one drawback of the reference-multiplied PLL is the increase in power and complexity due to the reference-multiplying circuit. In this paper, we propose a reference-multiplied digital fractional-N PLL that has negligible overhead in the reference-multiplying circuit. To save power, a frequency-multiplied TDC (FMTDC) consisting of an open-loop multiplying DLL (MDLL) and a Vernier delay-line (VDL) TDC is proposed, which share their delay lines. High spurious tone coming from the open-loop MDLL is canceled by an adaptive filter located between TDC and loop filter.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063024","","Adaptive filters;Complexity theory;Delays;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Solid state circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits;delay lines;delta-sigma modulation;digital phase locked loops;frequency synthesizers;low-power electronics;microwave integrated circuits;multiplying circuits;reference circuits;time-digital conversion","CMOS;DPLL;DSM;FMTDC;MDLL;Nyquist-rate;TDC;VDL;Vernier delay-line;adaptive filter;delta-sigma modulator;digital fractional-N PLL;frequency 5 GHz;loop filter;low quantization noise;low-noise fractional-N frequency synthesizer;low-power frequency synthesizer;open-loop multiplying DLL;power 9.5 mW;q-noise;reference-multiplied time-to-digital converter;reference-spur cancellation;size 65 nm;time resolution","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performing this SI-cancellation solely in the digital domain, if at all possible, would require extremely clean (low-EVM) transmission and a huge dynamic range in the RX and ADC, which is currently not feasible [2]. Cancelling SI entirely in analog is not feasible either, since the SI contains delayed TX components reflected by the environment. Cancelling these requires impractically large amounts of tunable analog delay.

Such sensors should be: 1) Small to facilitate floor planning; 2) Fast to track millisecond thermal transients and 3) Easy to trim to reduce the associated costs. Recently, it has been shown that thermal diffusivity (TD) sensors can meet these requirements [5]. TD sensors operate by digitizing the temperature-dependent delay associated with the diffusion of heat pulses through an electro-thermal filter (ETF), which, in standard CMOS, can be readily implemented as a resistive heater surrounded by a thermopile. Unlike BJT-based temperature sensors, their accuracy actually improves with CMOS scaling [6], since it is mainly limited by the accuracy of the heater/thermopile spacing, which in turn is determined by lithography. However, the readout circuitry of prior TD sensors has been based on analog phase-domain ΔΣ ADCs, which are not easily ported to low-voltage technologies, and which occupy much more area than the ETF itself [5].","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063139","","Accuracy;CMOS integrated circuits;Modulation;Radiation detectors;Temperature sensors","CMOS integrated circuits;delta-sigma modulation;readout electronics;temperature sensors;thermal diffusivity;voltage-controlled oscillators","BJT-based temperature sensor;CMOS scaling;ETF;VCO-based readout;analog phase-domain ΔΣ ADC;electro-thermal filter;lithography;readout circuitry;resistive heater;size 0.16 mum;standard CMOS;thermal-diffusivity temperature sensor;thermopile","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When powered with a shared rail, however, energy is wasted in the core if other blocks demand higher voltage and performance. Alternately, a per-core fully-integrated voltage regulator (VR) provides a cost-effective means to realize autonomous DVFS [2-4]. In this paper, we present a graphics core that is supplied by a fully integrated and digitally controlled hybrid low-drop-out (LDO)/switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) with fast droop response (Fig. 8.6.1). While the LDO VR enables high power density and is area efficient, as it can use existing power headers originally employed for bypass/sleep modes, it suffers from efficiency loss at low VOUT. An SCVR, on the other hand, has improved conversion efficiency across a wide VOUT range. In an area-constrained design, however, the limited size of the SCVR's fly capacitors and associated configurable power stages sets an upper bound on the SCVR's maximum power density, restricting its use to lower VOUT. This LDO/SCVR combination delivers the power required by the core at a high VOUT of 0.92V with 84% LDO efficiency, while extending to a low VOUT of 0.38V with 52% SCVR efficiency from a 1.05V VIN. Compared to a shared-rail scheme, the hybrid VR enables 26% to 82% reduction in core energy versus 26% to 67% if solely the LDO is used.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062972","","Capacitors;Clocks;Control systems;Frequency measurement;Frequency modulation;Graphics;Voltage control","power aware computing;switched capacitor networks;voltage regulators","autonomous DVFS;fast droop mitigation;graphics execution core;high power density;hybrid LDO;hybrid low-drop-out;shared-rail scheme;size 22 nm;switched-capacitor VR;switched-capacitor voltage regulator;voltage 0.38 V;voltage 1.05 V","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their power efficiency is degraded considerably, as illustrated in Fig. 12.6.1, when multiple outputs are requested in a wide range, such as 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The use of P-MOSFET [1][2] and N-MOSFET [3] switches results in low efficiency of 64 and 70% at outputs of 1.2 and 3.3V, respectively, because of low gate driving voltages and large on-resistance. This implies that conventional usage of P-MOSFET and N-MOSFET switches is inappropriate in SIMO converters [1-3]. This paper presents a SIMO converter with output-independent gate drive (OIGD) control for all N-MOSFET switches. One of the salient features is that OIGD control achieves output-voltage-independent characteristics on efficiency and keeps peak efficiency of 90% over the range of 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The other salient feature is that a low-power deadtime overstress recycling (DOR) technique retrieves 95% of energy loss during deadtime and releases the overstress problem simultaneously.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063007","","Control systems;DC-DC power converters;Inductors;Logic gates;MOSFET circuits;Recycling;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;driver circuits;field effect transistor switches","DOR technique;N-MOSFET switches;OIGD control;SIMO DC-DC buck converters;energy loss;low-power deadtime overstress recycling;output independent gate drive control;portable electronics;single-inductor-multiple-output DC-DC buck converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"9.7 An LTE SAW-less transmitter using 33% duty-cycle LO signals for harmonic suppression","Yen-Horng Chen; Fong, N.; Bing Xu; Caiyi Wang","MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","With limited frequency allocation in the radio spectrum, spectral efficiency has always been the core development of communication systems. To accommodate the increase in demand for wireless data services, RF systems have been challenged to provide better in-channel SNR (EVM) and lower out-of-channel emission. As performance requirements become more stringent, second-order RF circuit impairments, that were previously insignificant, have become major design considerations. One example is the Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) [1]. Compared with previous generations, channel bandwidth has been expanded to 9MHz in most of the sub-GHz bands and 18MHz in the GHz bands. For spectral efficiency, the TX OFDM subcarriers are grouped into Resource Blocks (RBs) that can be dynamically allocated within the channel bandwidth. Noise and spurious emission requirements have become more challenging in the sub-GHz bands, so that Counter 3<sup>d</sup>-order Intermodulation products (CIM3) has been recognized as an important design parameter [2-4] for LTE RF systems. CIM3 is the result of the lower 3<sup>d</sup>-order intermodulation (IM3) product of signals at around 1×LO and 3×LO by using mixers with 25% or 50% duty-cycle LO. If an f<sub>BB</sub> tone is being fed to the TX baseband input, after the mixer and the RF amplifier, the TX RF output will produce the desired signal tone at f<sub>LO</sub>+f<sub>BB</sub> and an unwanted CIM3 tone at f<sub>L0</sub>-3f<sub>BB</sub> [3]. The adverse effects of CIM3 are shown in Fig. 9.7.1, using LTE Band 13 as an illustration. Band 13 has User-Equipment (UE) TX band from 777 to 787MHz, and RX band at -31 MHz away from TX. Extreme cases of full RB and single RB are considered. At full RBs, modulated CIM3 has a bandwidth three times the desired signal, and it folds directly into the TX channel, degrading the TX EVM and the 1st ACLR (E-UTRA). Furthermore, the ACLR of bandwidth-expanded CIM3 falls into the RX band causing desensitization. Wh- n single RB is transmitted, the CIM3 may fall into the restricted bands and violate the spectral emission requirement. Consider the Public Safety Band, where the LTE standard dictates that the emission from 769 to 775MHz has to be less than -57dBm/6.25KHz [1]. If the output power at the antenna is +23dBm and only single RB is being transmitted, the power density is 23dBm/180kHz. Normalizing to power density from 180KHz to 6.25KHz, the power density is 8.4dBm/6.25KHz, resulting in a CIM3 requirement of -65.4dB/6.25KHz. This is challenging for linearity, and also for noise requirement in the case of a SAW-less system. CIM3 suppression techniques such as harmonic rejection and power mixing have been proposed [2-5], but these techniques require extra calibrations and/or off-chip filtering components, which will be described in later paragraphs. This work presents a CIM3 suppression technique by removing the undesired 3<sup>rd</sup>-harmonic component in the LO signal through LO duty-cycle selection. With this direct root-cause elimination method, the TX meets CIM3 and RX band noise requirements for SAW-less LTE RF systems over process and temperature without calibration and off-chip filtering.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062981","","Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Noise;Power generation;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters","Long Term Evolution;OFDM modulation;filtering theory;harmonics suppression;intermodulation;radiofrequency amplifiers","ACLR;CIM3 suppression techniques;Counter 3<sup>d</sup>-order Intermodulation products;LO duty-cycle selection;LO signals;LTE RF systems;LTE SAW-less transmitter;LTE standard;Long-Term-Evolution;RF amplifier;TX EVM;TX OFDM subcarriers;channel bandwidth;direct root-cause elimination method;harmonic suppression;in-channel SNR;off-chip filtering components;out-of-channel emission;resource blocks;wireless data services","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, opamps with similar specifications have become available using CMOS based processes [2-4], which can offer a cheaper wafer price. Auto-zeroing and/or chopping are used as essential techniques to reduce offset voltage drift and 1/f noise associated with CMOS input differential pairs. The switching action of those techniques, however, results in unwanted output ripples and glitches, which requires a post-filter and limits usable signal bandwidth. Increasing the switching frequency can extend the usable signal bandwidth, though it introduces DC errors such as offset voltage drift and input bias current. Maximum offset voltage drift of 0.02μV/°C and an input bias current of 600pA have been achieved [3], although the switching frequency at 60kHz limits the usable signal bandwidth.

As platform footprints are also required to decrease, this causes a unique challenge for voltage regulation. In [2], an on-die switching fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) was demonstrated, which presents a very good solution in many cases. However, the FIVR requires inductors, which may not always be available. In addition, it may be desirable to sub-divide some of the FIVR domains using power gates and/or linear voltage regulators, such as low-drop-out regulators (LDO). LDOs can be used to enable different units of the chip to operate at their optimal voltage levels, which could save power. For example, different types of cores often have significantly different minimum-V<sub>cc</sub> levels in low-power mode.

Ideally, power efficiency at a given data rate can be improved by reducing V<sub>DD</sub> while increasing the number of multiplexed circuits operating in parallel at lower clock frequencies [1]. Though increasing the amount of parallelism is desirable to scale V<sub>DD</sub>, in practice, it is limited by two main factors. First, increased sensitivity to device variations (threshold voltage/dimension mismatch) at lower V<sub>DD</sub> makes it extremely challenging to generate equally spaced multi-phase clocks needed in multiplexed transmitter and receiver. Phase calibration methods can correct phase-spacing errors [2,3], but their effectiveness at lower V<sub>DD</sub> is limited as the calibration circuits themselves become sensitive to device variations. Second, as oscillator output swing reduces with V<sub>DD</sub>, its phase noise degrades, making low-noise clock generation difficult to implement with low power dissipation. Phase noise can be suppressed by embedding the oscillator in a wide bandwidth analog phase-locked loop (APLL), but conventional charge-pump-based APLLs are difficult to design at low supply voltages (V<sub>DD</sub> <;0.5V). Digital PLLs (DPLLs) can operate at low V<sub>DD</sub>, but they suffer from conflicting noise bandwidth tradeoffs, which prevent increasing the bandwidth to suppress oscillator phase noise adequately.

In contrast, depth estimation for stereo RGB images can provide high-resolution depth maps, even in outdoor or low-power scenarios. And, the depth accuracy can be increased by using multi-view light-field images. This paper presents an integrated circuit which estimates full HD (1920×1080) depth maps at 30fps and provides a tradeoff between depth accuracy and power consumption based on two-/three-/five-view stereo images. It addresses design challenges with three primary contributions: 1) a stripe buffering scheme which is designed to reduce the DRAM bandwidth induced by multi-view image access; 2) a four-bank interleaving architecture, which boosts computation performance by parallelizing belief-propagation (BP) operations; and, 3) an adaptive view selection unit, which realizes the accuracy-power tradeoff.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063106","","Bandwidth;Belief propagation;Buffer storage;Estimation;High definition video;Power demand;Random access memory","DRAM chips;stereo image processing","DRAM bandwidth;adaptive view selection unit;belief-propagation operation;five-view depth-estimation processor;five-view stereo images;four-bank interleaving architecture;integrated circuit;light-field application;multiview image access;power 611 mW;power consumption;stripe buffering scheme;three-view stereo images;two-view stereo images","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the need for complex controllers that ensure accurate regulation and uniform current sharing between phases along with generation of multiple matched pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals complicate the design of multi-phase converters. Hysteretic control offers the simplest means to implement multi-phase converters and has been widely used in the prior art [1]. However, its nonlinear behavior leads to large output ripple, unpredictable loop dynamics, and wide variation in switching frequency (F<sub>sw</sub>), which are undesirable in many noise-sensitive applications. Furthermore, they require current sensors to implement active current sharing, and generation of multiple synchronized PWM signals requires power hungry circuits [1]. A voltage-mode controller using a type-Ill compensator is well-suited for low-noise applications but it requires multiple synchronized and matched ramp generators that also incur large area and power penalty. A digital PWM generator can provide accurately matched multi-phase PWM signals thereby enabling passive current sharing, but digitally controlled buck converters exhibit large ripple due to their limit cycle behavior, have poor transient response, and consume significant quiescent current [2][3]. All these issues become even more challenging to address in high-F<sub>sw</sub> converters because of more stringent loop-delay requirements.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063003","","Current measurement;Generators;Pulse width modulation;Shift registers;Synchronization;Transient response;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;voltage control","4-phase time-based buck converter;CMOS;digital PWM generator;digitally controlled buck converters;frequency 30 MHz to 70 MHz;hysteretic control;load transient response;loop delay;matched multiphase PWM signals;multiphase switching dc-dc converters;pulse-width modulated signals;quiescent current;size 65 nm;switching frequency;synchronized PWM signals;type-III compensator;voltage 1.8 V;voltage-mode controller","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, channel losses and impedance discontinuities increase at high data-rates, making it difficult to compensate the channel. In this work, we target serial links from auto-negotiation in 100G-KR4 of 0.3Gb/s to 32GFC of 28.05Gb/s in 40dB backplane architecture. To achieve this challenge, there are two key techniques. First, we introduce a 36-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to cancel reflections due to connectors because these reflections close the eye. To operate the 36-tap DFE, we need to fix a CDR lock-point and calculate 36-tap coefficients accurately. Thus, we develop a pattern-captured CDR with a 4b pattern filter to fix the lock-point, and a 3b pattern-matched adaptive equalizer (AEQ) to optimize 36 tap coefficients. These techniques enable our chip to compensate 40dB channel loss. Second, we target 100G-KR4/40G-KR4/10G-KR/25G-KR and 32GFC/16GFC/8GFC/4GFC. To operate across a wide range of data-rates, from 0.3 to 28.05Gb/s, with low jitter, we develop a PLL architecture with two LC-VCOs and one ring VCO with a data-rate-adjustment technique by controlling an LDO.

In addition to consistent demands for faster random access, shorter rewrite time and larger memory capacity in eFlash, there are increasingly intense requirements for robust operations and high data reliability under extremely high junction temperature (T<sub>i</sub>,) of 170°C. On the other hand, along with device scaling beyond 40nm generation, the reliability of eFlash systems is constrained by not only eFlash memory cells but also peripheral transistors and metal interconnections. As oxide films in transistor devices and between metal interconnections are getting thinner, their time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime is critically degraded, which poses a great challenge in advanced eFlash design. This paper presents 28nm eFlash macros for automotive with four key features. The first feature is a 28nm split-gate (SG)-MONOS cell array with temperature-adjusted overdrive wordline (WL) voltage control to realize both 200MHz random access and more than 10× longer TDDB lifetime of WL drivers. Second, we implement a high-voltage control technique to relax electrical stress on memory cells and peripheral devices by temperature-adaptive step pulse erase control (TASPEC). Third, we achieve high write throughput of 2.0MB/s by source-side injection (SSI) programming with negative back-bias achieving 63% reduction of program pulse time.

Advanced perpendicular STT-MRAM achieve ~3× power saving by reducing leakage current in memory cells compared with SRAM for last level cache (LLC) [3]. Such high-speed RAM applications, however, entail several issues: the probability of read disturbance error increases and the active power of STT-MRAM must be decreased for higher access speed. Moreover, the leakage power of peripheral circuits must be decreased, because the high-speed RAM requires high-performance transistors having high leakage current in peripheral circuitry [4], limiting the energy efficiency of STT-MRAM.

Indeed, the best VCO Figure of Merit (FOM) currently reported was published by Hegazi back in 2001 [1]. That topology, shown in Fig. 25.3.1(a), employs a second resonant tank at the source terminals of the differential pair that is tuned to twice the LO frequency (F<sub>LO</sub>). The additional tank provides a high common-mode impedance at 2×F<sub>LO</sub>, which prevents the differential pair transistors from conducting in triode and thus prevents the degradation of the oscillator's quality factor (Q). As a consequence, the topology can achieve an oscillator noise factor (F)-defined as the ratio of the total oscillator noise to the noise contributed by the tank- of just below 2, which is equal to the fundamental limit of a cross-coupled LC CMOS oscillator [2]. There are, however, a few drawbacks of Hegazi's VCO: (1) the additional area required for the tail inductor, (2) the routing complexity demanded of the tail inductor, which can degrade its Q and limit its effectiveness, and (3) for oscillators with wide tuning ranges, the need to independently tune the second inductor, which again can degrade its Q. Moreover, it can be shown that the common-mode impedance of the main tank at 2×F<sub>LO</sub> also has a significant effect on the oscillator's performance, which if not properly modeled can lead to disagreement between simulation and measurement, particularly in terms of the flicker noise corner. To mitigate these issues, this work introduces a new oscillator topology that resonates the common-mode of the circuit at 2×F<sub>LO</sub>, but does not require an additional inductor.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063116","","1f noise;CMOS integrated circuits;Inductors;Phase noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;network topology;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS VCO;differential pair transistors;figure of merit;implicit common-mode resonance;oscillator noise factor;oscillator topology;tail inductor","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To minimize latency over the iterative loop and improve throughput, the MMSE detector is divided into 4 task-based coarse pipeline stages so that all stages can operate in parallel. Both the number of stages and the stage latency of the detector are minimized, and the long critical paths are interleaved and placed in a slow clock domain to support a high data rate in a cost-effective way. The resulting MMSE detector achieves an 82% higher throughput compared, and almost 3.5× the throughput of the latest SD detector. The NBLDPC decoder is implemented using 78 processing nodes to enable fully parallel message passing. Serial Galois field (GF) processing is pipelined using a data forwarding technique to cut the decoding latency by 30% over the latest design.

However, the single conversion ratio (CR) CP has a narrow input voltage range. This induces a charge redistribution loss (CRL) and becomes a bottleneck preventing highly efficient energy harvesting [2]. CRL stems from two facts: 1) The operating voltages of energy sources vary with environment, and 2) Different energy sources feature a wide range of output voltages. By tuning the CR as one dimension, reconfigurable CPs can eliminate CRL; however, they need complex control algorithms, lack maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [3], and only provide fractional ratios [4]. Thus, they are not preferable for energy harvesting from various sources.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063080","","Boosting;Charge pumps;Clocks;Energy harvesting;Maximum power point trackers;Switches;Voltage control","Internet of Things;charge pump circuits;energy harvesting;maximum power point trackers;power engineering computing","CP;CRL;Internet of Things;charge redistribution loss;inductive DC-DC boost converters;maximum power point tracking;monolithic low power energy harvesting applications;off-chip inductors;reconfigurable charge pump energy harvester;two-dimensional MPPT;voltage 0.45 V to 3 V","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of inductive power transmission is expected to see an explosive growth over the next decade as engineers try to cut the last cord from mobile electronics, small home appliances, and even electric vehicles [1]. The inductive link power transfer efficiency (PTE) is highly dependent of the loading of the receiver (Rx) coil, referred to as R<sub>L</sub>. As shown in Fig. 12.7.1a, magnetic resonance-based power transmission in the form of a 3-coil link has been proposed to maximize PTE for any given R<sub>L</sub> by transforming it to an optimal load, using k<sub>34</sub> variable [2,3]. Alternatively, an off-chip matching circuit has been used to transform R<sub>L</sub> [4]. However, these methods need either an additional coil or a network of off-chip capacitors and inductors, which add to the size/cost of Rx. Moreover, in the above applications, R<sub>L</sub> can change drastically during operation and there is a need for Rx to dynamically compensate for a wide range of R<sub>L</sub> to maintain high PTE.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063008","","Application specific integrated circuits;Charge pumps;Coils;Rectifiers;Switches;Transistors;Wireless communication","application specific integrated circuits;inductive power transmission;magnetic resonance;radio receivers","3-coil link;Q-modulation;inductive link PTE;inductive power transmission;magnetic resonance-based power transmission;off-chip capacitors;off-chip inductors;off-chip matching circuit;power transfer efficiency;power-management ASIC;receiver coil","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its high computational complexity makes software solvers, consuming 2-50W on CPUs, very energy inefficient for real-time processing. This paper presents a configurable SA engine in a 40nm CMOS technology for energy-efficient mobile data aggregation from compressively sampled biomedicai signals. Using configurable architecture, a 100% utilization of computing resources is achieved. An efficient data-shuffling scheme is implemented to reduce memory leakage by 40%. At the minimum-energy point (MEP), the SA engine achieves a real-time throughput for reconstructing 61-to-237 channels of biomedicai signals simultaneously with <;1% of a mobile device's 2W power budget, which is 76-350× more energy-efficient than prior hardware designs.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063062","","Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Energy efficiency;Engines;Throughput","CMOS integrated circuits;approximation theory;compressed sensing;medical signal processing;mobile radio;signal reconstruction","CMOS technology;CS reconstruction;MEP;compressive sensing;compressively sampled biomedicai signals;configurable SA engine;data-shuffling scheme;energy-efficient mobile data aggregation;low-power on-body sensors;minimum-energy point;mobile data aggregator;mobile device;power 12.8 mW;real-time signal reconstruction;size 40 nm;software solvers;sparse approximation problem;wireless health monitoring","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Burst-mode communication, where the link is powered-off when idle and powered-on when needed, achieves energy proportional operation. Ideally, a burst mode link must be turned on/off in zero time, must consume zero power in the off-state and must incur zero energy overhead while making on/off transitions. However, these requirements are difficult to meet in practice and as a consequence, the efficacy of burst mode communication in achieving energy proportional operation is reduced. The main challenges in achieving small power-on time and off-state power include the design of fast-locking PLLs, CDRs and achieving fast settling of bias node voltages.

In this direction, the Bluetooth standard has introduced a low-energy operative mode (BLE) with wider channel spacing (2MHz) and relaxed blocker tolerance. The minimum sensitivity required is -70dBm but even with a sensitivity 10dB lower the BLE receiver can have a noise figure close to 19dB [1]. Although linearity and noise specs have been significantly relaxed, the design of a sub-mW solution remains challenging since the power dissipation cannot be simply scaled with the spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR). In fact, the ultimate bound is set by the power burned in the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which is used for the generation of the local oscillator (LO) necessary for the signal downconversion. Since, for a targeted phase noise, the current required by the VCO is inversely proportional to the quality factor of the resonator adopted, a straightforward approach is to use a high-Q tank like the FBAR used by Wang et al. [2]. However in low-cost CMOS processes, when high-Q resonators are not present, an alternative strategy is to share the VCO bias current with the other blocks of the RF front-end as in the LMV cell proposed by Tedeschi et al.

It introduces new design features, such as the S4 core, a 64MB L3 cache subsystem with application data integrity, a low-latency, high-throughput on-chip network (OCN), a database analytic accelerator (DAX), fine-grain adaptive power management and 1.5× higher SerDes I/O bandwidth for memory, coherency and system interfaces (Fig. 4.2.1) [1]. The enhancements in the S4 core over the S3 core [2] include a new L2 cache scheme, support for visual instruction set (VIS) extensions, virtual address masking and user-level synchronization instructions to provide continuous single-thread performance improvement for SPARC processors since SPARC T4. In addition, a hierarchical modular approach, called SPARC cache cluster (SCC), is used for the core-L2-L3 cache system. Within the SCC, all four cores share a single 256KB L2 instruction cache and each core pair has its own 256KB L2 data cache. The L2 caches are organized as 2-banks and 8-ways to deliver greater than 1TB/s bandwidth to the four cores. This L2 system delivers 2× more throughput for each core with 1.5x increase in size and the same latency as the previous generation L2 cache scheme. The L2 caches connect to an 8MB, 8-way set-associative partitioned L3 cache. Having a localized L3 cache within each SCC reduces L3 latency by 25%. The chip contains eight SCCs for a total of 32-cores with 256 threads and a 64MB L3 cache with 1.6TB/S bandwidth. In order to support the bandwidth and latency requirements from 256 threads and other system agents, the OCN architecture is implemented in place of a crossbar based network used in previous SPARC processors. Each SCC connects to the OCN, which in turn connects to four on-chip memory controllers (MCUs), coherency systems and eight database analytic accelerator (DAX) engines. The SPARC M7 introduces a customized DAX engine in an - ffort to optimize performance for Oracle databases. Eight DAX engines handle simple query predicates, decompression, message passing and interrupts across cluster nodes. This query accelerator provides up to 10x better performance for single stream decompression.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062931","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Engines;Network topology;Program processors;System-on-chip;Topology","cache storage;data integrity;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","32-core 64MB L3 cache SPARC M7 processor;8-way set-associative partitioned L3 cache;DAX;L2 cache scheme;L2 data cache;L2 instruction cache;MCU;OCN;OCN architecture;Oracle databases;S4 core;SCC;SPARC M6;SPARC cache cluster;SerDes IO bandwidth;VIS;application data integrity;commercial applications;continuous single-thread performance improvement;database analytic accelerator;fine-grain adaptive power management;four on-chip memory controllers;high-throughput on-chip network;single stream decompression;throughput performance improvement;visual instruction set extensions","","1","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most previous standards for these networking applications use NRZ signaling. However, practical signal integrity constraints have led to a renewed interest in also supporting PAM4 for some applications and loss profiles. Recently, several transmitters have been reported that operate between 28 and 60Gb/s using NRZ or PAM4 modulation exclusively. However, high-speed SerDes building blocks that support both a wide frequency range and multiple forms of modulation provide more compatibility between components and avoid the development of multiple IPs. In addition, these blocks must continue to scale into the next-generation of CMOS process technologies to lower the cost by reducing area and power consumption. This paper presents a dual-mode transmitter (TX) implemented in 14nm CMOS that supports both NRZ and PAM4 modulations and operates from 16 to 40Gb/s. The TX incorporates a 4-tap NRZ FIR filter that is reconfigurable to drive PAM4 levels, quarter-rate clocking with a high-bandwidth 4:1 serializer, a duty-cycle and quadrature-error correction circuit with statistical phase error detection, and compact, multi-layer T-coils for pad capacitance (C<sub>pad</sub>) reduction.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062925","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Delays;Modulation;Optical signal processing;Resistors;Transmitters","CMOS integrated circuits;FIR filters;error correction;error detection;power consumption;radio transmitters","CMOS integrated circuit;CMOS process technology;NRZ FIR filter;NRZ signaling;PAM4 dual-mode transmitter;high-speed SerDes building blocks;power consumption;quadrature error correction;quarter-rate NRZ;radio transmitters;signal integrity constraints;size 14 nm;statistical phase error detection;wireline communication","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a fractional-/VADPLL that employs a new time-to-digital conversion technique based on sub-sampling phase detection. It is accomplished by directly sampling the analog voltage signal at the PLL's high frequency node and converting it into a digital code. This achieves a higher time resolution with less power.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063029","","Calibration;Frequency synthesizers;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Power demand;Signal resolution","frequency synthesizers;phase detectors;phase locked loops;time-digital conversion","all-digital phase-locked loop;analog voltage signal;divider feedback;in-band phase noise;reference signal;subsampling all-digital fractional-N frequency synthesizer;subsampling phase detection;time-to-digital conversion technique;time-to-digital converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To observe faster phenomena such as plasma generation in laser processing, the state of electrons in a chemical reaction, and so on, much faster cameras are desired. There are several factors that prevent the speed-up of the ultra-high-speed imager: high gate control voltages and high power dissipation for high-efficiency multi-stage charge transfer in CCD imagers, and the current density limit of the power and ground lines and RC-constant of the vertical readout lines in CMOS imagers. Computational imaging can be a promising option to break the design limit of solid-state ultra-high-speed imagers. Several dedicated CMOS imagers have been demonstrated [3,4].

Recently, time-interleaved (TI) SARs have been a popular choice for low-power, medium-speed, mid-resolution ADCs [1-3]. As the conversion rate and resolution requirements increase, TI-SARs become less attractive in terms of power efficiency and complexity compared to TI-pipelined ADCs [4], where the critical SNR, THD, and TI matching are only required in the MDACs resolving the MSBs. In this paper we report a hybrid of TI-pipelined MDAC and TI-SAR, in which the former resolves the 2 MSB bits and the latter resolves the 8 lower bits. This hybrid architecture combines the advantages from each ADC type to achieve better power at 5GS/s. The front-end is implemented by time-interleaving two 2.5b MDAC slices, easing the timing-matching requirement and complexity. The MDAC stage also eases the timing-matching requirement among the TI-SARs by presenting an amplified-and-held signal to each SAR input. This allows taking advantage of a low-resolution SAR's simplicity and low power, for the last 8b. This work also proposes a SHA-less front-end to further minimize the ADC power. Two simple calibration techniques are introduced on-chip to enable the topology: (a) an over-range calibration (ORcal) loop to correct the sampling-time error between MDAC and sub-ADC in the SHA-less front-end, and (b) SAR reference calibration to align the SAR's full-scale to the MDAC's. Figure 26.6.1 shows the timing and functional block diagram of the 5GS/s hybrid SHA-less ADC. The RF buffer directly drives two TI-slices, each comprising a 2.5GS/S MDAC stage to resolve the 2.5 MSB bits, followed by 4-way interleaved 625MS/S SARs to resolve the lower 8b, for a combined 10b resolution (1b overlap), at 5GS/s.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063129","","CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Clocks;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Signal to noise ratio;System-on-chip","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;calibration;sampling methods","SAR hybrid ADC;amplified-and-held signal;calibration techniques;direct sampling;hybrid architecture;pipelined hybrid ADC;power 150 mW;sampling-time error;size 28 nm;time-interleaved SAR","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optical transceiver with a retiming capability would significantly enhance the usability of the link by extending the reach. Such optical transceivers should operate without an external clock source since a small form factor is imperative. The optical link we develop has a four-lane configuration that consists of an electrical-to-optical (E/O) converter and an optical-to-electrical (O/E) convertor (Fig. 22.7.1). Both the E/O and O/E convertors are equipped with a per-lane reference-less clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuit that enables independent operation of each lane. The transceiver pitch is 250μm/lane, which matches the fiber pitch of the optical-fiber array used in the link. Since the jitter added by the CDR should be minimized in retimer applications, an LC-VCO is a preferable choice for clock-signal generation. At this transceiver pitch, however, the coupling through mutual inductances between LC tanks has a significant impact on the CDR characteristics. To address this concern, we analyze the impact of inter-VCO coupling and design the CDR so that the coupling does not affect the CDR performance. Each lane of the E/O convertor consists of a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), a CDR, and a VCSEL driver with a two-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) (Fig. 22.7.1). Each lane of the O/E convertor has a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) stage followed by a limiting amplifier (LA), a CDR, and an electrical-line driver with a two-tap FFE. All the CDRs have an identical design consisting of a flip-flop for the data decision, a selector for bypass-mode operation, a Pottbacker type phase-frequency detector (PFD) [1], a charge pump (CP), a lag-lead filter, and a quadrature LC-VCO (QVCO). During the bypass mode, the CDR loop is set into a power-down mode where the VCO does not oscillate.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063101","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Couplings;Integrated optics;Optical fiber communication;Optical fibers","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Ge-Si alloys;inductance;laser cavity resonators;optical links;optical transceivers;semiconductor materials;surface emitting lasers;voltage-controlled oscillators","CDR;LC tanks;Pottbacker type phase-frequency detector;SiGe;SiGe BiCMOS;VCSEL driver;bypass-mode operation;charge pump;continuous-time linear equalizer;data decision;electrical-line driver;electrical-optical converter;flip-flop;four-lane configuration;inter-VCO coupling;lag-lead filter;limiting amplifier;mutual inductances;optical links;optical transceiver;optical-electrical convertor;optical-fiber array;quadrature LC-VCO;retimer IC;size 0.13 mum;trans- impedance amplifier;transceiver pitch;two-tap feed-forward equalizer","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SAR ADC is well known for its excellent power efficiency. However, its intrinsic accuracy (DAC matching) is limited up to 10 to 12b in modern CMOS technologies [1]. Scaling up the device dimensions can improve matching but it deteriorates power-efficiency and speed. Alternatively, calibrations [2-5] are introduced to correct errors (e.g., comparator offset and capacitor mismatch) and push the SNDR beyond 62dB. However, most of the calibrations [2-4] are implemented off-chip and the power for the calibration circuit is relatively high when implemented on-chip. Foreground calibration [4-5] is an alternative but is sensitive to environmental changes. We report a low-power fully automated on-chip background calibration that uses a redundancy-facilitated error-detection-and-correction scheme.

Consisting of two low-resolution charge-redistribution SARADCs coupled by a residue amplifier, a SAR-assisted pipeline ADC relaxes the noise requirements of the second stage and enhances the overall ADC speed while maintaining excellent power efficiency [1-4]. However, designs reported in [1,2] rely on power-hungry telescopic amplifiers that also limit the available inter-stage residue gain due to low output swing. A lower-power alternative is a dynamic amplifier, which operates as an open-loop time-domain integrator [3,4]. Although time-domain integration provides the benefit of noise filtering, the calibration required to achieve an accurate residue gain increases design complexity and test cost, and limits robustness. We introduce an uncalibrated fully differential ring-amplifier-based 13b 50MS/s rail-to-rail input swing SAR-assisted pipeline ADC with Waiden and Schreier (SNDR) FoMs of 6.9fJ/conversion-step and 174.9dB, respectively.

Another issue associated with PLLs is the difficulty to integrate on-chip loop filters. Active loop filters are employed to scale down the loop filter capacitors and enable them to be fully integrated on-chip [3]. However, this method suffers from large active noise induced by the op-amp. Moreover, as the capacitance is reduced, the resistor value has to be increased to maintain the same zero frequency, leading to higher thermal noise and limiting achievable scaling factor. Another method is to integrate digital loop filters in all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs) [4]. Unfortunately, the quantization noise of digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs) becomes a bottleneck to achieve good phase noise due to their limited frequency resolution. Furthermore, E-band DCO oscillation frequency is more sensitive to capacitor variation, making it even more difficult to achieve high frequency resolution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 70.5-to-85.5GHz PLL with an injection-locked frequency tripler (ILFM3) and passive scaling to increase the effective capacitor for the loop filter by 100 times.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063119","","Capacitors;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency multipliers;millimetre wave filters;millimetre wave integrated circuits;phase locked loops;quadrature amplitude modulation","16-QAM modulation;CMOS scaling;DCO;E-band;ILFM3;active loop filters;all-digital PLL;digital loop filters;digitally-controlled oscillators;frequency 70.5 GHz to 85.5 GHz;injection-locked frequency tripler;integrated on-chip;loop filter capacitors;on-chip loop filters;op-amp;passive scaling;phase-locked loop;quantization noise;size 65 nm","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve flexible interconnects on a bandwidth demand, a CDR is required to operate at multiple rates in a wide tuning range. A selectable multi-VCO structure is one method to overcome this issue. However, when multi-VCOs are allocated in each channel, the large size of VCOs makes it difficult to achieve a high-density optical link.

While the potential payoff is tantalizing, several challenges must still be solved before EB duplexers can become commercially viable. Specifically, the duplexer must provide high isolation and linearity in both the TX and RX bands across wide bandwidth (BW), with low insertion loss (IL), all in the presence of a real antenna whose impedance is constantly varying due to real-world user interaction.

In this paper, we present a switched-capacitor loop filter (SCLF) to solve this problem. The developed SCLF with correlated double sampling (CDS) keeps the output of the charge pump (CP) near-ground to improve its noise, linearity, and power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR). Furthermore, a calibrated 2b ADC is used to realize type-II operation.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062990","","Clocks;Noise;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Switches;Timing;Voltage-controlled oscillators","charge pump circuits;phase locked loops;quantisation (signal);switched capacitor filters","charge pump;correlated double sampling;mobile baseband applications;near-ground pre-distorted filter;phase interpolators;quantization noise;switched-capacitor loop filter;wideband fractional-N PLL;wideband fractional-N ring PLL","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless power transferring methods can be classified into two types: inductive and resonant. For the resonant type, wider-range power transfer is possible, and multiple devices with different power requirements can be charged at the same time. The Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) has chosen the 6.78MHz ISM band as the power-transfer frequency [1]. At 6.78MHz, the associated switching loss is an order of magnitude larger than that in a typical wireless receiver based on an inductive coupling, with a carrier frequency of around 200kHz. Besides the two fundamental aspects of switching frequency and power, there is a third important parameter, notably the higher input voltage range needed for the `loosely coupled' resonant type, which is 25V maximum for this work. Ref. [2] appears to be one of few works that can be entirely related to the current work, targeting the same application. However, it does not integrate the most critical parts of the receiver, such as the AC-DC rectifier. Other works in the same frequency range are either limited to low-power applications [3] or the AC-DC rectifier is a stand-alone chip [4-5].","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063010","","Receivers;Rectifiers;Resonant frequency;Voltage control;Voltage measurement;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","AC-DC power convertors;inductive power transmission;low-power electronics;radio receivers;radiofrequency power transmission;rectifiers;resonant power convertors;switching convertors","A4WP;AC-DC rectifier;ISM band;alliance for wireless power;frequency 6.78 MHz;fully integrated wireless power receiver;inductive wireless power transfer frequency;low-power applications;magnetic resonance coupling;medical implants;portable consumer electronic devices;power 6 W;resonant wireless power transfer;switching loss;ubiquitous (WPT) systems;voltage 25 V;wireless power transfer system","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One common solution is to harvest energy from ambient light through photovoltaic (PV) modules. In such a system, a battery supplements energy when the power provided by the environment is insufficient or when the WSN is active, and stores surplus energy for future use when the WSN is inactive. Accordingly, power management in an EH system involves a balance among the PV module, battery and load. Previous work [1] has implemented an EH system for moving vehicles and portable devices, but it is not suitable for indoor light energy harvesting. Although a single-inductor multi-input multi-output (SIMIMO) topology is one solution, the efficiencies of existing implementations [2-4] are degraded by additional conduction and switching losses due to the inductor-sharing switches in series with the inductor. In response, this paper proposes an energy-recycling strategy and implements the corresponding power converter with fewer switches.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063082","","Batteries;Energy harvesting;Inductors;Maximum power point trackers;Recycling;Voltage control;Wireless sensor networks","DC-DC power convertors;energy harvesting","energy-recycling strategy;light energy harvesting;peak conversion efficiency;three-switch single-inductor dual-input buck/boost DC-DC converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the phase noise and spurious tone performance of previously published digital PLLs is inferior to that of the best analog PLLs. This is because all fractional-N PLLs introduce quantization noise, and in prior digital PLLs this noise has higher power or spurious tones than in comparable analog PLLs. Digital PLLs based on ΔΣ frequency-to-digital conversion (FDC-PLLs) offer a potential solution to this problem in that their quantization noise ideally is equivalent to that of analog PLLs, but prior FDC-PLLs incorporate charge pumps and ADCs that have so far limited their performance and minimum supply voltages [7,8]. This paper presents an FDC-PLL that avoids these limitations by implementing the functionality of a charge pump and ADC with a simple dual-mode ring oscillator (DMRO) and digital logic. Also demonstrated is a new quantization noise cancellation (QNC) technique that relaxes the fundamental bandwidth versus quantization noise tradeoff inherent to most fractional-TV PLLs. The new techniques enable state-of-the-art spurious tone performance and very low phase noise with a lower power dissipation and supply voltage than previously published state-of-the-art PLLs in the same class shown in Fig. 25.1.6.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063114","","Bandwidth;Frequency synthesizers;Modulation;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Quantization (signal)","charge pump circuits;frequency synthesizers;oscillators;phase locked loops;phase noise;quantisation (signal)","charge pumps;digital fractional-N PLL;digital logic;dual-mode ring oscillator;highly-digital frequency synthesizer;phase noise;quantization noise cancellation technique;ring-oscillator frequency-to-digital conversion;wireless applications","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classic techniques, i.e., outphasing, envelope tracking, and Doherty PAs, offer marginal efficiency improvement at deep PBO in practice. Dual-mode PAs require switches at the PA output for high-/low-power mode selection [1,2], posing reliability and linearity challenges. Although simple supply switching (Class-G) is effective at deep PBO, it only offers Class-B-like PBO efficiency in each supply mode [3,4].

Frame-based [1] and event-driven [2,3] vision sensors have been reported. The former captures motion from the difference between captured data of a previous frame and that of a current frame; thus, it is difficult to capture motion of a slowly moving object. An event-driven sensor captures motion of a slowly moving object; however, its pixel configuration is complicated, and it is difficult to perform both motion capturing and image capturing. In this paper, we report a vision sensor for motion capturing having in-pixel non-volatile analog memory utilizing a c-axis aligned crystalline In-Ga-Zn oxide (CAAC-IGZO), a crystalline oxide semiconductor based FET that demonstrates very low off-state current [4] and retains captured data of a given reference frame. Although an electronic global shutter image sensor with improved floating diffusion (FD) charge retention characteristics is reported in [5], our vision sensor realizes normal global shutter and motion capturing depending on the presence or absence of differences with respect to a given reference frame in each pixel. The sensor has 3 modes: an imaging mode to output captured data in pixels, a motion-capturing mode to process differential data using an analog processor, and a standby mode to reduce power after motion capturing for each frame. Power consumption is reduced by operating only circuit blocks needed for each mode. The sensor (240×160 pixels), fabricated by a 0.5μm CAAC-IGZO FET/0.18μm p-channel Si FET (no n-channel Si FET) hybrid process shows power consumption of 25.3μW and 1.88μW at 60fps in the motion-capturing and standby modes, respectively, which equal 1/140<sup>th</sup> and 1/2000<sup>th</sup> of the power consumption of the imaging mode.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062954","","Field effect transistors;Imaging;Integrated circuits;Power demand;Silicon;Timing","CMOS image sensors;II-VI semiconductors;computer vision;elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;gallium compounds;image capture;indium compounds;motion estimation;random-access storage;silicon;wide band gap semiconductors;zinc compounds","CAAC-IGZO FET;InGaZnO-Si;analog processor;charge retention characteristics;crystalline oxide semiconductor FET;differential data process;electronic global shutter image sensor;event driven vision sensor;floating diffusion;frame-based vision sensor;hybrid process;image capture;imaging mode;in-pixel non-volatile analog memory;motion capture;motion capturing mode;off-state current;p-channel Si FET;power 25.3 muW;power consumption;size 0.5 mum;size 18 mum;standby mode","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lowering V<sub>in</sub> can also allow an ULP system to continue operation longer as its battery or energy harvested input voltage decreases. The minimum V<sub>in</sub> for state-of-the-art BGRs is restricted by V<sub>EB</sub>+V<sub>DS</sub> [1], where V<sub>EB</sub> is the emitter-base voltage of a pnp transistor, and V<sub>DS</sub> is the drain-source saturation voltage of a MOS transistor.

In addition, any successful 3D sensing solution for mobile devices must consume low power and small silicon area to be compatible with limited battery and space resources.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062956","","Capacitance;Fingers;Mobile handsets;Oscillators;Tactile sensors;Three-dimensional displays","screens (display);tactile sensors;television displays;touch sensitive screens","3D contactless touch sensor;battery constrained mobile device;bootstrapped and correlated double sampling;monitor type display;power 2.3 mW;resistive display electrode;size 11 cm;space constrained mobile devices;television display","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, efficient generation of power at mm-Waves is challenging in modern silicon processes with low breakdown voltages. Recent efforts have demonstrated ""Watt-level"" power generation using both silicon CMOS and HBT processes , but with <;10 % peak Power-Added-Efficiency (PAE) and without the ability to support modulation or power control efficiently. mm-Wave power DACs have been reported before, but with moderate output power (~ 24dBm) and low peak and average PAE (<;7%). This paper introduces a Watt-level mm-Wave digital power amplifier with significantly higher PAE at peak power level and back-off compared to existing state-of-the-art. Using highly efficient stacked Class-E amplifier unit cells, a 28.9dBm digital power amplifier is reported using a 0.13um SiGe HBT process with 18.4% peak PAE and 11% PAE at -6dB back-off with 8-level output amplitude control. Several innovative features like supply switch-less Class-E modulators to enable peak PAE, and a variable characteristic-impedance (Z<sub>char</sub>) transmission-line-based dynamic load modulation network to maintain PAE under back-off have been demonstrated.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062918","","Heterojunction bipolar transistors;Impedance;Modulation;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Power transmission lines;Silicon germanium","BiCMOS digital integrated circuits;Ge-Si alloys;bipolar MIMIC;digital circuits;field effect MIMIC;low-power electronics;millimetre wave power amplifiers","PAE;SiGe;dynamic load modulation;millimeter wave digital power amplifier;millimeter wave silicon transceiver;power added efficiency;stacked class-e amplifier unit cells","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the flexible transceiver, a digital-intensive transmitter has many advantages and has been pursued intensively. The efficiency of the transmitter chain is strongly dependent on the PA, and switching PAs, such as Class-D and F PAs, are used due to their high efficiency. A polar transmitter is suited for the switching operation and receives a large attention. However, a CORDIC is needed for l/Q-to-Polar conversion, and it is very complex. Moreover, the polar signal has a large bandwidth compared to the l/Q signal bandwidth. On the contrary, the quadrature transmitter that does not require the CORDIC, is simple and low computing cost with low power consumption. Due to the favorable characteristics, the quadrature transmitters have been studied. [1] employs an RFDAC based on a Gilbert mixer. It operates in a current mode and the output impedance varies with the number of on-cells. Due to the impedance variation, it is difficult to have a high linearity. In [2], the input digital code is processed by delta-sigma modulation for smaller digital bits and enhanced resolution. However the modulator generates quantization noise. In [3-6], a voltage-mode transmitter is employed with a power combiner based on a switched capacitor. The output impedance is constant, determined by the total capacitance regardless of the on/off cell condition. Moreover, this architecture delivers much higher output power and efficiency than previously reported works. [4] used delta-sigma modulation with cascade PWM to improve linearity. In [5], a quadrature architecture was employed to eliminate the problems of the polar architecture. Due to the 90° phase difference of conventional digital l/Q LOs, the output power of the conventional quadrature transmitter has lower than that of polar, maxim- m 3dB lower when the magnitude of I and Q are equal.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062979","","Capacitors;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Power generation;Radio transmitters;Switches","delta-sigma modulation;power combiners;pulse width modulation;software radio;transmitters","CORDIC;Gilbert mixer;IQ cell sharing;RFDAC;SDR transceiver;cascade PWM;delta-sigma modulation;digital-intensive transmitter;efficient digital quadrature transmitter;polar transmitter;power combiner;quantization noise;software-defined radio transceiver;switched capacitor;voltage-mode transmitter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A CMOS assay system-on-chip (SoC) offering a fast and cheap disease screening tool can be very helpful in the place where the medical resources are limited and the test is too costly to afford. Unlike the previously proposed CMOS biomolecular detection based on direct detection [1], a sandwiched assay detection protocol is adopted in this work, which possesses high sensitivity, high specificity and is free from pre-purified antigen process. As shown in Figure 1, a human blood sample containing the target biomolecules is applied on the proposed SoC. The test procedure includes blood filtration, biomolecular conjugation, electrolytic pumping, magnetic flushing and detection, automatically controlled by a micro-controller unit (MCU). The biomolecular signal is converted to the electrical signal by a CMOS-based Hall sensor array, as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 21.6.1, where the surface is coated with biomolecular probe.

Ring-oscillator (RO) based injection-locked (IL) clocking has been used in the past to provide a low-power, low-area and low-jitter solution. Ring-based injection-locked oscillators (ILO) can also be used to generate quadrature phases from a reference clock without frequency division, which is desirable for half-rate and quarter-rate CDR. However, ILO inherently has a small locking range making it less suitable for wideband applications. In addition, drift in the free-running frequency due to PVT variations may lead to poor jitter performance and locking failures. Adding a PLL to an ILO provides frequency tracking. However, PLL-aided techniques have second-order characteristics that lead to jitter peaking. They also add design complexity and power consumption . We present a frequency-tracking method that exploits the dynamics of IL in a quadrature RO to increase the effective locking range. This quadrature locked loop (QLL) is used to generate accurate clock phases for a 4-channel optical receiver using a forwarded clock at quarter-rate. The QLL drives an ILO at each channel without any repeaters for local quadrature clock generation. Each local ILO has deskew capability for phase alignment. The receiver maintains per-bit energy consumption across wide data-rates (16 to 32Gb/s) by adaptive body biasing (BB) in a 28nm FDSOI technology.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063097","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Generators;Jitter;Optical receivers;Optical variables measurement","CMOS integrated circuits;clocks;injection locked oscillators;integrated optoelectronics;low-power electronics;optical receivers","FDSOI CMOS technology;adaptive body biasing;adaptive optical receiver;bit rate 16 Gbit/s to 32 Gbit/s;forwarded clock;frequency 4 GHz to 11 GHz;injection locked oscillator;on-chip clock generation;quadrature locked loop;quarter rate clocking;size 28 nm","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For duty detection in a DCC, analog schemes using charge pumps [1] and digital schemes using DLL locking [2] or time-to-digital converters (TDC) [3] are widely used. However, they require a certain amount of time proportional to duty errors or a high-resolution TDC to resolve quantization errors. For correction, an edge combiner or slew-rate-changing inverter is commonly used in DRAM applications. An edge combiner utilizes 180°-phase-shifted clocks, which are obtained by DLL locking or TDC code calculation [4-5], to generate both edges, but it has high-frequency limitations due to gate-delay-based short-pulse generation. The slew-rate-changing inverter has trade-offs between range and resolutions or between resolutions and DCC locking time. To achieve both wide range and fast locking, asynchronous binary search for detection and receiver tail-current tuning can be used for correction [6]. In a WCK-based system, duty and phase skew between iclk and qclk are related to the detection range. However, for normal DDR DRAM, this range should be doubled resulting in more area as well as locking time. To resolve problems with locking time, coverage, and resolution, a hybrid DCC is presented in this paper. For precise duty error detection, the phase and DCC locking processes should be separated, because delay updating disturbs duty-error detecting and averaging. In this paper, an all-digital DCC with TDC and an enhanced edge combiner performs fast DCC operation before DLL coarse locking, and a slew-rate-changing DCC optimized for fine resolution compensates quantization errors caused by all-digital operation.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063056","","Clocks;Delays;Image edge detection;Noise;Quantization (signal);Random access memory;Semiconductor device measurement","DRAM chips;charge pump circuits;circuit optimisation;circuit tuning;logic design;three-dimensional integrated circuits;time-digital conversion","DCC locking processes;DCC locking time;DCC operation;DLL coarse locking;TDC code calculation;TSV;WCK-based system;all-digital DCC;analog schemes;asynchronous binary search;charge pumps;data-valid window;digital DLL;digital schemes;duty detection;duty error detection;duty error extraction;duty-cycle correction circuits;edge combiner;gate-delay-based short-pulse generation;hybrid DCC;phase aligner;phase skew;phase-shifted clocks;quantization errors;receiver tail-current tuning;slew-rate-changing inverter;stack DDR4 SDRAM;time-to-digital converters","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Maximum-length cables require the highest performance, and hence, determine the worst-case power dissipation of the transceiver. In practice, however, the vast majority of cable lengths used are below 30m. For these shorter cables, the standard specifies the transmitted power level to be lowered, inherently leading to a reduction in power consumption of the transmitter (TX). In most designs, the power consumption of the receiver (RX), unfortunately, does not benefit from the shorter cable lengths [1,2]. This paper presents a power-efficient 13b RX, implemented in 28nm CMOS. By switching to a 10b mode for short cables, 143mW is saved in the AFE for one complete Ethernet port, comprising four receivers. In addition, to further reduce power, the RX heavily relies on calibrations.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063126","","CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Electronics packaging;Radiation detectors;Receivers;System-on-chip;Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits;local area networks;power consumption;radio receivers;radio transmitters","10GBASE-T Ethernet;CMOS;Ethernet transceiver;Ethernet transmission;IEEE 802.3an standard;analog front end;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;calibrations;power 143 mW;receiver;size 28 nm;transmitter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IAs must be designed to achieve low noise and low power, good noise efficiency factor (NEF), good gain matching and low crosstalk among multiple channels [1]. For a continuous sensor array application, each sensor unit is conventionally connected to an individual amplifier for analog signal processing. This configuration consumes large chip area and high power. Furthermore, the quality of gain matching among channels is limited due to the independence of each channel. In [2-3], several multi-channel schemes addressing some of these difficulties are reported. This paper demonstrates a prototype capacitively-coupled IA (CCIA) that adopts an orthogonal frequency chopping (OFC) technique to realize a continuous two-channel CCIA with only one active amplifier, thus saving chip area and power. The whole two-channel CCIA, realized in 0.35μm CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.061mm<sup>2</sup> (area per channel is 0.0305mm<sup>2</sup>). This 2-channel IA draws 27μA from a 3V supply. It achieves a low input-referred noise of 26nVA/Hz, reasonable NEF of 3.74, and good gain matching with mismatch of less than 0.55%.

One key enabling technology for this paradigm is a new class of radios that offer cost/size approaching RFID while still maintaining peer-to-peer connectivity like more complex radios. These radios need to be cheap and thin, which means they should be fabricated using wafer-scale semiconductor processing. The existing paradigm (quartz crystals used as a frequency reference in radios) is a huge bottleneck in reducing cost and size of these devices. MEMS frequency references have replaced quartz crystals in some applications [1-3]. For example, [1] reports a MEMS reference with 0.5ppm stability but the power consumption (~100mW) and supply voltage (1.8V) are not suitable for low-voltage/low-power radios. [2] reports a 32kHz, 3ppm reference for mobile time-keeping applications, but is unsuitable for radio frequency synthesis due to its low output frequency. In this paper, we report a thin-Film Bulk-Acoustic-Resonator (FBAR) frequency reference suitable for low-voltage/low-power radio applications. The reported FBAR reference achieves a stability of +/- 3ppm from 0 to 90C. We achieve this by using an electronic temperature compensation scheme to improve the intrinsic +/-50ppm stability of an FBAR oscillator down to +/- 3ppm (Fig. 25.9.1). The core of the temperature compensation scheme is a temperature sensor that achieves a 1.75mK resolution at a 100mS sampling time.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063122","","Film bulk acoustic resonators;Frequency modulation;Micromechanical devices;Oscillators;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Thermal stability","acoustic resonators;bulk acoustic wave devices;compensation;low-power electronics;radio equipment;temperature sensors;thin film devices","FBAR frequency reference;FBAR oscillator;electronic temperature compensation scheme;frequency 750 MHz;low-power radio;low-voltage radio;power 1.1 mW;temperature 0 C to 90 C;temperature 1.75 mK;temperature sensor;thin-film bulk-acoustic-resonator;time 100 ms;voltage 750 mV","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Supply-voltage scaling is the predominant approach to active power reduction for SoC design, including voltage scaling for on-die memory given increasing levels of memory integration. SRAM can limit the minimum operating voltage (V<sub>MIN</sub>) of a design, often leading to the introduction of separate voltage supplies for on-die memory. Additional supplies increase platform cost, and operating memory at higher voltage leads to increased power consumption. The introduction of trigate devices at the 22nm technology node delivered superior short channel effects and subthreshold slope relative to existing bulk planar device technology enabling reduction in threshold voltage within a fixed leakage constraint.

Removing the TX SAW filter by adopting innovative transmitter topologies not only reduced the amount of external components, but also paved the way for monolithic power amplifier (PA) integration into the CMOS transceiver IC. This step poses additional challenges in terms of RX-TX cross-talk, self-heating and remodulation (unwanted frequency modulation of local oscillator by modulated output signal, very critical in IQ direct modulators, much less pronounced in polar modulators).

Single-Inductor Multiple-Output (SIMO) converters are excellent candidates to meet this requirement [1-3]. However, there are several issues with SIMO converters, such as cross regulation, instability and inefficiency at light load. Under normal load conditions, comparator-based controlled SIMO converters [1,2] show good cross regulation performance due to the fast response of the comparator. However, the switching loss remains constant and degrades light load efficiency due to the fixed switching frequency of output switches. The low-efficiency characteristic when any output is under light load condition is a critical issue that must be solved because a SIMO converter is very suitable for light load applications. In addition, the cross regulation issue appears again when any output is under no load because the output receives energy from the inductor every cycle despite the load condition. To solve these issues, a SIMO converter was previously reported to support Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) mode [3]. However, the mode change control method increases the complexity of the control loop, which makes it unsuitable for a multi-output SIMO converter. In this paper, an Error Based Controlled (EBC) SIMO converter is presented to resolve the problems raised above using load-dependent Adaptive Pulse Modulation (APM). A hybrid topology composed of a switching converter and a linear regulator is also presented to minimize the cross regulation issue. To highlight the advantages, a 10-output SIMO converter is designed.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063006","","Control systems;Inductors;Switching converters;Switching frequency;Topology;Transient analysis;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;adaptive modulation;comparators (circuits);inductors;network topology;pulse frequency modulation;switching convertors","APM;EBC SIMO converter;comparator-based controlled SIMO converter;cross regulation minimization;error-based controlled single inductor 10-output DC-DC buck converter;hybrid topology;linear regulator;load-dependent adaptive pulse modulation;mode change control method;power-management IC;pulse frequency modulation mode;single inductor multiple output converter;switching converter;switching loss","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pulse frequency modulation (PFM) power converters can support this large load variation with a high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) [2].

Contemporary sensor interfaces digitize raw sensor data to extract information with energy-intensive computations, such as FFT, which is inefficient if the end goal is to only extract selective information for classification tasks, e.g. voice activity detection (VAD). Previous work shows energy gains from early data reduction through analog feature extraction [1] or embedded classification hardware [2]. However, the potential energy savings of these devices is limited as they cannot adapt to changes in the sensed information content or sensing context, such as the amount/type of acoustic background noise. In the processor design community, such adaptivity to varying operating conditions is actively researched through the concept of hierarchical computing [3]. This work integrates the concept of hierarchical operation with adaptive early data extraction and classification, towards a power- and context-aware information-extraction sensor interface. This paper specifically reports on a μW 90nm CMOS VAD, that dynamically adapts sensing resources to signal information content and context, thus only spending energy on relevant information extraction. An order of magnitude in power savings is achieved by exploiting hierarchical sensing, run-time activated/scalable analog feature extraction and tightly-integrated context-aware mixed-signal machine learning inference, enabling novel applications in area of acoustic sensing [1,4].","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063110","","Accuracy;Acoustics;Context;Detectors;Feature extraction;Power demand","CMOS integrated circuits;acoustic signal detection;acoustic signal processing;fast Fourier transforms;feature extraction;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification;speech processing;ubiquitous computing","90nm CMOS VAD;90nm CMOS voice activity detector;FFT;acoustic sensing;adaptive early data classification;adaptive early data extraction;always-listening sensors;contemporary sensor interfaces;context-aware hierarchical information-sensing;context-aware information-extraction sensor interface;energy-intensive computations;energy-scarce devices;fast Fourier transform;hierarchical computing concept;intelligent scalable interfaces;power savings;power-aware information-extraction sensor interface;processor design community;raw sensor data digitization;remote-controls;run-time activated feature extraction;scalable analog feature extraction;selective information extraction;sensing resources;signal information content;tightly-integrated context-aware mixed-signal machine learning inference;watches","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integrating capacitive sensors into a small wireless sensor system is challenging due to their large power consumption relative to the total system power/energy budget, which can be as low as a few nW [4]. Typical capacitance-to-digital converters (CDCs) use charge sharing or charge transfer between capacitors to convert the sampled capacitance to voltage, which is then measured with an ADC [1-6]. This approach requires complex analog circuits, such as amplifiers and ADCs, increasing design complexity and often increasing power consumption. Moreover, the initial capacitance to voltage conversion essentially limits the input capacitance range because of output voltage saturation. This paper presents a fully digital CDC that is based on the observation that when a ring oscillator (RO) is powered from a charged capacitance, the number of RO cycles required to discharge the capacitance to a fixed voltage is naturally linear with the capacitance value. This observation enables a simple, fully digital conversion scheme that is inherently linear. As a result, the proposed CDC performs conversion across a very wide capacitance range from 0.7pF to over 10nF with <; 0.06% linearity error. The CDC senses 11.3pF input capacitance with 35.1 pJ conversion energy and 141fJ/c-s FoM.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063137","","Capacitance;Capacitive sensors;Delays;Discharges (electric);Noise;Temperature measurement","capacitance;capacitive sensors;iterative methods;power convertors;wireless sensor networks","capacitance 0.7 pF to 10 nF;capacitance 11.3 pF;capacitance sensors;charge sharing;charge transfer;complex analog circuits;energy 35.1 pJ;fully digital capacitance-to-digital converter;iterative delay-chain discharge;power consumption;ring oscillator;voltage conversion;wireless sensor system","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Class-AB operation generates a large amount of 2<sup>nd</sup>-harmonic current at the transistor output, which has amplitude as high as up to 42% of the fundamental current in theory [2]. An output matching network, providing optimum load impedance only at the fundamental frequency, is insufficient to achieve good power performance, bringing big challenges to integrated Class-AB PA design with octave bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate a 2-to-6GHz (fractional bandwidth of 115.5%) Class-AB PA designed in 65nm CMOS. An output matching technique based on differential architecture, which enables the PA to achieve a maximum PAE of 28.4% and an overall PAE above 19%, is proposed to provide transistor output with optimum load impedance for both fundamental and 2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic over an octave bandwidth.

Smart sensing using a CIS offers a variety of user interfaces and experiences such as touch-less control, authentication, gaming, and object recognition for the Internet of Things (IOT). A major drawback of a CIS in mobile devices is that it consumes power greater than 50mW [1], and this is not feasible for always-on sensing that is required to function with the limited energy available from the device's battery. Moreover, power reduction in a CIS causes image degradation owing to reduced SNR, which is not acceptable for capturing high-quality images. Many low-power CISs have been reported [2-3].

Especially when the inter-stage SAW filter is removed, FDD operation using high-order modulation schemes (as in e.g. WCDMA, LTE) demands both remarkable noise performance and linearity, which is difficult to achieve without sacrificing power consumption. On the other hand, the increased switching speed of nanoscale MOS transistors has enabled the implementation of various digital-intensive TX architectures [1-5], that improved system robustness and reduced power and area consumption even in face of decreased supply voltages. However, in these cases reconstruction filtering is hindered by direct digital-to-RF conversion, leading to increased quantization noise and strong sampling aliases. Often addressed by increasing the converter resolution [2,3,4,6] and/or sampling frequency [2], these solutions typically become rather costly and directly affect the overall power consumption. This work introduces a TX architecture that innovates by operating in the charge domain. Its incremental - rather than absolute - signaling improves both quantization noise performance and power consumption.

A small reduction in size and weight could reduce the cost of launching a satellite by a significant amount. The next generation of earth observation satellites will require data transmission rates to a maximum of 20Gb/s and at least one terabyte of storage capacity. The volume, weight, and communication speed of the processor system is determined by the backplane connectors (Fig. 20.4.1). It is difficult to achieve a connector that can pass signals of 2.5Gb/s or more. The signal reflection that occurs when signals are branched at connectors and at the wire stubs of branches decreases the transmission speed, so only point-to-point connections are possible. Once the satellite is launched, repair or replacement is not possible, and system redundancy is introduced. Accordingly, 512 backplane wires would be required. The signal connector would require 1,024pins, including the ground pins used to prevent crosstalk, and would be 512mm wide, which is even wider than the circuit board of each module.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063112","","Backplanes;Connectors;Couplers;Electrodes;Ports (Computers);Satellites;Wires","artificial satellites;avionics;coprocessors;coupled transmission lines;electric connectors;electromagnetic devices;electromagnetic wave reflection;redundancy;storage management","backplane connectors;backplane wires;bit rate 6.5 Gbit/s;crosstalk prevention;data transmission rate;downsizing;earth observation satellites;electromagnetic connector;lightening satellite processor system;mass data storage;point-to-point connection;shared bus backplane;signal connector;signal reflection;size 512 mm;system redundancy","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve high resolution (DR>90dB) and low power dissipation (FoMs>170dB), architecture selection and circuit techniques are the main design issues. In [1], a CT ΔΣ modulator embedded with a 2<sup>nd</sup>-order active filter and VGA is reported to extend the DR. However, the additional active filter results in a complicated architecture as well as extra area that is not preferred in advanced processes. An alternative method that improves the DR is to adopt the self-coupled noise-injection technique introduced in [2] to increase by one the order of the noise transfer function (NTF). Unfortunately, it requires an accurate clock cycle delay, which is only available in the DT ΔΣ modulator. Apart from DR considerations, power efficiency is still limited by the building block design. Conventional excess loop delay (ELD) compensation [1,3,4] is implemented by an inner DAC, which increases the power consumption and loads the last integrator with a large parasitic capacitance, especially for a multi-bit modulator. Therefore, a high-bandwidth opamp is required in the last integrator to alleviate the phase delay of the loop filter. Furthermore, to address the nonlinearity of a multi-bit DAC, 2<sup>nd</sup>-order dynamic element matching (DEM) is used in [5] to reduce data-dependent switching. The SFDR is still limited to 90dB. In this paper, CT self-coupling (CTSC), residual ELD compensation, and DAC linearity enhancement techniques are introduced to overcome these challenges. Our CT ΔΣ modulator achieves an SNDR of 90.4dB with an FoMs (SNDR) of 177.3dB in a 2.2MHz bandwidth.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063032","","Active filters;Bandwidth;Delays;Latches;Modulation;Noise;Power dissipation","active filters;delta-sigma modulation;energy conservation;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;modulators;operational amplifiers;power consumption;radio networks;transfer functions","CT self-coupled ΔΣ modulator;CT self-coupled delta-sigma modulator;DAC linearity enhancement techniques;DEM;DR CT ΔΣ modulator;NTF;SFDR;SNDR;VGA;active filter;analog front-end filter design;bandwidth 2.2 MHz;circuit techniques;clock cycle delay;data-dependent switching;dynamic element matching;excess loop delay compensation;high-bandwidth opamp;high-dynamic-range CT ΔΣ modulator;loop filter;multibit DAC;multibit modulator;noise transfer function;parasitic capacitance;phase delay;power 4.5 mW;power consumption;power dissipation;power efficiency;residual ELD compensation;self-coupled noise-injection technique;wireless communication applications","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In [1-2], a 1X/2X reconfigurable rectifier was reported to uphold V<sub>OUT</sub> when the coupling coils move apart. In [3], V<sub>OUT</sub> is regulated by the transmitter with feedback through a wire, which defeats the purpose of WPT. In [4], V<sub>OUT</sub> is regulated by a resonant regulating rectifier as well as an MCU-controlled transmitter with feedback still through a wire. In [5], a reconfigurable resonant regulating (R<sup>3</sup>) rectifier is reported for V<sub>OUT</sub> regulation, but the load and coupling ranges are limited.

V<sub>OUT</sub> is regulated within [V<sub>1X</sub>, V<sub>2X</sub>] by adjusting the duty cycle of mode-switching through the PWM control under the condition that V<sub>2X</sub>>V<sub>1X</sub>; otherwise, the PWM control is not stable. This restricts the workable load resistance R<sub>L</sub> to be larger than the boundary R<sub>La</sub>. For a smaller coupling factor k, R<sub>La</sub> is larger (load current is smaller), and thus the coupling range is also limited.

However, there are currently several factors that deter the implementations of fully-integrated imaging systems. Due to the lack of low-noise amplification above f<sub>max</sub>, the sensitivity of THz pixels on silicon cannot match that of its mm-Wave or light-wave counterparts. This, combined with the focal-plane array configuration adopted by previous sensors, requires exceedingly large power for the illumination sources. Previous works on silicon have demonstrated 1mW radiation [1,3]; but higher power, as well as energy efficiency, are needed for a practical imaging system. In addition, heterodyne imaging scheme was demonstrated to be very effective in enhancing detection sensitivity [4]. Due to the preservation of phase information, it also enables digital beam forming with a small number of receiver units. This however requires phase locking between the THz source and receiver LO with a small frequency offset (IF<;1GHz). In [5], a 300GHz PLL is reported with probed output. In this paper, a 320GHz transmitter using SiGe HBTs is presented (Fig. 25.5.1). Combining 16 coherent radiators, this work achieves 3.3mW radiated power with 0.54% DC-RF efficiency, which are the highest among state-of-the-art silicon THz radiators shown in the comparison table in Fig. 25.5.6.

"15.3 A 115dB-DR audio DAC with −61dBFS out-of-band noise","Westerveld, H.; Schinkel, D.; van Tuijl, E.","Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","Out-of-band noise (OBN) is troublesome in analog circuits that process the output of a noise-shaping audio DAC. It causes slewing in amplifiers and aliasing in sampling circuits like ADCs and class-D amplifiers. Nonlinearity in these circuits also causes cross-modulation of the OBN into the audio band. These mechanisms lead to a higher noise level and more distortion in the audio band. OBN also leads to interference in the LF and MF band, compromising e.g. AM radio reception. To avoid these problems, it is desired to reduce OBN power to below -60dBFS. An active low-pass filter after the DAC output can reduce the OBN power to acceptable levels, but this solution is expensive in terms of power consumption and chip area. A FIR-DAC approach implements a 1b PWM modulator, followed by a semi-digital low-pass FIR reconstruction filter. It achieves high-end audio performance with sufficiently low OBN, but the FIR structure costs area, adds latency, and (like an analog low-pass filter) inherently limits the maximum output signal frequency. Multi-bit noise shapers employ smaller quantization steps and therefore output lower OBN. A cascaded-modulator architecture can directly be followed by an on-chip amplifier without low-pass filtering. However, with only 330 quantization levels, it still cannot achieve the desired -60dBFS OBN without additional filtering. Moreover, this approach requires complex dynamic-element matching (DEM) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) shaping mechanisms. The paper present an approach that reduces OBN to below -60dBFS with minimal increase in power and area consumption. It consists of two paths . The main path is based on the work of van Tuijl et al. (2004), containing a 128× oversampled 5b 3rd-order noise shaper, thermometer decoder and real-time DEM algorithm followed by a current DAC. Since the digital noise shaper generates negligible in-band noise products, the error signal of the noise shaper is practically equal to the OBN. This err- r signal is integrated (as part of the loop filter), quantized and fed to a correction path with a differentiating DAC (DIFF-DAC). This DAC inverts the integration action, obtaining unity signal transfer. The output currents of both paths are subtracted, reducing OBN significantly. Quantization noise of the correction path is shaped because the error signal is differentiated after quantization. Depending on the shape of the noise transfer function of the main DAC, the DIFF-DAC needs an over-range in order to accommodate the increased signal swing caused by the integration action. Still, area and power cost is minimal because the range of the DIFF-DAC is still only a fraction of the main DAC range.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063033","","1f noise;Finite impulse response filters;Quantization (signal);Real-time systems;Transfer functions","audio equipment;digital-analogue conversion;intersymbol interference;low-power electronics;quantisation (signal);signal denoising","DIFF-DAC;digital noise shaper;error signal;integration action inversion;intersymbol interference;loop filter;noise correction path;noise shaping audio DAC;out-of-band noise;oversampled third order noise shaper;quantization noise;real-time DEM algorithm;signal differentiation;signal quantization;thermometer decoder;unity signal transfer","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, vibrational energy harvesters are an excellent solution to power sensors in industrial and automotive applications. This paper presents an electrostatic energy harvester (EEH) interface. Recently, electret-based EEHs have attracted considerable attention because of their capability to generate large powers, even at low accelerations [1]. Unfortunately, these devices are characterized by extremely high internal impedances and their interfacing circuits need to be simultaneously ultra-low-power and capable of working reliably with several tens of Volts applied to the input.

It is expected that solid-state lighting (SSL) will dominate general lighting in the near future. Two main challenges that must be met in SSL are the reduction of the bill of materials (BOM), and an increase in functionality. In [1], a floating DC-DC buck controller is presented. This controller adds to the BOM, as every device of the power path is discrete and the ASIC can only drive a single LED string. In contrast to that, [2] offers a high-current fully integrated power stage. However, several external passives are introduced and the technology inhibits stacking multiple LEDs for high luminous efficacy. To overcome this, [3] presents an integrated HV power path with only the inductor as an external component. Ina parallel development, [4] reports an LED driver similar to [3], but that uses a discrete Schottky diode for asynchronous rectification.

"24.3 20k-spin Ising chip for combinational optimization problem with CMOS annealing","Yamaoka, M.; Yoshimura, C.; Hayashi, M.; Okuyama, T.; Aoki, H.; Mizuno, H.","Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","In the near future, the performance growth of Neumann-architecture computers will slow down due to the end of semiconductor scaling. Presently a new computing paradigm, so-called natural computing, which maps problems to physical models and solves the problem by its own convergence property, is expected. The analog computer using superconductivity from D-Wave [1] is one of those computers. A neuron chip [2] is also one of them. We proposed a CMOS-type Ising computer [3]. The Ising computer maps problems to an Ising model, a model to express the behavior of magnetic spins (the upper left diagram in Fig. 24.3.1), and solves the problems by ground-state search operations. The energy of the system is expressed by the formula in the diagram. Computing flows are expressed in the lower flow chart in Fig. 24.3.1. In the conventional Neumann architecture, the problem is sequentially and repeatedly calculated, and therefore, the number of computing steps drastically increases as the problem size grows. In the Ising computer, in the first step, the problem is mapped to the Ising model. In the next steps, an annealing operation, the ground-state search by interactions between spins, are activated and the state transitions to the ground state where the energy of the system is minimized. The interacting operation between spins is decided by the interaction coefficients, which are set to each connection. Here, the configuration of the interaction coefficients is decided by the problem, and therefore, the interaction coefficients are equivalent to the programming in the conventional computing paradigm. The ground state corresponds to the solution of the original problem, and the solution is acquired by observing the ground state. The interactions for the annealing are performed in parallel, and the necessary steps for the annealing are smaller than that used by a sequential computing, Neumann architecture. As the table in Fig. 24.3.1, our Ising computer uses CMOS circuits to expre- s the Ising model, and acquires the scalability and operation at room temperature.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063111","","Annealing;CMOS integrated circuits;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computers;Microprocessors;Random access memory","CMOS digital integrated circuits;Ising model;annealing;combinatorial mathematics;neural chips;search problems","CMOS annealing;CMOS circuits;CMOS-type Ising computer;D-Wave;Ising chip;Ising model;Neumann architecture;Neumann-architecture computers;analog computer;annealing operation;combinational optimization problem;computing flows;conventional Neumann architecture;flow chart;ground-state search operations;interaction coefficient;magnetic spin behavior;natural computing;neuron chip;problem size;semiconductor scaling;sequential computing;state transitions;superconductivity;system energy minimization","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are 30 phases on the top edge and 31 phases on each of the other 3 edges, making 123 phases in total. The phase number and unit cell dimensions of this architecture can easily be adjusted to fit the floor plan of the load. The pads of the converter-ring are placed at the corners, and will not affect the pads of the load. Moreover, by using the proposed V<sub>DD</sub>-controlled oscillator (V<sub>DD</sub>CO), the frequency of which is controlled by varying its supply voltage, a hitherto unexplored feature of the multiphase DC-DC architecture is exposed: the control-loop unity gain frequency (UGF) could be designed to be higher than the switching frequency.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063077","","Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Regulators;Solid state circuits;Transient analysis;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;frequency control;frequency convertors;load regulation;microprocessor chips;oscillators;power grids;power supply quality;switched capacitor networks;switching convertors;voltage control","V<sub>DD</sub>-controlled oscillator;V<sub>DD</sub>CO;Vatican City;control-loop UGF;control-loop unity gain frequency;fast DVS;fast dynamic voltage scaling;fully integrated step-down switched- capacitor DC-DC converter ring;microprocessor;on-chip power grid;portable device;power supply quality;wearable device","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"11.6 A multi-channel neural-recording amplifier system with 90dB CMRR employing CMOS-inverter-based OTAs with CMFB through supply rails in 65nm CMOS","Kian Ann Ng; Yong Ping Xu","Nat. Univ. of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","Solid- State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC), 2015 IEEE International","20150319","2015","","","1","3","In addition to minimizing input-referred noise and lowering power consumption, a good multi-channel neural amplifier system should be able to significantly reject common-mode electrical interference (CMI). The dominant source of CMI comes from capacitive coupling of electrical mains supply line or EMGs onto neural tissues and can be as high as 100mV<sub>pp</sub>. Thus any neural recording setup needs a total common-mode rejection ratio (TCMRR) of at least 70dB for a minimum detectable neural signal of 5uV<sub>rms</sub>. However, multi-channel neural amplifiers are commonly implemented with a shared reference input whose input impedance is several times lower than that of corresponding signal inputs. This results in a large mismatch at the bipolar electrode-amplifier input interface. As analysed in Fig. 11.6.1, the TCMRR is significantly degraded below 70dB, independent of an amplifier's intrinsic CMRR (ICMRR). In this work, we report a micro-power, low-noise 16-channel neural amplifier that eliminates this impedance mismatch problem by using single-ended CMOS inverter-based LNAs for both the reference and signal inputs. Compared to conventional replica channel works, when operating at 1V supply, the LNAs can accommodate a large input CMI of up to 220mV<sub>pp</sub> through the use of a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop implemented through the supply rails of the CMOS-inverter-based LNAs, which coincidentally leads to a high amplifier ICMRR.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062998","","CMOS integrated circuits;Impedance;Manganese;Noise;Rails;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;biomedical electrodes;biomedical electronics;electromyography;invertors;low noise amplifiers;neurophysiology;operational amplifiers","CMFB;CMOS-inverter-based OTA;CMRR;EMG;bipolar electrode-amplifier input interface;capacitive coupling;common-mode electrical interference;common-mode feedback loop;detectable neural signal;electrical mains supply line;input impedance;input-referred noise;micropower low-noise 16-channel neural amplifier;multichannel neural-recording amplifier system;neural tissues;power consumption;signal inputs;single-ended CMOS inverter-based LNA;size 65 nm;total common-mode rejection ratio;voltage 1 V","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An example is X-ray imagers, which have been scaling both in dimension and number of sensors, today reaching millions of pixels. However, processing of the sensor data requires interfacing thousands of signals to CMOS ICs, because implementation of complex functions in LAE has proven unviable due to the low electrical performance and inherent variability of the active devices available, namely amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on glass. Envisioning applications that perform sensing on even greater scales, this work presents an approach whereby high-quality image detection is performed directly in the LAE domain using TFTs. The high variability and number of process defects affecting both the TFTs and sensors are overcome using a machine-learning algorithm known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) [1] to form an embedded classifier. Through AdaBoost, we show that high-dimensional sensor data can be reduced to a small number of weak-classifier decisions, which can then be combined in the CMOS domain to generate a strong-classifier decision.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063041","","CMOS integrated circuits;Classification algorithms;Photoconducting materials;Programming;Sensors;Thin film transistors;Training","CMOS image sensors;amorphous semiconductors;elemental semiconductors;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pattern classification;silicon;thin film sensors;thin film transistors","AdaBoost;CMOS IC;CMOS domain;LAE domain;Si;TFT;active device;adaptive boosting;amorphous silicon thin film transistor;complex functions;electrical performance;embedded classifier;glass;high dimensional sensor data processing;image detection;image sensing system;large area electronics;machine learning algorithm;weak classifier decision","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
