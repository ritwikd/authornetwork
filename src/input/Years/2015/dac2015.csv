The first one is, of course, the invention of machine learning. Statistics and optimization deliver their theories to the machine learning. The combination of the big data and the massively parallel computing enables the machines to “learn” from the data existing on the web, the network and the database, though there is only small hope that machine learning technologies help the machine to solve the design problem like design automation. Another rather inconspicuous origin is the sophistication of the traditional logical approach. The virtue of the logical approach is in its ability to express complex input-output relations, such as the mapping form natural language text to its meaning and the logical relation between a premise and its consequence, in a way that a human can understand. In this talk, I introduce AI grand challenge, “Todai Robot Project” (Can an AI get into the University of Tokyo?), initiated by National Institute of Informatics in 2011, and discuss the impact of near-term AI technologies on design automation.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059066","","Artificial intelligence;Complexity theory;Design automation;Educational institutions;Informatics;Robots;Speech","electronic design automation;learning (artificial intelligence)","AI;ASP-DAC 2015 keynote speech III;National Institute of Informatics;big data;design automation;machine learning;parallel computing","","0","","","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enable device-circuit-system co-design and optimization, a SPICE model of ReRAM that can reproduce the device characteristics in circuit simulations is needed. In this paper, we present a novel tool for ReRAM design including a physics-based SPICE model, the model parameters extraction strategy, as well as the system assessment method. This physics-based SPICE model can capture all the essential features of HfO<sub>x</sub>-based ReRAM including the DC/AC and multi-level switching behaviors, switching reliability, and intrinsic device variations. A strategy is developed to extract the critical model parameters from the fabricated ReRAM devices. A variety of electrical measurements on various ReRAMs are performed to verify and calibrate the model. The assessment method based on the experimentally verified SPICE model can be applied to explore a wide range of applications including: 1) variation-aware and reliability-emphasized system design; 2) system performance evaluation; 3) array architecture optimization.

Physical constraints can also be derived from circuit patterns or extracted layout netlists. The constraint verification is of utmost importance to guarantee the intended function of the final IC. Individual constraints often span multiple hierarchy levels, thus requiring a fully hierarchical verification approach. A novel, modular, and extensible industrial-strength approach is presented to (1) derive analog-focused design constraints from an existing circuit or extracted layout netlist, and (2) verify analog constraints such as clustering, matched orientation, matched parameters, alignment, and symmetry across multiple design hierarchy levels.

One of the major challenges in this approach is to explore the exponential-size design space composed of many tunable and interacting architectural parameters. An exhaustive search of the design space is prohibitive because of the expensive run-time of simulations. So an efficient design space exploration (DSE) strategy that can fast find the multi-objective architectural configurations (points in design space) in terms of system metrics like performance and energy is needed. In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient adaptive component selection and smoothing operator (ACOSSO) metamodel assisted NSGA-II (MA-NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique for processor DSE. We show the effectiveness of our methodology by comparing with linear regression (LR), restrict cubic splines (RCS), natural cubic splines (NCS) and artificial neural network (ANN) metamodeling techniques for processor design metrics prediction and architecture optimization.

Particularly, an untrusted manufacturer can steal the information of a design (Reverse Engineering), and/or produce extra chips illegally (IC Piracy). Among many candidates that address these attacks, Design Withholding techniques work by replacing a part of the design with a reconfigurable block on chip, so that none of the manufactured chips will function properly until they are activated in a trusted facility, where the withheld function is restored back into the reconfigurable block on chip. However, most existing approaches are ad-hoc based, and are facing two major challenges: 1) susceptibility to a category of algorithmic attacks, from attackers in a strong position, such as a manufacturer; and 2) scaling up the defense level is checkmated by the explosion of hardware cost that has to be paid at the designer's side. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme, called Entanglement, which can substantially strengthen the Design Withholding framework: 1) the algorithmic attacks are prevented by forcing the attacker to solve a huge number of problems of high computational complexity; 2) the attack cost (in terms of computational complexity) is quantitatively controllable at the designer's end, with low hardware overhead: while the cost of attack can be increased exponentially, the hardware overhead imposed on the designer's side grows only linearly. The proposed work distinguishes itself from the previous works by not relying on the difficulty of finding the solution for some NP-Complete/NP-Hard problems, but rather, on the exponentially boosted number of such problems that an attacker has to solve, while carefully maintaining the growth of the hardware overhead to be scalable via Entanglement.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059112","","Complexity theory;Hardware;Integrated circuits;Noise;Reverse engineering;Table lookup;Wires","integrated circuit design;reverse engineering;semiconductor industry","IC piracy prevention;computational complexity;design withholding techniques;low hardware overhead;reconfigurable block on chip;reverse engineering;semiconductor industry","","0","","16","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless system specification (e.g. bit error rate) for comprehensively evaluating the analog/RF front-ends is used as the optimization objective. The proposed method is implemented by linking the block-level performance metrics to the wireless system using mixed-signal simulation platform with performance modeling and Pareto optimal fronts.

This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize n bit parallel prefix adders targeting the minimization of the size of the prefix graph with log<sub>2</sub>n logic level and any arbitrary fan-out restriction. The design space exploration by our algorithm provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions for delay vs. power trade-off, and these Pareto-optimal solutions can be used in high-performance designs instead of picking from a fixed library (Kogge Stone, Sklansky etc.).

However, it also suffers from more severe reliability issues than other Non-volatile Memory (NVM) technologies. Due to the lack of access device, ReRAM cells cannot be turned off completely and thus write disturbance problem and hard errors can affect the memory array reliability. Moreover, ReRAM cell suffers from temporal variation caused by its stochastic nature, which results in the resistance change. In this paper, pseudo-hard error caused by temporal variation is defined for the first time as a unique type of error in ReRAM cross-point structure. A comprehensive model is proposed to numerically evaluate all kinds of reliability and variability issues including voltage drop, read/write disturbance, spatial/temporal variations, and hard errors. Detailed analysis are presented, and mitigation solutions including dual-port write and test-and-flip strategy are proposed to shed light on reliable ReRAM cross-point memory design.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7058990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058990","","Arrays;Mathematical model;Programming;Random access memory;Reliability;Resistance;Switches","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;random-access storage","cross-point resistive memory design;memory array reliability;nonvolatile memory;resistive RAM;temporal variation","","0","","16","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This provides flexible networking for various kinds of network usage demand. Network virtualization requires the definition of a user specific network called as “slice” and the method for programming a slice design of programmable forwarding nodes in network. The key aspect is to introduce the programmability in network. This can provide new value for users and application providers by working together with computation and peripheral technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, mobile devices and so on. Also, the delivery time of a slice can be shorter than in existing network. “Programmable Network” has huge potential to change the games in creating network service. In this talk, the R&D activities of network virtualization and its programmability methods are introduced to explain how the flexibility is realized as hardware and software system. Then, we discuss how we utilize programmable network for creating network services. The several use cases such as 4K/8K contents distribution, resiliency of network system, and edge distributed computing are introduced to show the possibility of creating new value by Programmable Network.

In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA segments. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate photodetectors (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed. They offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity and quicker time-to-results. However, current DMFB design methods target optimization in only two dimensions, hence they ignore the 3D two-layer structure of a DMFB. Moreover, these techniques ignore practical constraints related to the interference between on-chip device pairs, the performance-critical PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of devices. In this paper, we describe an optimization solution for a 3D DMFB, and present a three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR chip layout, which includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization; (ii) 3D global placement based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model; (iii) constraint-aware legalization.

Unlike traditional standard-cell based digital placement, custom-cell based digital placement may need additional manual help and intervention to achieve higher performance. The need for manual intervention is primarily due to the inability of modern analytical placers in delivering satisfactory performance on placing designs without pre-placed blocks. While most design flow works in a flat or top-down fashion, custom digital design generally works in a bottom-up fashion that there is no prior knowledge on I/O pin plan since it is changeable by the owners of modules. Without any or very few fixed I/O locations, modern analytical placers tend to produce unsatisfactory results. In this work, we propose a method, mimicking the process of making beds, to guide state-of-the-art analytical placers to deliver better placement results.

However, even though there are many works on the useful clock skew scheduling, most of them are targeted to designs with single power mode. This work addresses the problem of useful clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes, which is nowadays an essential concept for low-power designs. Precisely, we propose an optimal solution of the problem of useful clock skew scheduling for designs of multiple power modes with the objective of minimizing the number of adjustable delay buffers (ADBs) used. In addition, we solve two practical extensions: optimally allocating ADBs having quantized delay values and optimally allocating ADBs with delay upper bound. The experiments with benchmark circuits show that our proposed algorithm reduces the number of ADBs by 14.0% on average over the results produced by the conventional ADB allocation of useful clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes, and reduces the number of ADBs by 77.3% on average over that produced by the previous optimal ADB allocation of bounded clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059050","","Minimization;Resource management","buffer circuits;clocks;flip-flops;logic design;low-power electronics;scheduling","adjustable delay buffers;bounded clock skew scheduling;clock frequency;clock signal arrival times;delay upper bound;flip-flops;low-power designs;multipower mode designs;signal paths;useful clock skew scheduling","","0","","23","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, 7nm FinFET devices are designed and simulated by using Synopsys TCAD tool suite, Sentaurus. Next, 6T and 8T SRAM cells, which are composed of these devices, are designed and optimized. To enhance the cell stability and reduce leakage energy consumption, the dual (i.e., front and back) gate control feature of FinFETs is exploited. This is, however, done without requiring any external signal to drive the back gates of the FinFET devices. Subsequently, the effect of process variations on the aforesaid SRAMs is investigated and steps are presented to protect the cells against these variations. More precisely, the SRAM cells are first designed to minimize the expected energy consumption (per clock cycle) subject to the non-destructive read and successful write requirements under worst-case process corner conditions. These SRAM cells, which are overly pessimistic, are then refined by selectively adjusting some transistor sizes, which in turn reduces the expected energy consumption while ensuring that the parametric yield of the cells remains above some prespecified threshold. To do this efficiently, an analytical method for estimating the yield of SRAM cells under process variations is also presented and integrated in the refinement procedure. A dual-gate controlled 6T SRAM cell operating at 324mV (in the near-threshold supply regime) is finally presented as a high-yield and energy-efficient memory cell in the 7nm FinFET technology.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7058984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058984","","Circuit stability;Energy consumption;FinFETs;Logic gates;SRAM cells;Stability analysis","MOSFET;SRAM chips;circuit optimisation;energy conservation;energy consumption;integrated circuit design","8T SRAM cells;Synopsys TCAD tool suite;cell stability;circuit levels;cross-layer framework;deeply-scaled FinFET devices;dual gate control feature;dual-gate controlled 6T SRAM cell;energy-efficient SRAM cells;leakage energy consumption;optimization;parametric yield;process variations;size 7 nm;spanning device;voltage 324 mV","","0","","19","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inspired by the inherent data parallelism and simple data dependence in the evaluation process of HDDD, we design GPU-amenable continuous data structures to enable fast memory access and evaluation of massive parallel threads. In addition to parallelism in DDD graph, the new algorithm can naturally explore data independence existing in Monte Carlo and frequency domain analysis.

Two types of layout decomposition schemes are used to define two-dimensional layout patterns in SADP: Spacer-is-Metal (SIM) and Spacer-is-Dielectric (SID), and SIM-type layout decomposition typically has higher decomposition flexibility (especially for gridless designs). While SID-type layout decomposition has been studied extensively, however, only one previous work extended a satisfiability-based SID-type decomposer to SIM-type layout decomposition; this SAT-based method is inefficient for large-scale designs and not applicable to non-decomposable layouts. This paper introduces an efficient graph-based SIM-type layout decomposition heuristic. The decomposition problem is first transformed into a constrained set-covering problem. Then, an efficient algorithm composed of a greedy heuristic followed by a partition-based solution refinement scheme is proposed to simultaneously minimize the conflicts on both core masks and cut masks.

In order to consider design and electrical complexities (e.g., crosstalk coupling, voltage drops) as well as manufacturing and environmental variations, timing analysis is typically done using an “early-late” split. The early-late split timing analysis enables timers to effectively account for any within-chip variation effects. However, this dual-mode analysis may introduce unnecessary pessimism, which can lead to an over-conservative design. Thus, common path pessimism removal (CPPR) is introduced to eliminate this pessimism during timing analysis. A naive approach would require the analysis of all paths in the design. For today's designs with millions of gates, enumerating all paths is impractical. In this paper, we propose a new approach to effectively prune the redundant paths and develop a multi-threaded timing analysis tool called MTimer for fast and accurate CPPR.

For many designers part of the system design flow is the selection of an appropriately configured cache, a task which can be performed using cache simulators. Exploring the entire design space through precise cache simulation is a lengthy process, and while certain cache replacement policies have been optimised for fast simulation execution (such as LRU and FIFO), no effective optimisations have been proposed for an extremely effective replacement policy: Pseudo Least Recently Used tree-based, also known as PLRUt. In this paper we are the first to present a number of characteristics of the PLRUt replacement policy that lend themselves to the design of an optimised hash table-based cache simulator. We demonstrate that our optimised simulator is up to 1.93x faster than an un-optimised implementation.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059091","","Equations;Hardware;Indexes;Mathematical model;Optimization;Program processors;Space exploration","cache storage;integrated circuit design;trees (mathematics)","CPU caches;FIFO simulation execution;LRU simulation execution;PLRUt caches;PLRUt replacement policy;appropriately configured cache;cache replacement policy;cache simulators;design space;extremely effective replacement policy;hash table-based cache simulator;precise cache simulation;pseudo least recently used tree;single pass simulation;system design flow","","0","","23","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing test generation strategies for Trojan detection use controllability and observability metrics to limit the modifications targeted. However, for cryptographic hardware, the n plaintext bits are ideal for an attacker to use in Trojan triggering because the size of n prohibits exhaustive testing, and all n bits have identical controllability, making it impossible to bias testing using existing methods. Our detection method addresses this difficult case by observing that an attacker can realistically only afford to use a small subset, k, of all n possible signals for triggering. By aiming to exhaustively cover all possible k subsets of signals, we guarantee detection of Trojans using less than k plaintext bits in the trigger.

However, obtaining/specifying the current constraints remains a burdensome task for design teams. In this paper, we define and address the inverse problem: for a given grid, we will generate circuit current constraints which, if adhered to by the underlying logic, would guarantee grid safety. There are many potential applications for this approach, including various grid quality metrics, as well as power grid-aware placement and floorplanning. We give a rigorous problem definition and develop some key theoretical results related to maximality of the current space defined by the constraints.

Closed-form expressions for the transfer function, skew, and power are derived. Based on these expressions, impacts of design factors, such as the buffer size, LC tank location, grid size, wire width, and the sparsity of buffers and LC tanks, are fully explored to make trade-offs among power, skew, and area, which can be used as design guidelines for top level resonant clock mesh in early design stages.

Moreover, existing fingerprinting schemes all require redesign of the circuit which makes it prohibitively expensive for manufacturing. We develop a practical method to implement our SDC-based circuit fingerprint. First, we introduce flexibilities during the logic synthesis phase by replacing certain library cells with versatile multiplexers (MUXs). The MUX can be configured either as the original gate or one of its replacements with identical functionality except the SDC conditions. Then at the post-silicon stage, we configure these MUXs to create distinct fingerprints. We consider standard benchmark circuits and demonstrate that even on these circuits with limited size, we can find sufficient locations to embed fingerprints.

This enables us to drastically reduce the runtime while maintaining the accuracy compared to statistical fault injection.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059099","","Circuit faults;Clocks;Computational modeling;Delays;Logic gates;Transient analysis","electromagnetic compatibility;fault simulation;flip-flops;logic design;logic simulation;radiation hardening (electronics)","event-driven gate-level logic simulator;event-driven transient error propagation;fault injection;fault simulation;soft error rate estimation;soft error vulnerability assessment","","0","","27","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, each additional gate also introduces a side implementation cost. To enable more efficient digital systems, MIGFETs must leverage their expressive power to realize complex logic circuits with few physical resources. Researchers face then the question: How many gates do we need? In this paper, we address the logic side of this question. We determine whether or not an increasing number of gates leads to more compact logic implementations. For this purpose, we develop a logic synthesis flow that intrinsically exploits a MIGFET switching function. Using simplified design assumptions and device/interconnect models, we synthesize MCNC benchmarks on 5 promising MIGFET devices, with number of gates ranging from 1 to 7.

Efficient fault tolerant solutions capable of combining the advantages of static optimization and runtime adaptation are needed. To achieve this goal, we propose a static reliability-aware scheduling technique, aiming to guide runtime adaptation and relieve most of the computational overhead. The proposed static scheduler considers “reliability level” (RL) as an intermediate scheduling dimension and creates a “task-to-RL-to-core” mapping. This enables the “RL-to-core” mapping to be efficiently adapted at runtime according to fault rate variations, while the “task-to-RL” mapping can still be reused. Experimental studies show that by considering fault rates during static scheduling, runtime application execution time can be improved by up to 19% in a non-constant fault rate environment.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059076","","Dynamic scheduling;Fault tolerance;Monitoring;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Schedules","fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","aging effect;fault driven adaption;intermediate scheduling dimension;multicore systems;reliability aware static task schedule;reliability level-to-core mapping;runtime adaptation;static optimization;static reliability aware scheduling technique;task-to-RL-to-core mapping;task-to-reliability level mapping","","0","","14","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an approximation-aware scheduling framework for soft real-time tasks on the heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We consider multiple versions of a task obtained by introducing approximation in the computation to provide different levels of quality of service (QoS) versus performance tradeoffs.

This separation allows for a flexible model composition, refinement and explorations. This flexibility, however, requires dynamic dispatch during execution that degrades the simulation performance. After synthesized to a target platform, the model re-composition is no longer required. Then, the involved Dynamic Dispatch Overhead (DDO) only limits performance without providing benefits. Thus, approaches are needed for software synthesis to analyze model connectivity and eliminate the DDO wherever possible. This paper introduces a static dispatch type analysis as part of the DDO-aware embedded C code synthesis from SLDL models. Our DDO-aware software (SW) synthesis emits faster, more readable static dispatch code whenever a static connectivity is determinable. By replacing virtual functions with direct function calls, the DDO can be totally eliminated allowing for aggressive inlining optimizations by the compiler. We demonstrate the benefits of the improved SW synthesis on a JPEG encoder, which runs up to 16% faster with DDO-reduction on an ARM9-based HW/SW platform. Our approach combines the flexibility benefits in specification modeling with efficient execution when synthesized to embedded targets.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059080","","Abstracts;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Java;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Software","embedded systems;formal specification;program compilers;program diagnostics;specification languages","DDO;SLDL-synthesized embedded software;compiler inlining;component-oriented specification;dynamic dispatch overhead;static dispatch type analysis;system-level design language","","0","","20","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a major challenge of employing RM in universal memory components is the added access latency and dynamic energy consumption caused by shifts to align the data of interest with an access port. We propose multilane Racetrack caches (MRC), a RM last level cache design utilizing lightweight compression combined with independent shifting. MRC allows cache lines mapped to the same Racetrack structure to be accessed in parallel when compressed, mitigating potential shifting stalls in the RM cache. Our results demonstrate that unlike previously proposed RM caches, an isocapacity MRC cache replacement can outperform SRAM caches while providing energy improvement over STT-MRAM caches.

Motivated by that, initial work on the development of synthesis methods for optical circuits has been performed. But all approaches proposed thus far suffer e.g. from unsatisfactory synthesis results or restricted scalability. In particular, splittings in the resulting circuits which degrade the optical signals into hardly measurable fractions prevent an efficient and scalable synthesis for optical circuits. In this work, we present a synthesis approach based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) that overcomes these obstacles. The approach yields circuits that rely on a total of zero splitters - at the expense of a moderate increase in the number of optical gates.

Emerging three-dimensional (3D) stacking techniques using through-silicon vias (TSVs) promise even higher integration by combining multiple dies in a single package. In order to keep the test cost low and enhance field reliability, there is a need to re-think conventional test practices, such as test-data compression and online testing, as well as test-application techniques and fault diagnosis. Traditional hardware-based on-chip decompression solutions are limited to compression techniques that do not require large hardware overhead for decompression. However, today's system-on-chip designs (SoCs) offer resources, such as embedded processors and large amounts of fast embedded memories, that can be exploited for efficient on-chip test application, online testing, and diagnosis using software-based compression. Examples of such systems are 3D ICs with wide-I/O DRAM or traditional ICs with embedded DRAM (eDRAM). We propose a test and diagnosis solution that makes use of software-based decompression of deterministic scan-test pattern and allows for test application from on-chip DRAM to the logic die, extending traditional hardware-based methods and allowing for online scan-based test and diagnosis. This solution therefore targets SoCs that contain, in addition to a microprocessor, multiple digital-logic cores and glue logic, all of which need to be tested using scan test patterns. Simulation results for benchmarks show that we can achieve high test-data compression, comparable with what is obtained using commercial tools, as well as high-resolution on-chip diagnosis with negligible hardware and test-time overhead.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059061","","Built-in self-test;Hardware;Program processors;Random access memory;System-on-chip;Three-dimensional displays","CMOS digital integrated circuits;DRAM chips;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;logic testing;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip;three-dimensional integrated circuits;transistor circuits","3D IC;3D stacking techniques;CMOS technology;SoC;TSV;compression techniques;deterministic scan-test pattern;digital-logic cores;eDRAM;embedded DRAM;embedded memories;embedded processors;fault diagnosis;field reliability;glue logic;hardware-based methods;hardware-based on-chip decompression solutions;logic die;microprocessor;on-chip DRAM;on-chip diagnosis;on-chip test application;online scan-based test;online testing;scan test patterns;software-based compression;software-based decompression;software-based test;system-on-chip designs;test-application techniques;test-data compression;test-time overhead;through-silicon vias;wide-I-O DRAM","","0","","31","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While many off-the-shelf embedded processors employ a hybrid on-chip SRAM architecture including both scratchpad memories (SPMs) and caches, many existing work on SPM management ignore the synergy between caches and SPMs. In this work, we propose a static SPM allocation strategy for the hybrid on-chip memory architecture in a multi-tasking environment, which minimizes the overall access latency and energy consumption of the instruction memory subsystem. We capture cache conflict misses via a fine-grained temporal cache behavior model. An integer linear programming (ILP) based formulation is proposed to generate an function-level SPM allocation scheme, where both intra- and inter-task cache interference as well as access frequency are captured for an optimal memory subsystem design. Compared with the state-of-the-art static SPM allocation strategy in a multitasking environment, experimental results show that our SPM management scheme achieves 30.51% further improvement in instruction memory subsystem performance, and up to 34.92% in terms of energy saving.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059043","","Energy consumption;Memory management;Optimization;Program processors;Random access memory;Resource management;System-on-chip","SRAM chips;cache storage;embedded systems;energy consumption;integer programming;linear programming;storage management chips","ILP;access latency;cache memories;energy consumption;energy-efficient embedded systems;hybrid on-chip SRAM architecture;hybrid on-chip scratchpad memories;instruction memory subsystem;integer linear programming;multitasking embedded systems;on-chip memory management","","0","","20","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major obstacle to their widespread use in integrated systems has been the absence of a high-fidelity, physics-based, compact model describing their operation and enabling their design and verification in the same CAD environment as integrated systems or energy harvesters. In this work, we develop and validate such a model using a thorough analysis of the electrochemistry of a thin-film, solid-state lithium-ion microbattery. Our compact model is based on a behavioral linearisation step where the nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the microbattery electrochemistry are replaced with linear ones without virtually any loss in accuracy. Unlike Taylor series and other local techniques, our behavioral linearisation is global and is based on the careful examinations and validation of global electroneutrality in the thin-film, solid-state electrolyte. We then apply the well-established methodology of Arnoldi-based model-order reduction (MOR) techniques to develop a compact microbattery model capable of reproducing its input(current)-output(voltage) electrical behavior with less than 1% error with respect to the full discretised PDEs. The use of the reduced-order model results in more than 30X speedup in transient simulation.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059094","","Batteries;Cathodes;Discharges (electric);Equations;Lithium;Mathematical model;Solid modeling","electrochemistry;linearisation techniques;nonlinear differential equations;partial differential equations;reduced order systems;secondary cells;solid electrolytes;thin film devices","Arnoldi-based MOR technique;behavioral linearisation step;compact microbattery model;global electroneutrality;microbattery electrochemistry;model-order reduction technique;nonlinear PDE;partial differential equations;reduced-order model;solid-state electrolyte;solid-state lithium-ion microbattery;thin-film","","0","","13","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This keynote speech deals with the future of the automotive industry and the requirements out of new applications and technologies. The mobility of the future will be electric, automated and connected. Until 2020 the internal combustion engine will still dominate the powertrain with approximately 90% share. This includes systems with mild electrification such as start/stop. For stronger electrified vehicles like hybrids, plug-in hybrids and full EV, battery technologies and battery management are key. Automated driving is already on the way with driver assistance functions and will end up with fully automated driving. Surround sensing of cars and connection between cars and cars to infrastructure will lead to extremely high needs of computing power. Information and Communication Technology is key here. For safety functions extremely short reaction times in milliseconds are necessary. Security mechanisms to ensure proper, unimpaired operation are a must. Seamless communication from home to car and to other parts of life is expected. This leads to smart phone connectivity with the car, car with the cloud, etc.. The car will be part of the Internet. The technologies to achieve this are currently already penetrating from consumer electronics and IT technologies to cars and vice versa. E.g. MEMS, highly reliable micromechanical sensors since long utilized for automotive applications, now entered the market for consumer electronics: Bosch sensors can be found in more than every second Smartphone worldwide.

For advanced sub-10nm nodes, self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) or even self-aligned octuple patterning (SAOP) will be required. Due to considerable design complexity and unmanageable process variation, one-dimensional grid-based layout structure will be adopted, which can be achieved with sophisticated self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) process with the use of a cut mask. However, cut masks for arbitrary layouts are hardly manufacturable because cut mask rules are limited by conventional 193nm lithography. To the best of our knowledge, existing SADP- and SAQP-aware detailed routers would fail to generate cut mask-friendly routing results for general SAMP. In this paper, we propose the first work of cut mask optimization with wire planning in SAMP full-chip routing. We first identify cut mask-aware routing rules to guide our router. Then, cut mask-aware wire planning, detailed routing, and post-layout modification techniques are proposed in the routing flow.

In addition, stitches typically cause significant yield loss because of the overlay errors among different masks. As a result, leading foundries even get rid of the use of stitches in their design methodology. In order to completely avoid stitch-induced yield loss, we address the non-stitch triple patterning-aware routing problem. We observe that directly extending a state-of-the-art triple patterning-aware routing work to non-stitch routing might generate improper self-crossing nets and degrade routing quality due to sequential coloring for mask selection. To resolve these problems, we propose a new graph model to prevent self-crossing nets during routing and use a weighted conflict graph to globally consider net coloring. We then propose the first non-stitch triple patterning-aware routing scheme, which consists of two main stages: (1) conflict graph pre-coloring followed by (2) pre-coloring-based non-stitch routing. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our routing scheme.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059036","","Benchmark testing;Color;Estimation;Layout;Lithography;Routing;Wires","decomposition;graph colouring;lithography;masks","conflict graph pre-coloring model;decomposition;mask selection;nonstitch triple patterning-aware routing problem;self-crossing net;sequential coloring;stitch-induced yield loss;triple patterning lithography","","0","","21","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the NVM allocation and hierarchy optimization in high-level synthesis. A hierarchical hybrid memory architecture is presented. The proposed framework optimizes the memory hierarchy, type (NVM or SRAM) and capacity. Both an mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and a branch-and-bound heuristic are developed.

Hence, by incorporating accurately pre-characterized microcomponent power consumption values into an efficient instruction-microcomponent processor timing simulation tool, we construct a highly accurate embedded processor power analysis tool. Additionally, based on the proposed approach, we accurately and effortlessly capture the power waveform at any time point for power profiling, peak power and dynamic thermal distribution analysis.

Last two decades, a great research attention has been paid to minimizing the clock power. Recently, it is shown that the structure of resonant clock networks is very effective in saving power since it can store electric energy to the inserted inductors rather than dissipate. On the other side, it has been known that dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) is one of the most effectively and widely used power reduction techniques. However, so far no works have addressed the problem of synthesizing resonant clock networks that are able to operate under the designs with DVFS capability even though the problem is potentially very important to maximize the synergy effect on saving power. In this context, this work proposes a comprehensive solution to the problem. Precisely, we propose a two-phase synthesis algorithm: (1) formulating the problem of inductor allocation, placement, and adjustable-sizing to support DVFS into a weighted set cover problem with the objective of minimizing total area of inductors followed by (2) performing the task of resizing of adjustable driving buffers to support the switch of driving strength according to the clock frequencies by DVFS. Through experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that for designs with DVFS using 1GHz and 3GHz, our algorithm synthesizes resonant clock networks with 17% less power on the execution of the clock frequency, which is not supported by resonant clocking in the previous no-DVFS aware resonant clock synthesis algorithm.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059053","","Approximation algorithms;Capacitance;Clocks;Inductors;Radio spectrum management;Resonant frequency;Resource management","clocks;inductors;scaling circuits","benchmark circuits;clock frequency;clock power;clock resources;dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;frequency 1 GHz;frequency 3 GHz;inductor allocation;inductor placement;power reduction;resonant clock networks;two-phase synthesis algorithm","","0","","12","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The energy consumed in programming different MLC states varies significantly, thus motivating a state remapping technique to minimize the overall write energy. In this paper, we first compare dynamic and static state remapping strategies in terms of their efficacy in reducing energy, and then propose an effective and low-cost static state remapping algorithm. The experimental studies show 10.6% average (up to 16.9%) reduction in MLC PCM write energy, achieved within negligible hardware and performance overhead.

An iterative greedy algorithm is proposed to solve it, which reduces the cost and increases the estimation accuracy at the same time. The experiment shows that the linear correlation coefficient between the estimated value and real value is 0.9488. Our model can also classify PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels with a high accuracy.

Wind power development is one such example, which is growing significantly throughout the world. The main difficulty in wind power development is that wind turbines interfere with each other. The produced turbulence, known as wake effect, directly reduces the power generation. In addition, wirelength among wind turbines is not merely an economic factor, but also it decides power loss in the wind farm. Moreover, in reality, obstacles exist in the wind farm which is unavoidable, e.g., private land, lake and so on. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works consider wake effect, wirelength and obstacle-avoiding at the same time in the wind turbine placement problem. In this paper, we propose an analytical method to obtain the obstacle-avoiding placement of wind turbines optimizing both power loss and wake effect.

The end-to-end analysis of such systems, which involves accurate prediction of worst-case and stochastic eye diagrams, is a challenging problem. Existing techniques such as Peak Distortion Analysis (PDA) typically predict overly pessimistic eye diagrams because they do not take into account the coding strategies employed. Monte-Carlo methods, on the other hand, often predict overly optimistic eye diagrams, and they are also very time-consuming. As an alternative, we present BEE, an accurate and efficient computational technique that applies dynamic programming algorithms to predict realistic worst-case and stochastic eye diagrams in modern high-speed links and I/O subsystems - with neither excessive pessimism nor undue optimism. BEE is able to fully and correctly take into account many features underlying modern communications systems, including arbitrary high-level transmit-side coding schemes and strategies, as well as various low-level non-idealities introduced by the underlying channel(s), such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk, asymmetric rise/fall times, jitter, parameter variability, etc. Furthermore, BEE accurately captures the fact that different received bits typically have widely different eye diagrams when a channel is driven by correlated bitstreams generated by coding strategies. We demonstrate BEE on links involving (7,4)-Hamming and 8b/10b SERDES encoders, featuring channels that give rise to multiple reflections, dispersion, loss, and overshoot/undershoot. BEE successfully predicts actual worst case eye openings in all these real-world systems, which can be twice as large as the eye openings predicted by overly pessimistic methods like PDA. Also, BEE can be an order of magnitude faster (and much more reliable) than Monte-Carlo based eye estimation methods.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059032","","Decoding;Handheld computers;Noise;Optical wavelength conversion","dynamic programming;encoding","(7,4)-Hamming encoders;BEE;I/O subsystems;Monte-Carlo methods;SERDES encoders;arbitrary high-level transmit-side coding schemes;asymmetric rise/fall times;coding strategies;correlated bitstreams;crosstalk;dynamic programming algorithms;error resilience;high-speed links;inter-symbol interference;jitter;modern communications systems;optimistic eye diagrams;parameter variability;peak distortion analysis;pessimistic eye diagrams;realistic worst case diagrams;stochastic eye diagrams;underlying channel","","0","","10","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BTI leads to a considerable degradation of SRAM cell Static Noise Margin (SNM), which increases the memory failure rate. Since BTI is workload dependent, the aging rates of different cells in a memory array are quite non-uniform. To address this issue, a variety of bit-flipping techniques has been proposed to decrease the SNM degradation by balancing the signal probabilities of the cells. However, existing bit-flipping techniques impose too much area and power overhead as at least an additional column is required to store the inversion flags. In this paper, we propose a low cost self-controlled bit-flipping technique which inverts all bit positions with respect to an existing bit. This technique is applied to a register-file and cache units of an embedded microprocessor. Our simulation results show that the reliability of the proposed technique is similar to that of existing bit-flipping techniques, while imposing 64% less area overhead.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059010","","Aging;Arrays;Degradation;Reliability;SRAM cells;Stress;Transistors","CMOS memory circuits;SRAM chips;cache storage;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips","CMOS;SRAM cell static noise margin;SRAM memories reliability;bias temperature instability;cache units;embedded microprocessor;memory arrays;register-file;self-controlled bit-flipping;transistor aging","","0","","30","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a data is written into a memory cell, we do not write it directly but encode it into a codeword. We focus on error-correcting codes and generate new codes called write-reduction codes. In our write-reduction codes, each data corresponds to an information vector in an error-correcting code and an information vector corresponds not to a single codeword but a set of write-reduction codewords. Given a writing data and current memory bits, we can deterministically select a particular write-reduction codeword corresponding to a data to be written, where the maximum number of flipped bits are theoretically minimized. Then the number of writing bits into memory cells will also be minimized. We perform several experimental evaluations and demonstrate up to 72% energy reduction.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059055","","Computer architecture;Encoding;Error correction codes;Microprocessors;Nonvolatile memory;Vectors;Writing","error correction codes;random-access storage","bit write reduction;error correcting codes;flipped bits;information vector;memory cell;nonvolatile memory;write reduction codes;write reduction codewords;writing bits","","0","","10","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With these constraints, a clock scheduler can be used to guide the synthesis of a clock network by specifying a set of feasible arrival times at the respective sequential elements. Clock scheduling can be either static or dynamic. In static clock scheduling, a clock schedule is first specified; next, a clock network is constructed realizing the prescribed schedule. Clock trees constructed using this approach may consume significant routing resources. In dynamic clock scheduling, the clock tree and clock schedule are both simultaneously constructed and determined, respectively. In earlier studies, the scalability of dynamic clock scheduling, which is essentially a shortest path problem, has been limited. The bottleneck is in finding the shortest paths between different vertices in an incrementally changing weighted graph. In this work, we present two clock schedulers that address the scalability issues by exploiting the sparsity of this weighted graph. Experimental results show that the proposed clock schedulers are one to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a published scheduler in an earlier work. The proposed clock schedulers are scalable, and are tested on a synthesized circuit with 348 710 cells, 57 491 sequential elements, and 496 727 explicit timing constraints.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059051","","Backpropagation;Benchmark testing;Clocks;Complexity theory;Dynamic scheduling;Timing","clocks;graph theory;network synthesis;scheduling;sequential circuits","clock scheduler;explicit timing constraints;fast clock skew scheduling;sequential elements;sparse-graph algorithms;synthesized circuit;weighted graph","","0","","11","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For simplicity and ease of implementation, existing NoC power budgeting schemes, irrespective of the fact that the packet arrival rates of different NoC routers may vary significantly, treat all the individual routers indiscriminately when allocating power to them. However, such homogeneous power allocation may provide excess power to routers with low packet arrival rates whereas insufficient power to those with high arrival rates. In this paper, we formulate the NoC power budgeting problem as to optimize the network performance over a power budget through per-router frequency scaling, taking into account of heterogeneous packet arrival rates across different routers as imposed by run time traffic dynamics. Correspondingly, we propose a fine-grained solution using an agile dynamic programming network with a linear time complexity. In essence, frequency of a router is set individually according to its contribution to the average network latency while meeting the power budget. Experimental results have confirmed that with fairly low runtime and hardware overhead, the proposed scheme can help save up to 50% application execution time when compared with the best existing methods.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7058998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058998","","Analytical models;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Ports (Computers);Power demand;Runtime;System performance","dynamic programming;network routing;network-on-chip;telecommunication power management","NoC;dynamic programming network;networks-on-chip;power allocation;power budgeting","","0","","21","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we summarize two novel techniques to address this technical challenge. First, we describe a subset simulation (SUS) technique to estimate the rare failure rates for continuous performance metrics. The key idea of SUS is to express the rare failure probability of a given circuit as the product of several large conditional probabilities by introducing a number of intermediate failure events. These conditional probabilities can be efficiently estimated with a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo samples generated by a modified Metropolis algorithm. Second, to efficiently estimate the rare failure rates for discrete performance metrics, scaled-sigma sampling (SSS) can be used. SSS aims to generate random samples from a distorted probability distribution for which the standard deviation (i.e., sigma) is scaled up. Next, the failure rate is accurately estimated from these scaled random samples by using an analytical model derived from the theorem of “soft maximum”. Our experimental results of several nanoscale circuit examples demonstrate that SUS and SSS achieve significantly improved accuracy over other traditional techniques when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a few hundred.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059022","","Integrated circuit modeling;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;Probability density function;Random access memory;Random variables","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;failure analysis;integrated circuit reliability;integrated memory circuits;nanoelectronics;statistical analysis","Markov chain Monte Carlo samples;SSS technique;SUS technique;conditional probabilities;distorted probability distribution;fast statistical analysis;high-dimensional variation space;modified metropolis algorithm;nanoscale memory circuits;rare failure events;rare failure rate estimation;scaled-sigma sampling;soft maximum theorem;subset simulation technique","","0","","21","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing EM approaches using average current density or temperature, however, will lead to significant errors as shown in this work. In this paper, we propose a new physics-based EM model considering time-varying temperature and current density, which reflects a more practical chip working conditions especially for multi-core and emerging 3D ICs. We study the impacts of the time-varying current densities and temperature profiles on EM-induced lifetime of a wire for both nucleation phase and growth phase.

Energy consumers are incentivized to shape their power demands, or more specifically, schedule their electricity-consuming applications (tasks) more prudently to minimize their electric bills. This has become a particularly interesting problem with the availability of residential photovoltaic (PV) power generation facilities and controllable energy storage systems. This paper addresses the problem of joint task scheduling and energy storage control for energy consumers with PV and energy storage facilities, in order to minimize the electricity bill. A general type of dynamic pricing scenario is assumed where the energy price is both time-of-use and power-dependent, and various energy loss components are considered including power dissipation in the power conversion circuitries as well as the rate capacity effect in the storage system. A negotiation-based iterative approach has been proposed for joint residential task scheduling and energy storage control that is inspired by the state-of-the-art Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) routing algorithms. In each iteration, it rips-up and re-schedules all tasks under a fixed storage control scheme, and then derives a new charging/discharging scheme for the energy storage based on the latest task scheduling. The concept of congestion is introduced to dynamically adjust the schedule of each task based on the historical results as well as the current scheduling status, and a near-optimal storage control algorithm is effectively implemented by solving convex optimization problem(s) with polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves up to 64.22% in the total energy cost reduction compared with the baseline methods.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059015","","Energy storage;Heuristic algorithms;Minimization;Power demand;Power generation;Routing;Scheduling","computational complexity;convex programming;cost reduction;field programmable gate arrays;iterative methods;power consumption;power convertors;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;pricing;secondary cells;smart power grids;solar cells","FPGA routing algorithm;PV power generation;convex optimization problem;dynamic energy pricing;electricity consumption;electricity generation;electricity-consuming application schedule;energy cost reduction;energy loss component;energy storage Control Algorithm;negotiation-based iterative approach;negotiation-based task scheduling;polynomial time complexity;power conversion circuitries;power dissipation;power-dependent;residential photovoltaic power generation;smart grid;state-of-the-art field- programmable gate array routing algorithm;time-of-use;user electric bill minimization","","0","","14","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea is to attack the passive macromodeling problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems. As such, the proposed method can iteratively find the optimal poles and zeros for macromodeling. Our experimental results with several commercial RF circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed macromodeling method reduces the modeling error by 1.31-2.74× over other conventional approaches.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059046","","Approximation methods;Data models;Fitting;Frequency measurement;Poles and zeros;Radio frequency;Vectors","iterative methods;large-scale systems;poles and zeros;radiofrequency integrated circuits","RF circuit blocks;iterative zero/pole update;large-scale RF systems;massive macromodeling;measurement data;semi-definite programming;wireless transceivers","","0","","20","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional cycle-accurate NoC simulators need a long simulation time, as they synchronize all components (routers and FIFOs) every cycle to guarantee the exact behaviors. Also, a NoC simulation does not benefit from transaction-level modeling (TLM) in speed without any accuracy loss, because the transaction timings of a simulated packet depend on other packets due to wormhole switching. In this paper, we propose a novel NoC simulation method which can calculate cycle-accurate timings with wormhole switching. Instead of updating states of routers and FIFOs cycle-by-cycle, we use a pre-built model to calculate a flit's exact times at ports of routers in a NoC. The results of the proposed simulator are verified with NoC implementations (cycle-accurate at RTL) created by a commercial NoC compiler. All timing results match perfectly with packet waveforms generated by above NoCs (with 40-325 times speed up). As another comparison, the speed of the simulator is similar or faster (0.5-23X) than a TG2 NoC model, which is a SystemC and transaction-level model without timing accuracy (due to ignoring wormhole traffics).","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059108","","Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Routing;Switches;Timing","multiprocessor interconnection networks;network routing;network-on-chip;timing","cycle accurate timing;flit exact times;flit propagation model;many-core system;network-on-chip timing simulator;router ports;wormhole switching","","0","","19","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ease debugging during integration at system level, this paper introduces SWAT, an assertion-based debugging framework that checks and correlates system-wide interactions among HW and SW components.

On the other hand, the insertion of P/G TSVs will change the voltage of each node in the power grid, which also impacts the delays of the connected gates. Thus, it is necessary to consider the combined effect on delay variation during the P/G TSV planning. In this work, we propose a methodology using Mixed-Integer-Bilinear-Programming (MIBLP) to optimize this delay variation by a refined P/G TSV allocation.

Through silicon vias are subject to undesirable early-life effects such as protrusion as well as void formation and growth. These effects result in opens, resistive opens, and stress induced carrier mobility reduction, and consequently circuit failures. Operating the ICs under extreme temperature cycling can effectively accelerate such early-life failures and make them detectable at the manufacturing test process. An integrated temperature-cycling acceleration and test technique is introduced in this paper that integrates a temperature-cycling acceleration procedure with pre-, mid-, and post-bond tests for 3D ICs. Moreover, it reduces the need for costly temperature chamber based temperature-cycling acceleration procedures. All these result in a reduction in the overall test costs.

As a result, the patterning fidelity and variation in the template shapes is very likely to affect the final contact holes/vias. While feasible in principle, rigorous DSA process simulation is unacceptably slow for full chip verification in practice. This paper proposes a machine learning based verification that can predict the pitch size of the contact holes and the hole centers. Given a set of training data that consists of simulated template and contact hole patterns, our method is able to learn a highly accurate predictive model for pitch size and hole location. To build a statistical model for prediction, we utilize computer vision techniques to extract various geometric and image features. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of the proposed features, and compare several machine learning algorithms to achieve an effective and efficient prediction. The experimental results show that compared to the minutes or even hours of simulation time in rigorous methods, our best prediction model achieves very promising results (RMSE = 0.135 pitch grid) with less than one second of training and predicting runtime overhead.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059081","","Feature extraction;Integrated circuit modeling;Lithography;Predictive models;Shape;Training;Training data","computer vision;electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;nanolithography;nanopatterning;photolithography;self-assembly;statistical analysis;vias","DSA process simulation;RMSE;computer vision techniques;contact hole patterns;contact holes;contact pitch;contacts-vias patterning;directed self-assembly template verification;full chip verification;guiding templates;hole location;image features;immersion lithography;location prediction;machine learning algorithms;machine learning based verification;optical lithography process;patterning fidelity;pitch grid;pitch size;prediction model;predictive model;root mean squared error;self-assembly process;size 193 nm;size 7 nm;statistical model","","0","","21","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with mainstream mobile phones, wearables target one order of magnitude form factor reduction, and offer the potential of providing ubiquitous, personalized services to end users. Aggressive reduction in size imposes serious limits on battery capacity. Wearables are equipped with a range of sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Most economical sensors were developed for mobile phones, with energy consumptions more appropriate for phones than for ultra-compact wearables. This article describes the energy challenges for wearable sensing technologies, with a primary focus on the most widely used wearable sensors: MEMS-based inertial measurement units. Using sports and fitness wearables as the pilot application, we analyze the energy characteristics of MEMS IMU data sensing, analysis, and wireless communication.

However, due to its limited endurance and slow write performance, state-of-the-art solutions tend to construct a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory instead of using PCM exclusively. While existing optimizations to this hybrid architecture focus on tuning DRAM configurations to further reduce writes to PCM, we aim at developing a proactive solution. Specifically, we exploit the flexibility of mapping virtual pages to physical pages, and propose a page allocation algorithm that considers both segment information and conflict misses in DRAM to distribute heavily written pages across different DRAM sets. Trace-driven experiments confirm the effectiveness of proposed technique in reducing both DRAM misses and PCM writes, thus simultaneously improving performance and lifetime of DRAM-PCM hybrid main memory.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059057","","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Organizations;Phase change materials;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Resource management","DRAM chips;energy consumption;phase change memories","DRAM-PCM hybrid main memory;energy consumption;page allocation algorithm;phase change memory;physical pages;proactive page allocation;virtual pages","","0","","17","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A reachable set contains the union of all possible system trajectories for a set of uncertain states and as such can be used to provably check whether undesired behavior is possible or not. Our method is based on local linearizations of the nonlinear circuit, which naturally results in a piecewise-linear system. To substantially limit the number of required locations, our approach computes linearized locations on-the-fly depending on which states are reachable. We can show that without the proposed on-the-fly technique, the conversion to piecewise-linear systems is infeasible even for a few nonlinear semiconductor devices (discrete state-space explosion problem). Our method is fully automatic and only requires a circuit netlist. Piecewise-linear systems have gained popularity not only for verification, but also for accelerated simulation of nonlinear circuits. Our method provides a guaranteed bound on the number of linearization locations that have to be explicitly computed for such a nonlinear circuit.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059096","","Automata;Computational modeling;Hybrid power systems;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Nonlinear circuits;Reachability analysis","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;piecewise linear techniques;reachability analysis;semiconductor devices","automated generation;discrete state-space explosion problem;hybrid system models;linearized locations;nonlinear analog circuits;nonlinear semiconductor devices;on-the-fly technique;piecewise-linear system;reachability analysis","","0","","42","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, writing a one to a PCM cell needs longer time but less electrical current than writing a zero. In traditional PCM schemes, zeros and ones in a word are written at the same time and word write time has to be the time to write a one, thus incurring time waste. In this paper, we propose a three-stage write scheme with flip-bit for PCM main memory to reduce the number of changed bits and write latency. In our scheme, write operation is divided into comparison, write-0 and write-1 stages. In the comparison stage, new data and old data are compared and the new data is re-encoded by a flip-bit to minimize changed bits. Then the flip-bit and re-encoded data are written to PCM cells in an accelerating manner. All zero bits and one bits are written separately in later two stages to avoid the time waste in traditional write. Our scheme shrinks time consumption and reduces bit changes caused by write operation over other existing schemes. The experimental results show that this scheme decreases 43.5% bit changes, 16.6% write time and 34.6% write energy consumption on average.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059026","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Parallel processing;Phase change materials;Writing","encoding;phase change memories","PCM main memory;changed bit minimization;flip-bit;nonvolatile memory;phase-change memory;reencoded data;three-stage-write scheme;write latency;write-0 stage;write-1 stage","","0","","17","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel test clock generation scheme, namely Enhanced LCCG, for faster-than-at-speed delay testing. In the proposed scheme, faster-than-at-speed test clock is firstly generated by configuring the corresponding control information specified in the test pattern into Enhanced LCCG. Then, by constructing oscillation paths and counting the corresponding oscillation iteration numbers, the actual frequency of test clock can be measured and calculated with high resolution. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059058","delay testing;faster-than-at-speed;small delay defect","Clocks;Delays;Frequency measurement;Logic gates;Oscillators;Testing","clocks;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing","LCCG;on-chip faster-than-at-speed delay testing;on-chip generated test clock;small delay defect detection","","0","","15","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, early realizations of SET array lacked variability and reliability due to their fixed architectures and high defect rates of nanowire segments. Therefore, a reconfigurable version of SET was proposed to deal with these issues. Recently, several automated mapping approaches were proposed for area minimization of reconfigurable SET arrays. However, to the best of our knowledge, no mapping approaches that consider the existence of defective nanowire segments were proposed. Thus, this paper presents the first defect-aware approach for mapping reconfigurable SET arrays. The experimental results show that our approach can successfully map the SET arrays with 20% width overhead on average in the presence of 5000 ppm defects.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7058991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058991","","Boolean functions;Computer science;Educational institutions;Fabrics;Image edge detection;Logic gates;Single electron transistors","low-power electronics;minimisation;nanowires;single electron transistors","Moore law;area minimization;automated mapping;defect aware approach;defective nanowire segments;reconfigurable SET array;reconfigurable single electron transistor arrays;temperature 293 K to 298 K;ultra low power consumption","","0","","19","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we formulate the layout decomposition problem for this hybrid lithography as a minimum vertex deletion K-partition problem, where K is the number of masks in multiple patterning. Stitch minimization and EBL throughput are considered uniformly by adding a virtual vertex between two feature vertices for each stitch candidate during the conflict graph construction phase. For K = 2, we propose a primal-dual method for solving the underlying minimum odd-cycle cover problem efficiently. In addition, a chain decomposition algorithm is employed for removing all “non-cyclable” edges. For K > 2, we propose a random-initialized local search method that iteratively applies the primal-dual solver. Experimental results show that compared with a two-stage method, our proposed methods reduce the EBL usage by 64.4% with double patterning and 38.7% with triple patterning on average for the benchmarks.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059082","","Layout;Lithography;Minimization;Optimization;Search methods;Throughput;Ultraviolet sources","electron beam lithography;optimisation","EBL;chain decomposition algorithm;hybrid e-beam lithography;hybrid lithography;layout decomposition cooptimization;multiple patterning lithography;pattern resolution;random-initialized local search method;stitch minimization;vertex deletion K-partition problem","","0","","19","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we examine how software pipelines, which are useful for streaming/multimedia applications, can be efficiently executed on a manycore system with shared memory. The goal is to balance the stages of the pipeline under workload and resource variations. This paper presents ADAPT, a method to quickly detect bottleneck stages and add cores (workers) to those bottleneck stages at run-time. Further, if there are no idle workers, then a shuffling of workers across stages is performed to improve/maintain throughput. ADAPT is implemented in a 48-core system which is built using a commercial core and tool suite. For a variety of applications, ADAPT takes less than 2 μs for one run-time adaptation, and achieves up to 2.1× the throughput of a state-of-the-art method (which is modified and implemented in the same system for a fair comparison). These results illustrate the applicability of ADAPT for fine-grained run-time management of manycore systems to achieve high throughput for software pipelines.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059092","","Delays;Dynamic scheduling;Pipeline processing;Pipelines;Software;Steady-state;Throughput","microprocessor chips;multimedia computing;pipeline processing;shared memory systems","48-core system;ADAPT;adaptive manycore methodology;bottleneck stages;commercial core;fabrication costs;fine-grained run-time management;future on-chip manycore systems;run-time adaptation;shared memory;software pipelined applications;software pipelines;streaming-multimedia applications;tool suite","","0","","18","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the effects of both mismatch and stray capacitances depend on the specific array topology, complex calculations, custom modeling and heavy simulations in common circuit design environments are often required. This paper presents a MATLAB-based numerical tool (CSAtool) to assist the design of the charge redistribution DACs adopted in SAR ADCs. The tool performs both parametric and statistical simulations taking into account capacitive mismatch and parasitic capacitances thus computing both differential and integral nonlinearity (DNL, INL). SNDR and ENoB degradation due to static non-linear effects is also estimated. An excellent agreement is obtained with the results of circuit simulators (e.g. Cadence Spectre) featuring up to 10<sup>4</sup> shorter simulation time, allowing a large number statistical simulations which would be otherwise impracticable. Measurements on two fabricated SAR ADCs confirm that the proposed tool can be used as a valid instrument to assist the design of a charge redistribution SAR ADC and predict its static and dynamic metrics.","","978-3-9815-3704-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092585","Analog-to-digital conversion;assisted design;charge redistribution successive approximation registers ADC;numerical tools","Arrays;Capacitance;Capacitors;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Numerical models;Topology","analogue-digital conversion;circuit simulation;digital-analogue conversion;mathematics computing;statistical analysis","CSAtool;ENoB degradation;MATLAB-based numerical tool;SNDR;analog-to-digital converters;array topology;capacitive mismatch;charge redistribution SAR ADC assisted design;circuit design environments;circuit simulator;complex calculations;custom modeling;differential nonlinearity;digital-to-analog converter;dynamic metrics;feedback charge-redistribution DAC;heavy simulations;integral nonlinearity;parametric simulation;parasitic capacitances;parasitic effects;static metrics;static nonlinear effect;statistical simulation;stray capacitances;successive approximation register","","0","","","","","9-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"The end of denial architecture and the rise of throughput computing","Dally, W.J.","NVIDIA Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Design Automation Conference, 2009. DAC '09. 46th ACM/IEEE","20090828","2009","","","xv","xv","Throughput-optimized processors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) have scaled at historic rates in recent years, and continue to do so along a design trajectory that is largely unhindered by conventional dogmas and legacies. These processors recognize that two critical aspects of machine organization are key to performance: parallel execution and hierarchical memory organization. Conventional processors, which present an illusion of sequential execution and uniform, flat memory, find their performance increasing only slowly over time, and their evolution is at an end. In contrast, throughput processors embrace, rather than deny, parallelism and memory hierarchy to realize large performance and efficiency advantages. Throughput processors have hundreds of cores today and will have thousands of cores by 2015. They will deliver most of the performance, and most of the user value, in future computer systems. This talk will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities in the architecture and programming of future throughput processors, as it relates to the EDA world. First, CAD tools, flows, and methodologies are clearly crucial to the design of these processors, and these must adapt to support such designs. Second, in this changing landscape, CAD tools must need to evolve to run on throughput processors. In throughput processors, performance derives from the parallelism available from the plentiful arithmetic units, and efficiency derives from locality, overcoming restrictions stemming from communication bandwidth bottlenecks that dominate cost, performance, and power. This talk will discuss exploitation of parallelism and locality with examples drawn from the Imagine and Merrimac projects, from NVIDIA GPUs, and from three generations of stream programming systems.","0738-100X","978-1-6055-8497-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227219","","Arithmetic;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Costs;Design automation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Graphics;Parallel processing;Process design;Throughput","","","","3","","","","","26-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The amplified sEMG signal is compared to a DAC-generated threshold computed from the previous 1-bit history by custom digital control logic running at 2kHz clock and implementing an ad-hoc algorithm (Dynamic Average Threshold Crossing, D-ATC). The resulting events and the associated digitized voltage level can be both asynchronously radiated through IR-UWB. Analyzes show that the scheme is robust w.r.t. the sEMG signal variability and correlates by ~96% with regard to raw muscle force information after signal is recomputed at the RX. This paper compares D-ATC with regard to a fixed threshold system and an Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) demonstrating improved robustness, and introduces the thresholding algorithm verified on a dataset of 190 sEMG recorded signals. The applied threshold resolution has been optimized to both minimize the size of transmitted data and to guarantee good correlation performance. The paper concludes with post-synthesis results of the D-ATC compact digital control logic in a 0.18μm CMOS process, demonstrating an extremely low power consumption at very low active area expenses.","","978-3-9815-3704-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092623","","Correlation;Force;Heuristic algorithms;Muscles;Standards;Threshold voltage;Wireless communication","CMOS logic circuits;biomedical communication;digital control;electromyography;medical signal processing;signal resolution;ultra wideband communication","CMOS process;D-ATC compact digital control logic;RX;ad hoc algorithm;adaptive voltage thresholding;biomedical application;digital spike-based ultra low-power IR-UWB dynamic average threshold crossing;dynamic voltage thresholding;impulse radio ultra-wide band radio transmission scheme;muscle force wireless transmission;power consumption;sEMG signal;size 0.18 mum;surface electromyography signal;threshold resolution","","0","","","","","9-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
