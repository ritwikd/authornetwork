The progress from single-transistor to ULSI circuits has been very fast. As technology proceeded according to the well-known Moore's Law, circuit-design techniques moved more and more from analog to digital following the continuous progress made in microlithography. While there has been a corresponding huge increase in the computing power of digital circuits, this has not been accompanied by a comparable evolution in the capability of integrated circuits to interface to the external world. For free-standing computers, speed is the key factor. In other applications such as mobile phones, the interfaces with the external world are fundamental and provide the driving force in the evolution of these products. Technologies like BiCMOS, HVCMOS and BCD, which are already available and will further evolve in the future, appear to be more suitable than pure CMOS in satisfying those needs. We are moving now to SoC (System on Chip) and in the future to SiP (System in Package) techniques that will very likely include micromachined technologies. In this paper, both recent and future developments in analog interfaces will be analyzed, with particular attention given to the problem of power-consumption reduction in portable devices. As well, an overview of new applications of MEMS devices will be presented.","0193-6530","0-7803-7707-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2003.1234196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234196","","Application software;BiCMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Computer interfaces;Digital circuits;Digital integrated circuits;Integrated circuit technology;Mobile handsets;Moore's Law;Ultra large scale integration","analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;micromechanical devices","MEMS device;analog interface technology;integrated circuit;low-power design;portable device;semiconductor technology;system-in-package;system-on-chip","","2","1","","","","13-13 Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2003 IEEE International","20040226","2003","","","26","29 vol.1","In the coming ubiquitous-IT society, low-power design is one of the key features at which the VLSI designer should aim. Otherwise, power increase will remain as one of the main obstacles to Moore's law growth. Unless VLSI power is lowered by orders of magnitude, we cannot enjoy the progress that scaling offers. This talk will cover what we now have, and what we should provide in our low-power armory to allow us to cope with ever-increasing leakage loss, as well as dynamic power. The techniques to be presented range over the system, software, circuit, and device levels including interconnect and I/O issues. The novel trend is to examine cooperative approaches between levels such as software-circuit cooperation and circuit-technology cooperation. The biggest challenge that System-on-Chip designers must resolve in the future is the fact that transistors for digital and memory circuits will be more and more leaky as technology generations advance. Approaches to solving this serious problem will be described. Beyond the quest for low-power solutions lies a promising world of ubiquitous VLSI devices and products ranging from ""wireless sensors and tags for everything"" to ""everything-you-must-do mobile terminals"".","0193-6530","0-7803-7707-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2003.1234195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234195","","Batteries;Capacitance;Circuits;Delay;Energy management;Home appliances;Methanol;Power system interconnection;Repeaters;Very large scale integration","VLSI;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","VLSI design;low-power design;power-aware electronics;system-on-chip design","","34","3","39","","","13-13 Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical limits are elucidated by plotting the average power dissipation during a binary switching transition of a logic gate P versus the corresponding gate delay time t/sub d/ and the reciprocal length squared of an interconnect versus the response time of the interconnect circuit. Using both the hierarchy of theoretical limits and the history of practical limits as guides, a one-billion-transistor chip is again projected by the year 2000 and the possibility of a one-trillion-transistor chip by the year 2020 is suggested.<<ETX>>","","0-7803-0987-1","","10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=280057","","Delay;Electron devices;Integrated circuit modeling;MESFET integrated circuits;MODFET circuits;MODFET integrated circuits;MOSFET circuits;Solid modeling;Solid state circuits;Threshold current","integrated circuit technology;monolithic integrated circuits;technological forecasting","GSI;average power dissipation;binary switching transition;gate delay time;gigascale integration;interconnect circuit;logic gate;one-billion-transistor chip;one-trillion-transistor chip;practical limits;theoretical limits","","9","","15","","","24-26 Feb. 1993","24 Feb 1993-26 Feb 1993","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
