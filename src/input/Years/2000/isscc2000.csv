Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are also used but their jitter is larger than that of DLLs, because DLLs have no jitter accumulation. However, conventional DLLs have design problems. One is that their phase capture ranges are limited, and another is that a special reset sequence is required. Dual DLL architectures are developed to overcome these problems. In these architectures, the latency from the input to the output, however, is lengthened to attain high resolution, because these architectures require a number of multiplexers between the DLL input and output ports. As a result, supply-noise induced jitter increases. To reduce the jitter, a portable digital DLL uses the following techniques: (1) a master-slave architecture, which achieves infinite phase capture ranges and eliminates the special reset requirement, (2) a wave synchronous latch circuit, which maintains high resolution, and (3) a dynamic phase detector, which improves phase comparison sensitivity.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839811","","Circuits;Delay;Detectors;Jitter;Latches;Master-slave;Microprocessors;Multiplexing;Phase detection;Phase locked loops","delay lock loops;digital phase locked loops;jitter;phase detectors","1 GHz;dynamic phase detector;high-speed microprocessors;infinite phase capture ranges;latency;master-slave architecture;phase comparison sensitivity;portable digital delay-locked loop;reset sequence;resolution;signal phases;supply-noise induced jitter;wave synchronous latch circuit","","18","2","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Keys to scaling memory latency are a sum-addressed memory data cache, which allows the average memory latency to scale by more than the clock ratio, and the use of a prefetch data cache. Memory bandwidth is improved by using wave-pipelined SRAM designs for on-chip caches and a write cache for store traffic. The chip operates at 800 MHz and dissipates <60 W from a 1.5 V supply.

Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 2000 IEEE International","20020806","2000","","","378","379","Minimizing supply voltage is one of the most effective ways to attain low-power RF circuits. These 2 GHz receiver front-end blocks operate down to 0.5 V. They are a low noise amplifier (LNA), a downconversion mixer, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) fabricated by 0.2 /spl mu/m fully-depleted CMOS/SIMOX technology, which is one of the thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies. The 0.5 V operation results from using two circuit techniques. One is an LC-tuned folded Gilbert cell, and the other is the use of undoped MOSFETs in the VCO core and buffers for the mixer and VCO. SOI devices have excellent RF performance even at voltages below 1V because of reduced capacitance in the drain region compared to bulk-CMOS technologies. Moreover, fully-depleted CMOS/SIMOX technology allows undoped MOSFETs with no process steps added to the normal digital CMOS/SIMOX LSI fabrication. The undoped MOSFETs are normally-on transistors and can be made simply by masking in the channel-doping process. Thus, they have the same structure as normal (doped) ones except for the impurity concentration in their channel region. They do not show punch-through current even in short-channel devices. This is because the potential of their thin-film channel region is perfectly controlled by the gate.

If clock frequency and supply voltage are dynamically varied in response to computational load demands, then energy consumed per process can be reduced for the low computational periods, while retaining peak performance when required. This strategy, which achieves the highest possible energy efficiency for time-varying computational loads, is called dynamic voltage scaling (DVS).","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839787","","Batteries;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy efficiency;Frequency;Handwriting recognition;High performance computing;Microprocessors;Portable computers;Time varying systems","low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","design;dynamic voltage scaling;energy efficiency;microprocessor;portable electronic device;time-varying computational load","","97","11","3","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using memory cells as the reference cells provides an optimum reference voltage level, which automatically tracks the main memory cell properties. However, when memory cells are used as reference cells, the reference cells experience more access cycling than normal cells. Therefore, the endurance of the FRAM devices is determined by reference cells rather than by normal cells. Another issue is that, when the memory cells are used as reference cells, reference voltage level fluctuation cannot be avoided, especially in high-density FRAM, because variations of PZT film grain size and dimensions of the capacitor become serious. A variable reference bit line voltage scheme overcomes these problems. Unfortunately, the reference bit-line voltage scheme is not useful for all memory cells, because the reference voltage level is determined by a limited number of cells, not by all memory cells. This bit-line reference scheme is optimized with all of the memory cell charge information. Data protection is also used for unintentional power-off. An optimum read pulse width is suggested for high-speed FRAM.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839781","","Capacitors;Circuits;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;Protection;Pulse measurements;Random access memory;Space vector pulse width modulation;Timing;Voltage","ferroelectric storage;integrated memory circuits;protection;random-access storage;reference circuits","3.3 V;4 Mbit;FRAM devices;PZT;PZT film grain size;PbZrO3TiO3;capacitor dimensions;charge distribution;data protection circuit;fixed bit-line reference voltage scheme;high-density FRAM;high-speed FRAM;memory cell charge information;memory cell properties;memory cells;nonvolatile ferroelectric RAM;optimum read pulse width;optimum reference voltage level","","7","3","2","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low power consumption and low cost are also essential for consumer applications. These requirements are supported by multi-channel transmission, such as four 5 Gb/s CMOS LSIs, which is an effective approach to achieving an aggregate bandwidth of 20 Gb/s. There are two system problems in developing a multi-channel transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) LSIs. One is the phase difference between multiple chips due to the data skew caused by differences between transmission cable lengths. The other is the frequency difference between the TX and RX system clocks. In response to these problems, we have developed compensation technology featuring the use of an elastic buffer for both the phase and frequency differences. Moreover, to achieve 6 Gb/s operation, a self-alignment phase detector with parallel output for a high-speed clock and data recovery circuit (CDR) and a 500 MHz fully pipelined 8B10B encoder are developed.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839776","","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Clocks;Communication cables;Costs;Data communication;Energy consumption;Flat panel displays;Frequency;Transmitters","CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital instrumentation;flat panel displays;large scale integration;receivers;transmitters","20 Gbit/s;2400 pixel;3200 pixel;500 MHz;CMOS LSI;compensation technology;digital display interface;elastic buffer;high-speed clock and data recovery circuit;multi-channel transmission;pipelined 8B10B encoder;receiver;transmitter;ultra-high-resolution flat panel display","","9","3","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing SO techniques require isolating the opamp from the signal path by turning off completely either the entire opamp or its output stages after the integration phase. As a result, these SO techniques cannot be applied to realize the useful SC pseudo-N-path filters, which require an idle phase in the system for further signal processing. A modified SO technique implements an additional switchable opamp in parallel with the original switchable opamp but working in an alternative clock phase. As such, for every clock phase, there exists an opamp that is fully functional in the SC system. With the two switchable opamps both realized in a two-stage approach, it is sufficient to turn off only the output stages to isolate the signal path. The two switchable opamps are further combined to realize a single two-switchable-output-pair opamp to save power and area and to minimize the mismatch. To demonstrate the idea, a 1 V fully differential two-switchable-output-pair opamp is realized in a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process with nMOS and nMOS threshold voltages 0.66 V and /spl sim/0.85 V respectively.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839728","","CMOS process;Clocks;Filters;Low voltage;MOS devices;Signal processing;Switched capacitor circuits;Switching circuits;Threshold voltage;Turning","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;band-pass filters;low-power electronics;operational amplifiers;switched capacitor filters","1 V;CMOS process;SC pseudo-2-path filter;SC pseudo-N-path filters;alternative clock phase;fully differential;low voltage supply;modified switched-op amp technique;single two-switchable-output-pair op amp;two-stage approach","","3","2","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This 64 Mb 4-level cell (2b/cell) flash memory device uses a triple-metal triple-well p-bulk 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS process featuring shallow trench isolation (STI) for denser memory array packing. The device (programming channel hot electron injection, erasing Fowler-Nordheim tunneling) is organized in 64 identical sectors (512 rows by 1024 columns) with a NOR architecture. Data input/output (I/O) can be selected (16 or 32). A dedicated pad supplies the I/O buffers to allow direct interfacing to external low voltage (i.e., 1.8 V) devices, as is required in most portable applications. The pull-up p-channel transistor in the output buffer is driven with a negative-bootstrapped voltage to provide adequate drive capability at low supply voltage (switching time is 10 ns with a 50 pF load at 1.8 V). All high voltages needed for memory operation (programming, erasing, and reading) are generated on-chip by charge-pump voltage multipliers, starting from the single 3 V supply. Reading can be both in asynchronous mode (130 ns access time) and in burst mode. For the latter, continuous and pipeline modes are provided, with up to 50 MHz data rate and different data output latency and burst size. Both sequential and interleaved data output is available. To achieve sufficiently tight threshold voltage distributions, stair-case-gate voltage programming and program and verify techniques are used.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839782","","Charge pumps;Decoding;Error correction codes;Flash memory;Integrated circuit modeling;Low voltage;Research and development;Threshold voltage;Throughput;Writing","CMOS memory circuits;NOR circuits;PLD programming;flash memories;redundancy;tunnelling","0.18 micron;3 V;50 MHz;64 Mbit;NOR architecture;NOR-type flash memory;charge-pump voltage multipliers;continuous mode;erasing Fowler-Nordheim tunneling;four-level memory cell;interleaved data output;memory array;multilevel storage approach;p-bulk CMOS process;pipeline mode;programming channel hot electron injection;sequential data output;shallow trench isolation;stair-case-gate voltage programming;threshold voltage distributions;triple-metal triple-well process","","5","4","2","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 2000 IEEE International","20020806","2000","","","158","159","An optical receiver front-end for SONET OC-48 (2.5 Gb/s) is shown. The limiting amplifier (LA) receives a small-non-return to zero (NRZ) voltage signal (e.g., 8 mV/sub pp/) from the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and amplifies it to a level (e.g. 250 mV/sub pp/) sufficient for the reliable operation of the clock and data recovery circuit. The noise contribution of the LA must be small compared to that of the TIA so that the overall bit error rate and sensitivity are not affected adversely. Currently, commercial 2.5 Gb/s SONET systems are composed of several discrete chips implemented in GaAs and more recently silicon bipolar technology. The future trend, however, is to integrate most of the front-end together with the digital framer on a single CMOS chip. Furthermore, the integration of multiple 2.5 Gb/s channels on a single CMOS chip is desirable for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) application. CMOS amplifiers for optical receivers and related applications with bandwidths up to 2.1 GHz are recently reported. This CMOS limiting amplifier with improved bandwidth (3 GHz) and noise figure (16 dB) is suitable for 2.5 Gb/s SONET receivers. Power dissipation is 53 mW and the chip is fabricated in a standard 2.5 V, 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. This result is achieved with: (i) Inverse scaling to increase gain-bandwidth and reduce power dissipation while keeping noise and offset voltage low and (ii) active inductors to increase gain-bandwidth and improve gain stability.

The computing power needed from several tens of millions transistors at high clock rates requires new approaches simultaneously to allow maximum performance and minimum leakage current. Revived conversion principles like direct downconversion start to be seen in volume production. These concepts put most selection into baseband, avoiding a SAW filter and drastically reducing the number of RF blocks. Power amplifiers still use expensive GaAs HBTs. New concepts will improve power-added efficiency and give GaAs a push. For low-transmit-power applications, silicon PAs with higher performance and lower cost soon will be feasible. MEMS technologies will allow integration of mechanical antenna switches as well as other discrete RF circuitry. The remaining discretes will be integrated by advanced packaging technologies such as subsystem assembly, multi-chip or system module packages.

Using copper and wider wires for major signal and power/ground lines, inductive impedance (j/spl omega/L) could become comparable to the resistive component of the wire (R). Due to the inductance, delay increases, over-shoot occurs, and inductive crosstalk can no longer be ignored. Inductive effects were recently demonstrated in 4 mm-long lines in a 0.25 /spl mu/m process. The extracted delays of a typical clock line from this test chip are shown. While the delay is a linear function of line length, the RC delay increases with the square of the line length. As a result, the inductive effects are actually more prominent for lines with intermediate lengths. The inductive effects for the intermediate length buses as well as local clocks must be considered. As technology is scaled, the gate delay time will continue to be reduced while the delay of short, low-resistive clock lines will remain constant. The inductive effects will therefore become prominent for progressively short lines. The article shows simulated inductance effects on crosstalk. Larger coupling and ringing effects are observed when inductive coupling is included in the simulation. Currently, the inductive effects are only considered for a few global clocks and buses, which is insufficient for future designs. Although 3D electromagnetic full wave solvers are available, they cannot manage the complexity of today's integrated circuits. To model the inductive effects of intermediate-length buses as well as local clocks, a fast automated inductance extraction and verification tool is necessary.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839736","","Clocks;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Frequency;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Power transmission lines;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;crosstalk;delays;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;wiring","3 to 8 mm;RC delay;VLSI interconnects;gigahertz frequencies;inductance extraction;inductance verification tool;inductive coupling;inductive crosstalk;inductive impedance;interconnect wires;linear function;local clocks;low-resistive clock lines;on-chip inductance modeling;power/ground lines;resistive component;ringing effects;transmission line behavior","","12","2","3","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we enter the new millennium, devices are being fabricated using processes managed at atomic levels while IC design involves detailed systems engineering, including direct consideration or even incorporation of application content. By attempting to leverage that entire chain of associated technologies, ever more powerful end-user functionality is enabled, e.g., mobile information access at the most practical costs, power levels, and form factors. Underlying this revolution is that on-chip interconnect is cheaper than going off-chip and the cost of nearly any component on a chip has been consistently reduced 20-30% per year. Additionally, the corresponding improvements in overall system power dissipation, miniaturization, and I/O bandwidth have driven integration of what once were considered distinct technologies, e.g., logic, analog, memory, and RF. While the vision of completely monolithic systems is practical, a level of analysis much more complex than that for the homogeneous CMOS IC is required to justify appropriate directions. Looking further forward, exponential improvements clearly cannot continue forever, and limitations may arise from a variety of interrelated sources-physics, economics, complexity of the task, or lack of applications.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839678","","Application specific integrated circuits;Content management;Cost function;Design engineering;Engineering management;Power engineering and energy;Power system interconnection;Power system management;Silicon;Systems engineering and theory","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit economics;integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics","I/O bandwidth;IC design;application content;economics;end-user functionality;form factors;mobile information access;on-chip interconnect;power levels;system power dissipation;systems engineering","","2","","13","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In CPL, the clock signals serve as a source of ac power for the large on-chip capacitive loads. By exploiting adiabatic charging and an energy conserving clock driver, it is possible to build ultra-low-power CMOS processors with this approach. Previously, a CPL processor was demonstrated in a 0.5 /spl mu/m n-well CMOS process. Laboratory measurements confirmed that it was possible and practical to recover and reuse large amounts (upwards of 80%) of the on-chip capacitive energy for a 16 b pipelined general-purpose CMOS processor. The measurements and simulation data analysis also pointed out some of the shortcomings of the original design approach which limited the speed, voltage scalability, and robustness of the processor.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839788","","Buildings;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS process;Clocks;Displays;Graphics;Laboratories;Logic design;Microprocessors;Very large scale integration","CMOS digital integrated circuits;VLSI;display instrumentation;embedded systems;low-power electronics;microcontrollers;microprocessor chips","0.5 micron;15.8 MHz;16 bit;2.9 mW;CMOS VLSI graphics microprocessor;adiabatic charging;clock-powered logic;embedded display controller;low-power system","","4","2","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multi-bit /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators are the preferred choice for converters achieving high performance, especially in DACs. Compared with continuous-time, current mode DACs, a SC architecture provides significantly higher clock-jitter tolerance and eliminates inter-symbol interference. The performance of conventional 1 b SC DACs is limited by severe post-filtering needs and constrained signal swings due to poor modulator stability. The relaxed filtering needs and better modulator stability of a multi-bit approach make the multi-bit DAC an attractive alternative. However, nonlinearity caused by sampling element mismatch must be overcome to produce a low-distortion device. Second-order dynamic element matching (DEM) is used to address the nonlinearity issue. The second-order DEM technique used here is an improvement on the second-order data weighted averaging (2DWA) DEM technique reported previously. The DAC using this DEM achieves 100 dB THD and -120dB integrated noise over 20 kHz band. The 9.4 mm/sup 2/ chip is fabricated in a 0.35 /spl mu/m DPTM CMOS process.

A matched filter like this can be viewed as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter with a PN sequence used as the binary tap weights, minimizing search and synchronization times in DS-CDMA receivers. This paper introduces an approach for implementing matched filters based on recycling integrator correlators (RICs) that use a sensible combination of analog and digital processing to minimize area and power consumption. The matched filter is organized by combining an array of RICs, a cyclic shift register which stores a PN sequence, and a rotary multiplexer which transfers the correlation values one by one. This implementation provides: 1) an input analog signal processing capability without the need of a fast ADC; 2) an already digitally-coded output stream; 3) small capacitor ratios for the switched-capacitor (SC) integrators; and 4) minimum die-area and current consumption for the available technology and the spreading ratio, that is, the length of the PN sequence.

For AM, over 20 channels pass through this filter, resulting in high dynamic range of the IF signal.

In this configuration, the analog signal from the CCD must be driven across a flexible cable to the main board, where analog pre-processing is performed. In previous camera generations, the challenge was simply to integrate all of the analog functions onto a single CMOS chip compatible with low voltage supplies. This results in low-cost low-power system partitioning now widely used for consumer CCD camera systems. As consumer CCD sensors move toward higher resolution, however, this conventional integration has weaknesses.

Many fast serial transceivers have been published in this field, but they are rather large, noisy and/or power hungry for embedded applications, especially in a mixed-signal environment. For short-distance communication, phase-locked clock recovery and oversampling, are quite 'expensive' techniques for data recovery and synchronization, resulting in fixed wordlengths protocols and limited flexibility. Interchip interconnect research focuses on driver techniques and throughput per pin. Serial transfer of parallel data and synchronization issues are not discussed. The solution presented in this paper is simple, robust and flexible and has low electromagnetic interference (EMI). This makes it especially suitable for data busses between AD/DA converters and a microprocessor or DSP, although it can be applied for other bus types as well. While a prototype is implemented in standard 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS, the concept can be used in many technologies and is future-proof, regarding signaling levels and circuit techniques.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839771","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Electromagnetic interference;Integrated circuit interconnections;Protocols;Robustness;Synchronization;Throughput;Transceivers;Working environment noise","CMOS integrated circuits;data communication equipment;electromagnetic interference;embedded systems;integrated circuit interconnections;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","CMOS;data busses;electromagnetic interference;embedded applications;high-speed serial interfaces;inter-IC serial data link;interconnect bandwidth;signaling levels","","5","2","7","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For these reasons, use of continuous time filters for this application is gradually diminishing. Efficient timing recovery in a read channel is critical for fast phase and frequency acquisition in addition to acceptable bit error rate (BER) performance. Therefore, it is also critical that these filters are implemented with as little latency as possible since their output is used to extract timing information.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839700","","Bit error rate;Delay;Digital filters;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency;Information filtering;Information filters;Least squares approximation;Magnetic recording;Timing","FIR filters;magnetic recording","FIR digital filter;PRML equalization;bit error rate;least mean square algorithm;magnetic recording read channel;signal spectral shaping;timing recovery","","1","","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the use of full-duplex transmission over four pairs (due to CAT-5 100 MHz bandwidth limitations), this approach requires echo and near-end cross-talk (NEXT) cancellation. The monolithic integration of this system is challenging. An alternative approach is to use Category-6 cables which offer a bandwidth specified up to 250 MHz. This work is based on full-duplex 1 Gb/s transmission on 4 pairs of CAT-6 cabling, where each pair is used in uni-directional fashion (2 pairs 500 Mb/s transmit, 2 pairs 500 Mb/s receive, avoiding the need for echo cancellation. The measured frequency response of a CAT-6 cable compared to CAT-5 is shown (both are scaled to worst-case envelopes). The line code chosen here is the same as in the 1000BASE-T standard, 5-level PAM modulation, but at twice the baud-rate (250 M baud instead of 125 M baud) thus achieving 500 Mb/s on each pair instead of 250 Mb/s as in CAT-5. The paper shows the overall system block diagram.

The digital filter solution has good static selectivity, but discontinuity in bandwidth control limits its perceived dynamic selectivity. This integrated time-continuous adaptive filter has instantaneous bandwidth determined by all relevant system parameters.

The majority of jitter in a clock tree is introduced by buffers and inter-line coupling to the clock wires. A relatively small amount comes from noise in the source oscillator. This distributed clock network generates the clock signal with phase locked loops (PLLs) at multiple points (nodes) across a chip, and distributes each only to a small section of the chip (tile). Phase detectors (PD) at the boundaries between tiles produce error signals that are summed by an amplifier in each tile and used to adjust the frequency of the node oscillator.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839737","","Clocks;Delay;Jitter;Microprocessors;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Signal generators;Tiles;Wires","clocks;delays;digital phase locked loops;phase detectors;timing jitter","active gigahertz clock network;balanced tree;buffers;clock speeds;clock tree;distributed PLLs;error signals;gate delay;inter-line coupling;interconnect delay;jitter;node oscillator;phase detectors;random variations;skew;source oscillator","","5","2","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, resonant circuits that provide a clock shaped power supply required by adiabatic circuits and exhibit negligible internal dissipation, are difficult to achieve. The problem is aggravated by the fact that most proposed adiabatic circuit families require multiple-phase clocking. The second issue is related to the design of sequential adiabatic logic circuits which typically trap charge in their internal nodes making a relatively large fraction of delivered energy unavailable for recovery.

In these high-speed systems, the jitter and phase difference of the DLL or PLL are critical in determining system operating frequency. The phase-locked loop (PLL) and delay-locked loop (DLL) are widely used to eliminate the clock skew in synchronous DRAM, Rambus DRAM, serial-link and high-speed interface applications. However, it is difficult to obtain both low jitter and adequate lock-on time using conventional DLL and PLL architectures because the analog DLL and PLL can generate a low-jitter clock signal with a narrow loop bandwidth at the expense of long lock-on time. The DLL and PLL still have non-negligible phase difference between reference and internal clocks. The phase difference comes from the mismatch between the charge and discharge current caused by V/sub DS/ difference in Charge Pump (CP) when the loop is locked. As an alternative, many open loop delay-line clock synchronization circuits such as SMD and RDL are used for SDRAM application because of lock-on in only 2 clock cycles. However, their phase difference (maximum phase difference=unit delay of delay line) is relatively large compared to that of the PLL or DLL.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839812","","Bandwidth;Charge pumps;Circuits;Clocks;Delay lines;Frequency synchronization;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Random access memory;Signal generators","clocks;compensation;delay lock loops;synchronisation","330 MHz;DLL;charge current;clock cycles;clock frequency;discharge current;fast-locking direct skew compensation;high-speed systems;lock-on time;narrow loop bandwidth;open loop delay-line circuits;phase difference;source synchronization;system operating frequency","","1","1","3","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overall receiver must have a bandwidth of 6.5 GHz to avoid intersymbol interference (ISI) but must meet the minimum sensitivity requirement which ranges from -12 dBm for short-haul communication to -24 dBm for long-haul communication at BER of 10/sup -12/. For long-haul communication, the minimum photocurrent is approximately 40 /spl mu/A/sub p-p/ if an avalanche photodiode with 0.5 A/W responsivity and a gain of 10 are assumed. Then, the rms noise current referred to the input of the receiver should be less than 2.85 /spl mu/A for BER of 10/sup -12/. This includes a noise contribution from the photodiode, transimpedance amplifier, and limiting amplifier. Typically, the photodiode and transimpedance amplifier dominate the receiver noise. Thus, the rms noise voltage contributed by the limiting amplifier should be much less than 2.85 mV if the transimpedance amplifier has 1 k/spl Omega/ gain.

These implementations tend to be large in area and high in power. In addition, the large amount of digital logic switching at high speeds can lead to EMI issues. Finally, since a finite resolution must be chosen in a DSP implementation, noise immunity is reduced due to quantization noise. This chip uses mixed-signal techniques to implement the DFE and FFE functions of a 100BASE-TX receiver. The 100BASE-TX receiver uses a switched-capacitor, fixed coefficient FFE to cancel precursor ISI and create the timing function, a mixed-signal current-summing fully adaptive DFE to cancel post-cursor ISI, a fast offset cancellation tap to cancel baseline wander, and a coarse comparator to make decisions. Timing information, extracted from the received signal, is input to a digital signal processing (DSP) engine which emulates a second-order phase-locked loop (PLL) function. The function includes both proportional and integral representations of the timing information. A phase-interpolating PLL generates the recovered clock from the output of the DSP engine.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839794","","Digital signal processing;Digital signal processing chips;Electromagnetic interference;Engines;Intersymbol interference;Logic;Noise cancellation;Noise reduction;Phase locked loops;Timing","comparators (circuits);digital phase locked loops;electromagnetic interference;local area networks;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;quantisation (signal);receivers;switched capacitor networks;timing","100Base-TX applications;DSP engine;EMI issues;baseline wander;coarse comparator;integral representations;mixed-signal DFE/FFE receiver;mixed-signal current-summing fully adaptive DFE;mixed-signal techniques;offset cancellation tap;phase-interpolating PLL;precursor ISI;proportional representations;quantization noise;recovered clock;second-order phase-locked loop;switched-capacitor fixed coefficient FFE;timing function","","8","29","4","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The measured S11 is <-11.5 dB between 1.725 GHz and 1.975 GHz, satisfying the antenna filter requirement (S11 <-10 dB). The lower input impedance improves the LNA gain by about 1.5 dB compared to an exact 50 /spl Omega/ match. An on-chip load inductor centers the gain at 1.84 GHz. Each down-conversion mixer uses a cascoded, current-folding switching mixer. This permits low voltage operation while enabling the insertion of a cascode transistor to improve LO leakage and mixer linearity.

Variable L/sub G/ leads to variable current drive, requiring conservative digital designs, and to device mismatch that makes the fastest transistors unusable in precision analog designs. The vertical, replacement-gate (VRG) process uses the thickness of a deposited film to precisely define the gate length, while preserving the small gate overlap capacitances and shallow, self-aligned source/drain extensions that are critical to modern MOSFETs. In brief, a silicon device pillar is grown through a multilayer sandwich, whose center layer is later removed and replaced by the gate, and whose upper and lower layers provide dopants for the source/drain extensions. The gate dielectric can be thin, high-quality, thermal SiO/sub 2/ grown on [100]-oriented single-crystal silicon. Previous vertical MOSFET schemes inherently result in poor gate length control, high gate overlap capacitances, or low-quality gate oxides.

While the design is based on a traditional multi-stage architecture, the three encoder stages use serial-ripple converters. Unlike the typical N-bit flash converter which requires 2-/sup N-1/ comparators, the serial-ripple converter has only N comparators. The result is a smaller die area and lower power dissipation than flash. This design uses a total of 16 comparators, and at the full sample rate consumes 1250 mW.

Matching algorithms implemented in software cannot keep up with ever-increasing data rates. Brute force comparison hardware is infeasible. To support 500 five-dimensional rules, at 4Mpackets/s throughput, 20B comparisons/s are needed.

Previous baseband signal processors for digital cellular communications integrate only the digital functions, while the baseband data conversion functions reside in a dedicated analog CMOS IC or are merged with the IF functions in a BiCMOS IC. However, analog processes typically have feature sizes that are generations behind digital CMOS. Since even data conversion functions need a variety of digital circuits such as digital filters for voiceband processing, /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ decimation, and various random logic for decoding and register file control, the use of older analog processes leads to larger area and power in addition to the extra package cost. Moreover, chip-to-chip communication consumes power and creates unnecessary board noise. Thus, it is desirable to integrate the analog functions with the digital signal-processing elements to take advantage of the rapid advances in digital CMOS and the integrated form factor. Due to the difficulty of mixed-signal integration, there is no previous report of successful integrated mixed-signal baseband processors that have gained type-approval and gone into high-volume production.

This results in a higher output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to conventional analog signal processors.

The relative weighting of the voltages added is usually adjusted by trimming the ratio of two resistors. Although inexpensive resistors of suitable values are available in analog CMOS processes, the area of such resistors is increased in standard digital processes because silicide is often used to reduce the sheet resistance of the polysilicon and diffusion layers. As a result, the length and area of the required resistors is increased, increasing not only the cost, but also the susceptibility of the reference operation to substrate noise coupling. One way to overcome this problem is to use an extra mask to selectively block the silicide, but this mask also increases the cost. This paper presents a circuit solution to the above problem: a bandgap reference without resistors. It uses only MOS transistors biased in saturation or cutoff. The devices biased in saturation operate in strong inversion, for which accurate device models are usually available, simplifying the design process, especially in digital CMOS technologies.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839852","","CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuit noise;Costs;Diodes;Photonic band gap;Resistors;Silicides;Temperature;Voltage","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;reference circuits","CMOS bandgap reference;MOS transistors;cutoff;device models;diffusion layers;forward bias voltage;mask;proportional to absolute temperature;reference operation;relative weighting;saturation;sheet resistance","","12","","2","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2000 IEEE International","20020806","2000","","","168","169","For clock generation and clock recovery, charge pump phase-locked loops (CPPLLs) are widely employed inside ICs since they can be integrated on a standard CMOS process and have the ability to remove DC phase offset with just a passive loop filter. However, owing to complex loop characteristic and precision required for analog blocks, the design is not simple. All digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) achieved 50-cycle acquisition time by sweeping the whole tuning range through a modified binary search. Due to a fixed sweeping algorithm, acquisition time is independent of VCO free-running frequency. Also, adaptive gear-shifting phase-locked loop (AGPLL) brings acquisition time within 40 cycles by adjusting the loop bandwidth proportional to the input phase differences. In spite of poor jitter performance, digital implementations have started to draw more attention since they yield better testability, programmability, stability, and transplantation over various processes. In this work the authors present a digitally controlled phase-locked loop (DCPLL) which reduces acquisition time by utilizing a digital frequency-difference detector (DFDD). Whereas the arbiter of the ADPLL generates only binary results of 'fast' or 'slow', the DFDD supports the functions of measuring frequency difference and an arbiter. Thereby, the DCPLL acquisition time is reduced compared to that of the ADPLL, while its locking performance remains independent of free-running frequency. A prototype DCPLL has been implemented in a 0.6 /spl mu/m triple metal CMOS process.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839734","","CMOS process;Charge pumps;Clocks;DC generators;Digital control;Frequency;Passive filters;Phase locked loops;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;detector circuits;digital phase locked loops;jitter;timing circuits","0.6 micron;acquisition time;clock generation;clock synthesis application;digital frequency-difference detector;digitally controlled PLL;fast locking scheme;locking performance;phase-locked loop;triple metal CMOS process","","8","3","3","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This imbalance requires memory systems to use a wide data-bus and/or a high-speed I/O interface to increase access speed. Increasing access speed with a wide data-bus is studied, but is practically limited by memory pin counts. Alternatively, Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) achieves access speed up to 800 MB/s in a well-controlled printed circuit board (PCB) environment by adopting a high-speed I/O interface. Low cost systems use synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) interface because they cannot afford a high-cost PCB. This system limits memory access speed to the system clock speed, which is commonly less than 100 MHz. Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM, is twice as fast as SDRAM memory access by taking both rising and falling edges of the system clock, while keeping the SDRAM interface.

In the forward direction, dedicated Valid signals emulate the worst-case path through each driving block and thus determine when data can be latched within the typical block. In the reverse direction, Acknowledge signals indicate that data has been received by the subsequent blocks and that new data may be processed within the typical block.

Unfortunately, RF performance of the architecture is severely limited by second-order nonlinearities which in the past have narrowed its application to low-spec transceivers. This is due to limited selectivity preceding the downconversion mixer which allows any two signals inside of the preselector bandwidth, whose difference in frequency is less than the signal bandwidth, to generate a distortion component at baseband through a second-order nonlinearity.

Experiments reveal a major weakness in passive pixels is a signal-dependent parasitic current that can contaminate charge signals in different parts of the array. The origin of this parasitic current is explained here.

ISSCC. 2000 IEEE International","20020806","2000","","","42","43","Conventional pipelined ADCs with redundancy and digital correction have linearity limited by the gain accuracy of the interstage amplifiers or the linearity of the D/A subconversions. With a fully differential 1.5 b/stage architecture, the D/A subconverters can in principle be inherently linear, and the main limitation stems from the interstage gain accuracy. Besides the error caused by finite-op-amp gain and capacitor mismatch, the linear portion of the incomplete op-amp settling can also be modeled as an interstage gain error. One way to compensate for interstage gain errors is to adjust the reference voltage from each stage to the next so that the ratio of the reference in one stage to the corresponding value in the previous stage is equal to 1+/spl epsi/, where /spl epsi/ is the gain error between the stages. This pipelined ADC uses monolithic calibration to adjust the reference voltages of the first two stages in the background during normal ADC operation to compensate for gain errors in the first two interstage amplifiers. Calibration is potentially useful even at an 8b level because it allows the use of small capacitors and low op-amp gain, reducing power dissipation and the minimum required supply voltage and increasing the maximum speed in a given technology. The key contributions here are the use of background calibration to improve the linearity of a pipelined ADC and the implementation of these techniques with the ADC on one CMOS IC.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839683","","CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Calibration;Capacitors;Linearity;Operational amplifiers;Power dissipation;Redundancy;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;calibration;low-power electronics;pipeline processing","8 bit;CMOS;background calibration;gain errors;linearity;monolithic calibration;pipelined ADC;power dissipation;reference voltage","","11","6","3","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With parallel terminated systems such as GTL with 2 nodes, a bus turnaround low-to-low switch with no dead-cycle needs a round-trip propagation delay to settle and be sampled reliably.

Prior to 1984, attempts failed because of the poor quality of thin films of complex materials. Currently, two materials compete for the large-scale integration development of FeRAMs. The first is a perovskite ceramic known as PZT (PbZr/sub 1-x/Ti/sub x/O/sub 3/). The second material is known as a layered perovskite such as SBT (SrBi/sub 2/Ta/sub 2/O/sub 9/). For low-density devices which employ thin films of either material with a thickness <300 nm operated at 3-5 V, both materials yield approximately the same results. As FeRAMs enter the deep submicron realm, the ferroelectric thin-film technology is ready to support high-density integration. SBT-based devices can be integrated as capacitors in DRAM-like 1T/1C stacked cells and flash-like FeFET cells. Experience with embedded FeRAMs is positive, so that the system-on-chip as well as stand-alone high-density devices are foreseen. The possibility of 1 V operation at a few to several tens of nanoseconds write with nonvolatility brings FeRAMs to the forefront of non-volatile memories. Scaling of capacitor areas as small as 0.04 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ is possible. With capacitor and FET technologies, FeRAMs blur the line between non-volatile memories as DRAM-like destructive read-out (DRO) devices and flash-like non-destructive read-out (NDRO) devices, which compete for the highly mobile generation of Internet devices and G-3 phones.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839779","","Capacitors;Ceramics;Ferroelectric films;Ferroelectric materials;Large scale integration;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Smart cards;Thin film devices;Transistors","ferroelectric storage;ferroelectric thin films;integrated memory circuits;random-access storage","0.35 micron;1 to 5 V;300 nm;DRAM-like 1T/1C stacked cells;PZT;PbZr/sub 1-x/Ti/sub x/O/sub 3/;PbZrO3TiO3;SBT based devices;SrBi/sub 2/Ta/sub 2/O/sub 9/;deep submicron devices;embedded FeRAMs;ferroelectric RAMs;ferroelectric memories;ferroelectric thin-film technology;flash-like FeFET cells;high-density integration;layered perovskite;nonvolatile memories;perovskite ceramic","","3","","6","","","9-9 Feb. 2000","07 Feb 2000-09 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the USB supply voltage can range from 4.0 V to 5.5 V, the required DC/DC converter is of the up/down type. Known solutions are, e.g., the SEPIC converter, which requires a transformer, and the combination of an upconverter and a linear regulator, which results in a low efficiency. The presented on-chip DC/DC converter needs only an external coil and output capacitor. A digitally-controlled three-phase switching scheme is employed for easy implementation with high efficiency.

Downscaling trends have forced the analog semiconductor industry to move to the digital domain to maintain functionality in light of increasing short-channel effects and device mismatch. Furthermore, the main goal of the new technology is to achieve faster speed and lower cost. In leading-edge processes and design environments, conventional analog PLLs in systems-on-chip (SoCs) are being replaced by digitally operated PLLs to meet clock requirements for optimal overall system performance. While a widely used time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based digital PLL (TDC-DPLL) has a linear loop characteristic, which is simple and analogous to well-known analog PLLs, it has to overcome noise issues from TDC quantization error and phase noise from the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The in-band noise floor of a TDC-DPLL is determined by the TDC resolution. Thanks to noise shaping techniques with oversampling and a pipelined architecture, noise performance can be improved. However, significant area and power must be spent to meet noise requirements. A bang-bang-based digital PLL (BB-DPLL), as the alternative type of DPLL has advantages in terms of area and power over a TDC-DPLL. However, its non-linear operation implies a longer lock time, limit-cycle noise, and high sensitivity to DCO noise. In addition, the in-band noise floor of a BB-DPLL is dominated by the input-tracking jitter, which mainly arises from the DCO noise. This paper presents a BB-DPLL in 14nm FinFET technology, combining a feed-forward delay-locked part (FFDLP) and phase-locked part (PLP) to mitigate aforementioned weaknesses.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063028","","Clocks;Feeds;FinFETs;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","MOSFET;delta-sigma modulation;digital phase locked loops;oscillators;phase noise;power supply circuits;quantisation (signal);semiconductor industry;system-on-chip;time-digital conversion","2nd-order ΔΣ analogous bang-bang digital PLL;CMOS technology;DCO;FFDLP;FinFET technology;PLP;SoC;TDC quantization error;analog semiconductor industry;digitally-controlled oscillator;feed-forward delay-locked operations;feedforward delay locked part;frequency 32 MHz to 2000 MHz;input-tracking jitter;noise shaping;phase locked part;phase noise;phase-locked operations;power 2.06 mW;power supply;size 14 nm;sub-threshold slope;systems-on-chip;time-to-digital converter","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All-digital or fully synthesizable approaches, which exploit the merits of advanced processes, suffer from poor noise performance and high power consumption [2]. On the other hand, hybrid approaches, which employ analog components such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs), digital-to-time converters, phase interpolators (PIs) and regulators, have the typical difficulties associated with analog circuits, such as low output resistance, small voltage headroom and large variation. In this paper, we propose a highly digital architecture for a DPLL - one which minimizes the design effort typically required for analog circuits. The power and area-consuming circuits in prior works are replaced by power and area-efficient circuits with competitive performance. For example, a conventional time-to-digital converter (TDC) usually occupies considerable chip area in order to maximize input dynamic range with precise resolution [1]. Instead, in this work, a time-windowed phase-to-digital converter using interpolated DCO phases as a phase reference is adopted. In addition, conventional synchronous counters in the feedback path drastically increase the power consumption. Furthermore, retiming of data from the TDC is unavoidable due to the meta-stability of the sampling flip-flops [1]. The proposed divider scheme, which is composed of a multi-modulus frequency divider and a dead-zone-free phase and frequency detector (PFD), eliminates the need for a synchronous counter and retiming circuits. A calibration-free ΔΣ modulator (DSM) noise canceller is also included.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-4515-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487723","","Analog circuits;Feeds;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Solid state circuits","delta-sigma modulation;digital phase locked loops;flip-flops;frequency dividers;interference suppression;phase detectors","DAC;DPLL;PFD;TDC;all-digital approach;analog circuits;analog components;calibration-free ΔΣ modulator noise canceller;calibration-free DSM noise canceller;dead-zone-free phase-frequency detector;digital PLL;digital fractional-N phase locked-loop;digital-to-analog converters;digital-to-time converters;frequency 32 MHz to 2000 MHz;interpolated DCO phases;multimodulus frequency divider;phase interpolators;phase-interpolating phase-to-digital converter;power 5.3 mW;power-area-consuming circuits;power-area-efficient circuits;regulators;sampling flip-flop meta-stability;semiconductor processes;synchronous counters;time-to-digital converter;time-windowed phase-to-digital converter","","2","","6","","","17-21 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of further system function onto a single-chip provides lower cost and higher performance and is an obvious direction. Another suggestion is that the leading-edge microprocessor in 2000 will be an 8-way superscaler RISC (reduced instruction set computer) chip, with a clock rate of 750 MHz, implemented in 0.25 mu m (feature size), 2.5 V, 4-layer-metal CMOS technology.

The chip uses a BiCMOS process that features a set of devices for high-frequency mixed-signal designs; including 24 GHz NPNs, 0.7 /spl mu/m L/sub eff/ CMOS, 250 and 2000 /spl Omega//sq. polyresistors, 2 fF//spl mu/m/sup 2/ capacitors, Schottky diodes, and lateral PNPs. Early process samples with 16 GHz f/sub T/ are used in the evaluation. Improved performance is expected with the final process. The gates are designed for sufficient speed and nominal VEE of -3.3 V. Even though differential current mode logic (CML) with a differential voltage swing of less than 360 mV/sub pp/ is employed, a wiring capacitance of several 10 fF increases the power-delay product significantly. Wiring length is minimized by local biasing and omission of routing channels. The size of gates with two-level series gating (latch, and, xor) including emitter follower outputs is 67/spl times/58 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. The result of this local biasing scheme is a favourable positive temperature coefficient (TC) for the logic swing, partly compensating for the negative TC of the current switch gain at the cost of high sensitivity to supply variations. All transistors have 0.7 /spl mu/m minimum emitter length, the width avoids the high current region. The other logic gates are downscaled in case of 2.5 GHz operation, input emitter followers omitted in those latches driven from the external clocks.","0193-6530","0-7803-3136-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.1996.488571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488571","","BiCMOS integrated circuits;CMOS process;Capacitors;Clocks;Demultiplexing;Performance evaluation;Prototypes;Switches;Testing;Wiring","BiCMOS integrated circuits;clocks;current-mode logic;demultiplexing equipment;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","10 Gbit/s;BiCMOS;clock;data recovering 1:4-demultiplexer;differential current mode logic;emitter follower outputs;external VCO;mixed-signal designs;positive temperature coefficient;power-delay product;two-level series gating;wiring capacitance","","3","6","9","","","10-10 Feb. 1996","08 Feb 1996-10 Feb 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
