In this paper we outline fundamental problems in incremental logic synthesis and physical design.

Given a corner block list, it takes only linear time to construct the floorplan. Unlike the O-tree structure, which determines the exact floorplan based on given block sizes, corner block list defines the floorplan independent of the block sizes. Thus, the structure is better suited for floorplan optimization with various size configurations of each block. Based on this new structure and the simulated annealing technique, an efficient floorplan algorithm is given. Soft blocks and the aspect ratio of the chip are taken into account in the simulated annealing process. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm is quite promising.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896442","","Application software;Binary trees;Circuit simulation;Computer science;Simulated annealing;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;computational complexity;simulated annealing","O-tree structure;VLSI floorplan;aspect ratio;corner block list;non-slicing floorplan;simulated annealing;size configurations;topological representation","","92","","7","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","13","16","Several novel topological representations of non-slicing floorplans have been more recently proposed, providing new ideas and techniques for solving block placement problems and other related layout applications. Among these topological representations, ordered trees exhibit a lower redundancy and, therefore, a provable smaller search space, which makes them the best topological candidate for solving general block placement problems. Starting from the early eighties, binary trees have been widely used to represent slicing floorplans. This paper shows that binary trees can efficiently model non-slicing floorplans as well, as there is a one-to-one mapping between the sets of binary and ordered trees representing the floorplan. Moreover, this paper shows that binary trees exhibiting a certain property can be used to represent block placement configurations with symmetry constraints, which is very useful when dealing with device-level placement problems for analog layout. As the number of these trees is proven to be smaller than the number of symmetric-feasible sequence-pairs, using binary trees is better than using either sequence-pairs or O-trees when solving analog placement problems. A comparative evaluation, substantiating these theoretical results, has been carried out by providing alternative optimization engines to a placement tool operating in an industrial environment.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896443","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896443","","Binary trees;Constraint optimization;Constraint theory;Cost function;Engines;Genetic algorithms;Integrated circuit layout;Simulated annealing;Space exploration;Vegetation mapping","circuit layout CAD;simulated annealing","binary trees;block placement;block placement configurations;device-level placement problems;non-slicing floorplans modelling;one-to-one mapping;ordered trees;symmetry constraints","","10","5","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The manual process of creating a behavioral description is error prone, so significant effort must be made to verify the correctness of behavioral descriptions. Simulation-based validation and formal verification are both techniques used to verify correctness. We investigate validation because formal verification techniques are frequently intractable for large designs. The first step toward a behavioral validation technique is the development of a validation fault coverage metric which can be used to evaluate the likelihood of design defect detection with a given test sequence. We propose a validation fault coverage metric which is based on an analysis of the control data flow description associated with the behavior. The proposed metric identifies a subset of paths through the data flow which must be traversed during testing to detect faults. The proposed metric is a tractable compromise between the statement coverage metric which requires only that each statement be executed, and the path coverage metric which requires that all data flow paths be executed. Data flow paths are identified based on the relative code locations of definitions and uses of variables which may be assigned incorrectly due to a design error. We propose an efficient method to compute all data flow paths which must be traversed, and we generate coverage results for several benchmark VHDL circuits for comparison to other approaches.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896500","","Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Data flow computing;Error correction;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Formal verification;Hardware design languages;Testing","data flow analysis;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic CAD","behavioral HDL descriptions;benchmark VHDL circuits;control data flow description;data flow fault coverage metric;design defect detection;formal verification;hardware circuit;high-level functionality;simulation;validation fault coverage metric","","11","","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply the new symmetry definition to analyze a large set of benchmark circuits and provide extensive data showing the existence of substantial symmetries in those circuits.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","511","518","Most hardware description frameworks, whether schematic or textual, use cooperating finite state machines (CFSM) as the underlying abstraction. In the CFSM framework, a designer explicitly manages the concurrency by scheduling the exact cycle-by-cycle interactions between multiple concurrent state machines. Design mistakes are common in coordinating interactions between two state machines because transitions in different state machines are not semantically coupled. It is also difficult to modify one state machine without considering its interaction with the rest of the system. This paper presents a method for hardware synthesis from an ""operation centric"" description, where the behavior of a system is described as a collection of ""atomic"" operations in the form of rules. Typically, a rule is defined by a predicate condition and an effect on the state of the system. The atomicity requirement simplifies the task of hardware description by permitting the designer to formulate each rule as if the rest of the system is static. An implementation can execute several rules concurrently in a clock cycle, provided some sequential execution of those rules can reproduce the behavior of the concurrent execution. In fact, detecting and scheduling valid concurrent execution of rules is the central issue in hardware synthesis from operation-centric descriptions. The result of this paper shows that an operation-centric framework offers significant reduction in design time, without loss in implementation quality.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896524","","Automata;Clocks;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Laboratories;Law;Microprocessors;Out of order;Processor scheduling","finite state machines;logic design","concurrency;cooperating finite state machines;cycle-by-cycle interactions;hardware synthesis;multiple concurrent state machines;operation-centric descriptions;operation-centric hardware descriptions;scheduling","","21","","19","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the interconnect distributions of 3-D circuits. We divide the 3-D interconnects into horizontal wires and vertical wires and derive their wire-length distributions, respectively. Based on the stochastic wire-length distributions, we calculate 3-D circuit interconnect delay distribution. We show that 3-D structures effectively reduce the number of long delay nets, significantly reduce the number of repeaters needed, and dramatically improve the performance. With 3-D structures, a circuit can work at a much higher clock rate (double, even triple) than with 2-D.

In this paper we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global nets given an existing buffer block plan. Assuming that global nets have been already decomposed into two-pin connections, we give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and Konemann (1998) and Fleischer (1999). Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals-as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection-are satisfied. Our model allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection. In addition, our algorithm observes buffer parity constraints, i.e., it will choose to use an inverter or a buffer (=co-located pair of inverters) according to source and destination signal parity. The algorithm outperforms previous approaches and has been validated on top-level layouts extracted from a recent high-end microprocessor design.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896458","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer graphics;Computer science;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;High performance computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Inverters;Repeaters;Silicon","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit interconnections","available buffer block plan;buffer parity constraints;global buffering;global interconnect;microprocessor design;top-level layouts","","12","1","25","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a hierarchical approach to define a set of FPGA configurations in which each fault is detectable, and each fault pair is differentiable. The cornerstone of this work is the concise expression of the distinguishing conditions of each fault pair. Experimental results demonstrate that nearly 100% fault coverage and diagnostic resolution are achieved with a low number of test configurations.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896517","","Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Computer architecture;Costs;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic devices;Reconfigurable logic","fault diagnosis;field programmable gate arrays;logic testing","cluster-based FPGA architectures;diagnostic resolution;fault diagnosis;field programmable gate arrays;hierarchical approach;interconnect faults diagnosis;logic blocks;test configurations","","13","","13","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the periodic task graphs have hard deadlines, the aperiodic tasks can have either hard or soft deadlines. Periodic task graphs are first scheduled statically. Slots are created in this static schedule to accommodate hard aperiodic tasks. Soft aperiodic tasks are scheduled dynamically with an on-line scheduler. Flexibility is introduced into the static schedule and optimized to allow the on-line scheduler to make dynamic modifications to the static schedule. This helps minimize the response times of soft aperiodic tasks through both resource reclaiming and slack stealing. Of course, the validity of the static schedule is maintained. The on-line scheduler also employs dynamic voltage scaling and power management to obtain a power-efficient schedule. Experimental results show that the flexibility introduced into the static schedule helps improve the response times of soft aperiodic tasks by up to 43%. Dynamic voltage scaling and power management reduce power by up to 68%. The scheme in which the static schedule is allowed to be flexible achieves up to 3.2% more power saving compared to the scheme in which no flexibility is allowed, when both schemes are power-conscious.

Various logic and delay models have been explored. Most simulation research has focused on improving simulation performance. New approaches to both compiled and event driven simulation have been explored. The internal operations of event-driven simulators can be divided into two categories, scheduling, and gate simulation. Much effort has been focused on reducing the cost of scheduling. There has also been effort to reduce the cost of gate simulation. It has also been shown that explicit computation of gate outputs is unnecessary, as long as event propagation is computed correctly. Even though research has reduced the complexity of both scheduling and gate simulation, it is still necessary to test for event propagation and cancellation, and it is necessary to perform some computations during gate simulation. This paper shows that none of these computations are necessary. Most computations are devoted to testing internal states and computing new internal states. In our technique, subroutine addresses are used to maintain states. This permits the elimination of all state-testing and state-computation code. Our technique is significantly faster than conventional event-driven simulation.

Since traditional logic synthesis applies transformations without consideration of global design characteristics such as regularity and dataflow, it destroys a substantial amount of regular structures. In addition, due to the non-incremental nature of most logic transformations, synthesis relies vastly on the computationally expensive concept of trial and error application of transformations, a time-consuming process in the synthesis of large designs. The proposed approach addresses both shortcomings of traditional logic synthesis and describes a mechanism to speed up logic synthesis and preserve regularity. It selectively applies transformations to places with similar characteristics and to the same stage of a regular structure, introducing a notion of dataflow-aware synthesis. Preservation of regular structures has tremendous advantages to the following physical design stages. It yields high-density layouts, shorter wiring length and improved delay. In addition, the layout becomes more predictable at an earlier design stage.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896511","","Delay;Design automation;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Fabrication;Logic design;Microelectronics;Minimization;Wire;Wiring","data flow computing;logic CAD","dataflow;dataflow-aware synthesis;delay;high-density layouts;logic synthesis;regularity;regularity information;shorter wiring;transformations","","9","","12","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The critical path value of a combinational logic block varies by as much as 17%, and the global skew is increased by 8%. Thus, a significant timing error (/spl sim/25%) and performance loss takes place if variability is not properly addressed. We derive a model, which allows estimating performance degradation for the given circuit and process parameters. Analysis shows that the spatial, rather than proximity-dependent, systematic Lgate variability is the main cause of large circuit speed degradation. The degradation is worse for the circuits with a larger number of critical paths and shorter average logic depth. We propose a location-dependent timing analysis methodology that allows to mitigate the detrimental effects of Lgate variability, and developed a tool linking the layout-dependent spatial information to circuit analysis.

The performance optimization algorithms, however, assume a single value for each parameter. It is known that under the load-independent delay model, the gate assignment (or resizing) problem is solvable in time polynomial in the circuit size when a single value is assumed for each parameter. In the presence of different rise and fall parameter values, this problem was recently shown to be NP-complete even for chain and tree topology circuits under the simple load-independent delay model. In this paper, we propose it dynamic programming algorithm for solving this problem exactly in pseudo-polynomial time for tree circuits. More specifically, we show that the problem can be solved in time proportional to the size of the tree circuit, the number of choices available in the library for each gate, and the delay of the circuit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pseudo-polynomial exact algorithm for the gate assignment problem for trees in the presence of different rise and fall delays. We present a straightforward way of extending this algorithm to general directed acyclic graphs. We present experimental results on a set of benchmark problems using a standard commercial library and show that our algorithm generates provably optimum delays for 72 out of 76 circuits. We also compare our technique with two approaches traditionally used to solve this problem in the industry and academia and show that it is slightly better than these two. Interestingly, both traditional approaches also yield delays not far from the optimum.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896513","","Capacitance;Circuit topology;Delay effects;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Libraries;Load modeling;Optimization;Polynomials;Tree graphs","circuit complexity;delays;logic CAD","NP-complete;delay model;delays;gate assignment;pseudo-polynomial time;rise and fall parameter values;tree circuits","","2","1","14","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At such error rates, it is not feasible to evaluate the performance of a design using straightforward, simulation based, approaches. Nevertheless performance prediction before actual hardware is built is essential for the design process. This work introduces a stochastic model and an analysis-based, nonMonte-Carlo method for performance evaluation of digital data communication circuits. The analyzed circuit is modeled by a number of interacting finite state machines with inputs described as functions on a Markov chain state-space. The composition of these elements results in a typically very large Markov chain. System performance measures, such as probability of bit errors and rate of synchronization loss, can be evaluated by solving linear problems involving the large Markov chain's transition probability matrix. This paper first describes a dedicated multi-grid method used to solve these very large linear problems. The principal bottleneck in such an approach is the size of the Markov chain state-space, which grows exponentially with system complexity. The second part of this paper introduces a novel, graph based, data structure capable of efficiently storing and manipulating transition probability matrices for several million state Markov chains. The methods are illustrated on a real industrial clock-recovery circuit design.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896488","","Automata;Circuit analysis;Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Data communication;Error analysis;Hardware;Performance analysis;Process design;Stochastic processes","Markov processes;data communication equipment;finite state machines;performance evaluation","Markov chain;Markov chains;bit-error-rate specification;communication circuit performance;finite state machines;graph representations;high-speed data networks;performance prediction;stochastic model","","1","","9","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an example, we consider a P/G network structure modeled as an overlying mesh with underlying trees originating from the mesh, which eases the task of analysis with acceptable performance sacrifices. A fast and efficient event-driven P/G network simulator is proposed, which hierarchically simulates the P/G network with an adaptation of PRIMA to handle non-zero initial conditions. An adjoint network that incorporates the variable topology of the original P/G network, as elements switch in and out of the network, is constructed to calculate the transient adjoint sensitivity over multiple intervals. The gradients of the most critical node with respect to each wire width and decap are used by a sensitivity-based heuristic optimizer that minimizes a weighted sum of the wire and the decap area. Experimental results show that this procedure can be used to efficiently optimize large networks.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896518","","Capacitors;Circuit topology;Discrete event simulation;Network topology;Optimization methods;Performance analysis;Skeleton;Switches;Voltage;Wire","circuit layout CAD;circuit simulation","P/G network structure;PRIMA;decoupling capacitors;event-driven P/G network simulator;fast analysis;optimization;power/ground networks;sensitivity-based heuristic optimizer;structured skeleton;tree-structured networks","","31","1","9","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is desirable to design hyper-universal switch boxes with the minimum number of switches. A previous work, Universal Switch Module, considered such a design problem concerning 2-pin net routings around a single FPGA switch box. However, as most nets are multi-pin nets in practice, it is imperative to study the problem that involves multi-pin nets. In this paper, we provide a new view of global routings and formulate the most general k-sided switch box design problem into an optimum k-partite graph design problem. Applying a powerful decomposition theorem of global routings, we prove that, for a fixed k, the number of switches in an optimum k-sided switch box with W terminals on each side is O (W), by constructing some hyper-universal switch boxes with O(W) switches. Furthermore, we obtain optimum, hyper-universal 2-sided and 3-sided switch boxes, and propose hyper-universal 4-sided switch boxes with less than 6.7 W switches, which is very close to the lower bound 6 W obtained for pure 2-pin net models.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896456","","Boolean functions;Computer science;Councils;Field programmable gate arrays;Logic arrays;Pins;Routing;Switches;Topology;Wire","field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;minimisation of switching nets","FPGA switch box;FPGA switch box design;decomposition theorem;global routings;multi-pin net topologies;optimum k-partite graph design;routing resource constraints","","3","","14","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to develop several new algorithms for incorporation into a PDP framework that can rectify the well-known drawbacks of traditional PDP (increasingly localized view of nets with increasing levels of the partitioning tree, min cut objective, inaccuracy and cost of terminal propagation (TP), irreversibility of move decisions), while preserving its considerable advantages (time efficiency, flexibility in accurately incorporating many optimization metrics, and flexibility in satisfying most constraints). We have developed several novel techniques within a PDP-based framework that yield the best wire-length results so far on all but two of the MONO benchmark suite. Our major innovations are: (1) simultaneous level partitioning (SLP) in which we partition the entire circuit globally in every level of the partitioning tree, across the current cutline(s); (2) cell gain computation based on a global or distributed view of entire nets (thus obviating TP) and on the bounding-box (BB) minimization of nets (as opposed to mincut in prior PDP); (3) move irreversibility tackled in a pest-processing phase via vertical and horizontal swaps. Empirical results indicate that our PDP algorithm SPADE (for Simultaneous level Partitioning with Distributed lie., global] nEt views) provides almost 202 better wirelength results than an internal version of ""regular"" PDP with min-cut based gains, 10.8% better than the previous best PDP method QUAD, 10.6% better than TimberWolf (TW) 7.0, 15.846 better than the state-of-the-art force-directed technique from U.

In coverage-directed validation, coverage metrics are defined that quantitatively measure the degree of verification coverage of the design. Motivated by recent work on observability-based coverage metrics for models described in a hardware description language, we develop a method that computes an observability-based code coverage metric for embedded software written in a high-level programming language. Given a set of input vectors, our metric indicates the instructions that had no effect on the output. An assignment that was not relevant to generate the output value cannot be considered as being covered.

This paper presents gate duplication as a strategy for performance optimization. Many timing optimization strategies have been proposed over the past few years. In the past few years, the research community has looked at gate duplication extensively as a method of reducing the cut-set of partitions. Strategies of logic duplication for cut-set minimization have been suggested. The strength of gate duplication as a cut-set minimizing strategy has been demonstrated. However applicability of this strategy in reducing the circuit delay has not been studied in detail. In this paper we prove the problem of partitioning a set of fanouts between a gate and it's replica (both gates have the same fanins) such that the required time constraint at the input pin is met, to be NP-Complete. Hence even the local optimization by gate duplication problem (formally defined later) is also NP-Complete. We then present an algorithm for gate duplication which is based on the dynamic programming approach. Since the problem of partitioning a set of fanouts between a node and it's replica is NP-Complete, we use a heuristic for making this decision which is optimal under specific conditions. We report delay improvements as high as 8% over highly optimized results generated by SIS. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with the delay model and provides basic definitions. Section 3 reviews the complexity of the global gate duplication problem. Section 4 presents the proof of NP-Completeness for the local gate duplication problem. Section 5 describes a heuristic for gate duplication in detail, followed by results in Section 6. This is followed by some observations and conclusion in Section 7.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896512","","Capacitance;Circuits;Delay;Dynamic programming;Logic;Minimization;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Tail;Timing","computational complexity;dynamic programming;logic CAD;logic partitioning;minimisation of switching nets","NP-Complete;complexity;cut-set minimization;delay optimization;dynamic programming;fanouts;gate duplication;logic synthesis;partitioning","","8","1","9","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an efficient method to estimate this factor such that the delay response of a decoupling circuit model can emulate the original coupling circuit. Under the assumptions of zero initial voltage, equal charge transfer, and 0.5V/sub DD/ as the switching threshold voltage, an upper bound of 3/spl times/ for maximum delay and a lower bound of -1/spl times/ for minimum delay can be proven. Efficient Newton-Raphson iteration is also proposed as a technique for computing the Miller factor or effective capacitance. This result is highly applicable to crosstalk coupling delay calculation in deep submicron gate-level static timing analysis. Detailed analysis and approximation are presented. SPICE simulations are demonstrated to show high correlation with these approximations.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896453","","Capacitance;Charge transfer;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Delay estimation;SPICE;Threshold voltage;Timing;Upper bound;Zero voltage switching","SPICE;crosstalk;delays;logic CAD;timing","Miller factor;Newton-Raphson iteration;SPICE simulations;active coupling capacitance;coupling delay computation;crosstalk coupling delay calculation;deep submicron circuitry;deep submicron gate-level static timing analysis;gate-level coupling delay calculation;upper bound;zero initial voltage","","31","4","13","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Cross-talk immune VLSI design using a network of PLAs embedded in a regular layout fabric","Khatri, S.P.; Brayton, R.K.; Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.","","Computer Aided Design, 2000. ICCAD-2000. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","412","418","We present a VLSI design methodology to address the cross-talk problem, which is becoming increasingly important in Deep Sub-Micron (DSM) IC design. In our approach, we implement the logic netlist in the form of a network of medium sized PLAs. We utilize two regular layout ""fabrics"" in our methodology, one for areas where PLA logic is implemented, and another for routing regions between such logic blocks. We show that a single PLA implemented in the first fabric style is not only cross-talk immune, but also about 2/spl times/ smaller and faster than a traditional standard cell based implementation of the same logic. The second fabric, utilized in the routing region between individual PLAs, is also highly cross-talk immune. Additionally, in this fabric, power and ground signals are essentially ""pre-routed"" all over the die. Our synthesis flow involves decomposing the design into a network of PLAs, each of which has a bounded width and height. The number of inputs and outputs of each PLA are flexible as long as the resulting PLA width is bounded. We perform folding of PLAs to achieve better logic density. Routing is performed using 2,3,4,5 and 6 routing layers. State-of-the-art commercial routing tools are utilized for the experiments involving the use of 3,4,5 and 6 routing layers. We have implemented the entire design flow using these ideas. Our scheme results in a reduction in the cross-talk between signal wires of between one and two orders of magnitude. As a result, for a 0.1 /spl mu/m process, the delay variation due to cross-talk dramatically drops from 2.47:1 to 1.02:1. Additionally, our methodology results in circuits that are extremely fast and dense, with a timing improvement of about 15% and an overall area penalty of about 3% compared to standard cells. The regular arrangement of metal conductors in our scheme results in low and highly predictable inductive and capacitive parasitics, resulting in highly predictable designs. The crosstalk immunity, high s- eed, low area overhead and high predictability of our methodology indicate that it is a strong candidate as the preferred design methodology in the DSM era.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896507","","Circuits;Delay;Design methodology;Fabrics;Network synthesis;Programmable logic arrays;Routing;Signal synthesis;Very large scale integration;Wires","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;crosstalk;integrated circuit design;logic CAD;programmable logic arrays","IC design;PLA logic;VLSI design;cross-talk;crosstalk immunity;design methodology;logic netlist;synthesis flow","","21","17","24","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","464","467","Built-in self-test (BIST) schemes need to set the state of the circuit under test (CUT) for each test vector applied. The two primary techniques by which the state is set are test-per-scan and test-per-clock. In a test-per-scan scheme, circuit states are set using one or more scan chains. Several scan cycles are required to apply a single test vector. In very large circuits, the time to apply each test vector may be quite high. The direct option of reducing test time with a fast scan clock is difficult to realize in practice. In a test-per-clock scheme, all circuit flip-flops are loaded in parallel. A new test vector can be applied in each cycle. The area overhead incurred in accessing each storage element directly is quite significant. We propose a new Broadcast BIST (B/sup 2/IST) scheme as a compromise between the two approaches. B/sup 2/IST uses time-division multiplexing (TDM) to load multiple storage elements in a broadcast group in a single clock cycle, but through only a single scan data input. Based on our B/sup 2/IST simulation, we compare the layout overhead and performance of B/sup 2/IST with that of traditional BIST schemes on ISCAS benchmark circuits. Thus, B/sup 2/IST can achieve the performance of a test-per-clock scheme, but only incur the overhead of a test-per-scan scheme.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896515","","Automatic testing;Broadcasting;Built-in self-test;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Clocks;Flip-flops;System testing;Test pattern generators;Time division multiplexing","built-in self test;logic testing","BIST;Broadcast BIST;circuit under test;performance;scan chains;test vector;test-per-clock;test-per-scan;time-division multiplexing;very large circuits","","1","","11","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even existing heuristic approaches take too much time when iterative exploration over a large design space is required and do not yield minimum results. The logic minimization approach presented in this paper is based on state graph exploration in conjunction with single-cube cover algorithms, an approach that has not been considered for minimization of extended burst-mode finite state machines previously. Our algorithm achieves very fast logic minimization by introducing compacted state graphs and cover tables and an efficient single-cube cover algorithm for single-output minimization. Our exact logic minimizer finds minimal number of literal solutions to all currently available benchmarks, in less than one second on a 333 MHz microprocessor-more than three orders of magnitude faster than existing literal exact methods, and over an order of magnitude faster than existing heuristic methods for the largest benchmarks.

This paper addresses the problem of minimizing power dissipated in switching of the buses in data path synthesis. Unlike the previous approaches in which minimization of the power consumed in buses has not been considered until operation scheduling is completed, our approach integrates the bus binding problem into scheduling to exploit the impact of scheduling on reduction of power dissipated on the buses more fully and effectively. We accomplish this by formulating the problem into a flow problem in a network, and devising an efficient algorithm which iteratively finds maximum flow of minimum cost solutions in the network. Experimental results on a number of benchmark problems show that given resource and global timing constraints our designs are 22% power-efficient over the designs produced by a random-move based solution, and 18% power-efficient over the designs by a clock-step based optimal solution.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896491","","CMOS digital integrated circuits;Capacitance;Computer science;Energy consumption;Network synthesis;Optimization methods;Portable computers;Power dissipation;Scheduling;Timing","CMOS logic circuits;high level synthesis","benchmark problems;bus binding;data path synthesis;minimizing power dissipated;network flow method;scheduling","","5","","13","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This includes the distributed RLC effects of wires as well as the coupling between wires. We also propose a general class of coding techniques to reduce energy dissipation for data transmission by trading-off between computation and communication costs. An algorithm is presented to design efficient coding strategies to minimize energy. When the effects of interwire capacitance are taken into account, the best coding strategy is not to simply minimize transitions - an approach followed by previous research. Instead, Transition Pattern Coding (TPC) modifies the transition profile to minimize energy, and in many cases higher transition activity can result in lower energy.

In this paper, we present new algorithms to minimize the complexity of multiplier blocks under the given delay constraints. By analyzing multiplier blocks in view of delay, three delay reduction methods are proposed and combined into previous algorithms. Since the proposed algorithms can generate multiplier blocks that meet the specified delay, a trade-off between delay and hardware complexity is enabled by changing the delay constraints.

We observe that an incremental design methodology is typically built from a full optimizer that generates a solution for an initial instance, and an incremental optimizer that generates a sequence of solutions corresponding to a sequence of perturbed instances. Our hypothesis is that in practice, there can be a mismatch between the strength of the incremental optimizer and the magnitude of the perturbation between successive instances. When such a mismatch occurs, the solution quality will degrade-perhaps to the point where the incremental optimizer should be replaced by the full optimizer. We document this phenomenon for three distinct domains-partitioning, placement and routing-using leading industry and academic tools. Our experiments show that current CAD tools may not be correctly designed for ECO-dominated design processes.

This greatly increases the computational efficiency of the FDTD method for classes of problems where the cell size of the three-dimensional space lattice is constrained to be much smaller than the shortest wavelength in the source spectrum. One such class of problems is the analysis of highspeed VLSI interconnects where full-wave methods are often needed for the accurate analysis of parasitic electromagnetic wave phenomena. In this paper, we present an enhanced FDTD-ADI formulation which permits the modeling of realistic lossy materials such as semiconductor substrates and metal conductors as well as artificial lossy materials needed for perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions.

Specifically, the effect of loop filter characteristics, phase-frequency detector and phase noise of the open loop voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) on the PLL output spectrum is quantified. These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results, specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors. The PLL output spectrum computation only requires the phase noise of the VCO, loop filter and phase detector noise, phase detector gain and loop filter transfer function and does not require the transient simulation of the entire PLL which can be very expensive.

Given a kernel, the proposed algorithm explores the space of feasible clustered datapaths and returns: a datapath configuration; a binding and scheduling for the operations; and a corresponding estimate for the best achievable latency over the specified family. Moreover, we show how the parameters m and n, as well as a target latency optionally specified by the designer, can be used to effectively explore trade-offs among delay, power/energy, and latency.

In this paper, we propose a path selection technique that can consider power supply noise effects on the propagation delays. Next, for the selected critical paths, we propose a pattern generation technique for dynamic timing analysis such that the patterns produce the worst-case power supply noise effects on the delays of these paths. Our experimental results demonstrate the difference in estimated circuit performance for the case when power supply noise effects are considered vs. when these effects are ignored.

We present a new interconnect metric called ECM that accounts for this resistive shielding by computing an effective capacitance to model the downstream capacitance.

Algorithms for this problem are online in nature since they must operate without knowledge of the arrival time or service requirements of future requests. In this paper, we present online algorithms to manage power for embedded systems. We perform an empirical analysis of these algorithms and give theoretical justification for the empirical results. Effective power management strategies have an adverse impact on the latency of the system for which the strategy is designed. Typically, the more aggressive the power management scheme, the greater the increase in the latency of the system. In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the additional latency of the system introduced by power management strategies. Moreover, we show that this upper bound occurs each time the system is shutdown and hence is an important system design parameter. In addition, service time and latencies have an effect on power management strategies since they alter the length and occurrences of idle periods which. We study this phenomenon experimentally, by modeling the disk drive of a laptop computer as an embedded system. The results show that if service times of arriving requests are modeled, the relative performance of algorithms can change leading to non-adaptive algorithms performing better than adaptive ones. We compare the performance of adaptive and non-adaptive power management algorithms. In particular, our experimental results show that an ""immediate"" shutdown strategy that shuts down the system whenever it encounters an idle period performs surprising better than sophisticated adaptive algorithms suggested in the literature. We provide an analytical explanation for the effectiveness of power management strategies.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896497","","Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Embedded system;Energy management;Performance analysis;Power dissipation;Power system management;Power system modeling;Turning;Upper bound","embedded systems;power consumption","embedded system;power management;system level power management;upper bound","","5","1","16","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interconnect extraction tools employ hierarchy to manage complexity, but this hierarchy is discarded via eliminating far away coupling terms when the equivalent ARC circuits are Formed. The increasing dominance of capacitance coupling along with the emergence of on chip inductance, however, makes the composite effect of far-away couplings increasingly evident. Even if newly enforced design rules and practices will ultimately obviate the need for modeling these couplings for design verification, some approximation of the ""exact"" solution is required to validate these rules. This paper proposes an efficient hierarchical equivalent circuit representation of interconnect parasitics that utilizes the efficient hierarchical long-distance modeling already existing within extractors. Results from a prototype simulator based on these hierarchical models demonstrate the simulation inaccuracy incurred when the faraway coupling terms are ignored. Such a form of interconnect modeling may provide the key to hierarchical modeling of electro-magnetic interactions between large components on future gigascale systems.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896477","","Capacitance;Circuit simulation;Coupling circuits;Disaster management;Equivalent circuits;Explosions;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;RLC circuits;Virtual prototyping","circuit complexity;circuit layout CAD","RLC interconnect modeling;capacitance coupling;deep submicron physical modeling;design verification;hierarchical equivalent circuit representation;hierarchical interconnect circuit models;hierarchical modeling;interconnect parasitics","","4","13","7","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, given the tight constraints imposed by the layout (e.g., area availability, congestion), only those synthesis transforms can be made layout-driven that are local and layout-friendly. Examples of such transforms are net buffering, gate resizing, and gate replication. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the delay of a mapped, roughly placed, and globally-routed design by buffer insertion and/or deletion without violating the local area constraints imposed by the layout and without overloading any buffer/cell pins. We believe that this is one of the most fundamental problems in layout-driven buffer optimization. To the best of our knowledge, no technique has been established to date that solves this problem. The concept of local (or block) area constraints we use in this paper is more powerful than that of the total design area traditionally used in logic synthesis.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896502","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit synthesis;Delay effects;Design optimization;Laboratories;Logic design;Routing;Signal design;Timing;Wire","circuit layout CAD;data flow analysis;logic CAD;minimisation;optimisation;timing","area availability;congestion;deep sub-micron technologies;delays;gate replication;gate resizing;interconnect loads;layout-driven area-constrained timing optimization;logic synthesis;net buffering","","4","1","10","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these issues we have developed an on-chip bus network design methodology and corresponding set of tools which, for the first, time, close the synthesis loop between system and physical design. The approach has three components: a communication profiler, a bus network designer, and a fast approximate floorplanner. The communication profiler collects run-time information about the traffic between system cores. The bus network design component optimizes the bus network structure by coordinating information from the other two components.

In behavioral synthesis, a memory is viewed as an abstract construct which hides the detail implementations of the memory. Consequently, for a vendor's memory, behavioral synthesis should create a clean model of the memory wrapper which abstracts the properties of the memory that are required to interface to the rest of the circuit. However, this wrapping process invariably demands the verification problem of the memory access protocols in order to be safely used in behavioral synthesis environment. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology of verifying the correctness of the memory wrapper. Specifically, we analyze the complexity of the problem, and derive an effective solution which is not only practically efficient but also highly reliable. For designers who use memories as design components in behavioral synthesis, automating our solution shortens the verification time significantly in contrast of simulating memory accesses in the context of full design, which is a quite complex and time-consuming process, especially for designs with many memory access operations.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896447","","Abstracts;Access protocols;Circuit synthesis;Computer science;Context modeling;Hardware design languages;Information technology;Process design;Testing;Wrapping","access protocols;computational complexity;formal verification","abstract construct;behavioral synthesis;memory access operations;memory access protocols verification","","0","","5","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for designs with very large state spaces, prior to the application of an algorithm, the refinement-checking task needs to be decomposed into subtasks of manageable complexity. It is natural to decompose the task following the component structure of the design. However, an individual component often does not satisfy its requirements unless the component is put into the right context, which constrains the inputs to the component. Thus, in order to verify each component individually, we need to make assumptions about its inputs, which are provided by the other components of the design. This reasoning is circular: component A is verified under the assumption that context B behaves correctly, and symmetrically, B is verified assuming the correctness of A. The assume-guarantee paradigm provides a systematic theory and methodology for ensuring the soundness of the circular style of postulating and discharging assumptions in component-based reasoning. We give a tutorial introduction to the assume-guarantee paradigm for decomposing refinement-checking tasks. To illustrate the method, we step in detail through the formal verification of a processor pipeline against an instruction set architecture. In this example, the verification of a three-stage pipeline is broken up into three subtasks, one for each stage of the pipeline.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896481","","Algorithm design and analysis;Formal verification;Graphics;Hardware;Information technology;Pipelines;Protocols;Signal processing;Silicon;State-space methods","computational complexity;formal verification;high level synthesis;inference mechanisms","assume-guarantee paradigm;assume-guarantee reasoning;formal verification;instruction set architecture;model-checking algorithms;refinement proofs;three-stage pipeline","","9","5","14","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the influence of the slope of a signal at a particular node on the subsequent path delay, an earlier signal with a signal slope greater than the slope of the later signal may result in a greater delay. Therefore, the traditional method for timing analysis may identify the incorrect critical path and report an optimistic delay for the circuit. We show that the circuit delay calculated using the traditional method is a discontinuous function with respect to transistor and gate sizes, posing a severe problem for circuit optimization methods. We propose a new timing analysis algorithm which resolves both these issues. The proposed algorithm selectively propagates multiple signals through each timing edge in cases where there exists ambiguity regarding which arriving signal represents the critical path. The algorithm for propagating the corresponding required times is also presented. We prove that the proposed algorithm identifies a circuit's true critical path, where the traditional timing analysis method may not. We also show that under this method circuit delay and node slack are continuous functions with respect to a circuit's transistor and gate sizes. In addition, we present a heuristic method which reduces the number of signals to be propagated at the expense of a slight loss in accuracy. Finally, we show how the proposed algorithm was efficiently implemented in an industrial static timing analysis and optimization tool, and present results for a number of industrial circuits. Our results show that the traditional timing analysis method underestimates the circuit delay by as much as 38%, while that the proposed method efficiently finds the correct circuit delay with only a slight increase in run time.","1092-3152","0-7803-6445-7","","10.1109/ICCAD.2000.896495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896495","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit simulation;Delay effects;Digital circuits;Logic circuits;Optimization methods;Propagation losses;Signal resolution;Switches;Timing","circuit analysis computing;logic circuits;timing","circuit delay;critical path;digital circuit;static timing analysis","","4","","9","","","5-9 Nov. 2000","05 Nov 2000-09 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of minimizing the maximum path delay, our approach minimizes the maximum mean delay on any circuit loop, thus enabling the full optimization potential of clock skew scheduling and in-place retiming. We present two versions of the new algorithm: one approximates sequential criticality and weights wires accordingly (Cong and Lim, 2000), the other extends this with the inclusion of explicit wire-length constraints for loops that limit the final clock period.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20070226","2006","","","464","471","Because of the increasing dominance of interconnect issues in advanced IC technology, placement has become a critical step in the IC design flow. To get accurate interconnect information during the placement process, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into it. However, previous global routers are computationally expensive. It is impractical to perform global routing repeatedly during placement. In this paper, we present an extremely fast and high-quality global router called FastRoute. In traditional global routing approaches, congestion is not considered during Steiner tree construction. So they have to rely on the time-consuming maze routing technique to eliminate routing congestion. Different from traditional approaches, we proposed a congestion-driven Steiner tree topology generation technique and an edge shifting technique to determine the good Steiner tree topologies and Steiner node positions. Based on the congestion-driven Steiner trees, we only need to apply maze routing to a small percentage of the two-pin nets once to obtain high quality global routing solutions. We also proposed a new cost function based on logistic function to direct the maze routing. Experimental results show that FastRoute generates less congested solutions in 132times and 64times faster runtimes than the state-of-the-art academic global routers Labyrinth (R. Kastner et al, 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (R. T. Hadsell and P. H. Madden, 2003), respectively. It is even faster than the highly-efficient congestion estimator FaDGloR (J. Westra and P. Groeneveld, 2005). The promising results make it possible to incorporate global routing directly into placement process without much runtime penalty. This could dramatically improve the placement solution quality. We believe this work will fundamentally change the way the EDA community look at and make use of global routing in the whole design flow","1092-3152","1-59593-389-1","1-59593-389-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2006.320159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110216","","Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Permission;Routing;Runtime;Steiner trees;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces","integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;trees (mathematics)","Chi Dispersion router;FaDGloR;FastRoute;IC design flow;Labyrinth router;Steiner tree topology generation;advanced IC technology;congestion estimation;edge shifting;electronic design automation;global routing;logistic function;maze routing;placement process","","36","2","21","","","5-9 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We start from exact solutions to the transmission line equations proposed by Davis and Meindl (IEEE Trans. Electron. Dev., vol. 47, no. 11, pp. 2068-2087, 2000.). We make appropriate modifications due to finite rise time. They affect the delay calculation and hypothesis pertaining to the constancy of the electromagnetic parameters. We study these effects in detail. To find the domain of physical variables where transmission line behavior is feasible, we pose the problem as a nonlinear minimization problem in a space spanned by two continuous variables, with four parameters. From the resulting solutions and employing monotonicity properties of the functional we extract regimes of validity. These regimes of validity happen to be commensurate with what is reachable and doable with current leading technologies. We complete this study with a qualitative analysis of driver insertion in the presence of transmission lines. The resulting configurations are suitable for the development of an improved clock design discipline.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167555","","Clocks;Delay;Digital integrated circuits;Distributed parameter circuits;Electrons;Equations;Minimization;Space technology;Transmission line theory;Transmission lines","circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;clocks;delays;digital integrated circuits;inductance;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;minimisation;network routing;transmission line theory","clock design configurations;clock trees;continuous variable space;delay calculation;digital integrated circuits;driver insertion;electromagnetic parameters constancy;finite rise time;functional monotonicity properties;inductance coupling effects;interconnects;nonlinear minimization problem;physical variables domain;transmission line behavior;transmission line design;transmission line equations;transmission line propagation;validity regimes","","9","12","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On interactions between routing and detailed placement","Jariwala, D.; Lillis, J.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Illinois Univ., Chicago, IL, USA","Computer Aided Design, 2004. ICCAD-2004. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20050131","2004","","","387","393","The main goal of This work is to develop deeper insights into viable placement-level optimization of routing. Two primary contributions are made. First, an experimental framework in which the viability of predictive models of routing congestion for optimization during detailed placement can be evaluated, is developed. The main criteria of consideration in these experiments is how (un)reliably various models from the literature detect routing hot-spots. We conclude that such models appear to be too unreliable for detailed placement optimization. Second, motivated by the first result, we present a unified combinatorial framework in which cell placement and exact routing structures are captured and optimized; the framework relies on the trunk-decomposition of global routing structures and optimization is performed by a generalized optimal interleaving algorithm (Hur and Lillis, 2000). A proof of concept implementation of this framework is studied in the FPGA domain. The technique can reduce the number of channels at maximum density by almost 45% on average with maximum reduction of 68% for optimized global routing.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382606","","Computer science;Design optimization;Digital systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Interleaved codes;Logic design;Predictive models;Routing;Simulated annealing;White spaces","circuit optimisation;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;network routing","FPGA;cell placement;detailed placement optimization;generalized optimal interleaving algorithm;global routing structures;optimized global routing;routing congestion models;routing hot-spot detection;trunk-decomposition;viable placement-level optimization","","4","","14","","","7-11 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Chang et al., Proc. 87th ACM/IEEE Des. Aut. Conf., pp. 458-463, 2000), where the typical presence of an arbitrary number of symmetry groups of devices is directly taken into account during the exploration of the solution space. The efficiency of the novel approach is due to a data structure called segment tree, mainly used in computational geometry.","1092-3152","0-7803-7607-2","","10.1109/ICCAD.2002.1167578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167578","","Analog circuits;Computational geometry;Computer science;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Coupling circuits;Encoding;Routing;Space exploration;Tree data structures","analogue integrated circuits;circuit complexity;circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;network topology;search problems;trees (mathematics)","absolute placement representations;analog layout;analog placement;binary tree layout representations;computational geometry;data structure;device-level placement;illegal cell overlap;search space;segment trees;solution space exploration;symmetry constraints;symmetry groups","","10","17","","","","10-14 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
