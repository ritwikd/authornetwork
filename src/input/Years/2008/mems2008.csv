The test chip consists of 5 silicon nanowires and a reference resistor, each with integrated contacts for electrical 4-point measurements. We show an increase in the piezoresistive effect of 633% compared to bulk silicon. Preliminary temperature measurements indicate a larger temperature dependence of silicon nanowires, compared to bulk silicon. An increase of up to 34% compared to bulk polysilicon is observed in polysilicon nanowires with decreasing dimensions.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443757","","Contacts;Crystallization;Electric variables measurement;Fabrication;Nanowires;Piezoresistance;Resistors;Semiconductor device measurement;Silicon;Testing","electron beam lithography;nanolithography;nanowires;piezoresistance;silicon","EBL;bulk polysilicon;e-beam lithography;electrical four-point measurements;piezoresistive effect;silicon test chips;top-down fabricated silicon nanowires","","13","2","9","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The operation principle of the tuning mechanism is based on the application of an axial force to a cantilever-like suspension flexure, built in such a way that the real pivot is replaced by a virtual one, which provides a center of rotation. The axial force is provided by an electrostatic transducer realized in the framework of the single layer multiple close-gap electrodes actuation concept. Devices with three different types of suspensions were fabricated and characterized. Experimental and theoretical results collectively show that the suggested approach can be efficiently implemented for resonant frequency tuning in tilting devices.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443742","","Electrodes;Electrostatic actuators;Fabrication;Laboratories;Oscillators;Resonance;Resonant frequency;Torque;Transducers;Tuning","bending;circuit tuning;electrostatic devices;micromechanical devices;oscillators;transducers","axial force;axially loaded suspension flexure;cantilever-like suspension flexure;electrostatic transducer;linear tuning;micro oscillators;resonant frequency tuning;single layer multiple close-gap electrodes actuation concept;tilting oscillators;tuning mechanism","","0","","5","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents integration of magnetic induction to MCA in addition to pneumatic induction. Magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs) are used to magnetically label the target cells. Electroplated structures into micro channels as magnetic paths can induce magnetic flux generated behind MCA substrate.

Unlike traditional methods of monitoring progress in machining, which rely on electrical characteristics at the discharge supply terminals, this method is less affected by parasitics. The depth location of a metal-metal interface can be distinguished in the wireless signal. This is useful for determining the stop depth in certain processes. For example, in machining through samples of stainless steel into an electroplated Cu backing layer, a 10 dBm change in wireless signal strength for the 300-350 MHz band and a 5 dBm average change across the full 1 GHz bandwidth defined the transition. As debris accumulate in the discharge gaps, shifts in the wireless spectra can also indicate spurious discharges that could damage workpiece and tool. For example, when copper micromachining became debris dominated, the 800-850 MHz band dropped 4 dBm in signal strength with a 2.2 dBm average drop across the full 1 GHz bandwidth.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443672","","Bandwidth;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Conducting materials;Copper;Fault location;Machining;Micromachining;Signal generators;Steel","copper;electrical discharge machining;electroplating;micromachining;process monitoring;stainless steel;wireless sensor networks","Cu;FeCCrJk;bandwidth 1 GHz;debris characteristics;discharge quality;discharge supply terminals;electrical characteristics;electroplated copper backing layer;frequency 300 MHz to 350 MHz;frequency 800 MHz to 850 MHz;metal-metal interface;microelectro-discharge machining;micromachining;real-time wireless monitoring;spurious discharges;stainless steel;wireless spectra;workpiece material","","1","","11","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parylene (poly-para-xylylene) CVD can caulk porous PDMS structure and provide low permeable characteristics. The longstanding drawback is that parylene deposition on PDMS spoils elastic features of PDMS. MEMS devices using deformation of PDMS such as micro pump and micro balloon actuator requires not only high sealing but also high elasticity of PDMS. Deposited parylene permeates PDMS and then forms a film on PDMS. Our key idea is to remove a surface parylene layer on PDMS with the aim of keeping elastic features of PDMS. O<sub>2</sub> plasma etching is applied to remove unnecessary surface parylene. This paper evaluates sealing and elastic features of parylene-caulked PDMS.

The initial damage was characterized as an equivalent crack distribution from the results of quasi-static tensile tests, i.e., from the distribution of static strength. The fatigue crack extension process determining fatigue lifetime was then estimated by the well-known Paris law with two unknown parameters. These were fit to the results of fatigue tests performed on specimens with two different situations of etching damage. In spite of the difference in static strength, the parameters are consistent among the two cases. This implies that fatigue crack extension law is inherent to the material and that lifetime can be estimated on the basis of static strength.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443685","","Etching;Fatigue;Life estimation;Life testing;Lifetime estimation;Materials testing;Micromechanical devices;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Transistors","elemental semiconductors;etching;fatigue cracks;fatigue testing;life testing;micromechanical devices;semiconductor thin films;silicon;stress analysis;tensile strength;tensile testing","MEMS materials;Paris law;Si;cyclic loading condition;equivalent crack distribution;etching damage;fatigue crack extension process;fatigue lifetime prediction;fatigue tests;polycrystalline silicon thin films;quasistatic tensile tests;static strength distribution","","5","","9","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By combining the experimental data obtained on the mechanical properties of the elastic membrane and volume of gas generated per unit of mass of the propellant, design rules were defined for the realization of balloon actuators based on pyrotechnics. The dimensions of the system linked to the volume of propellant allow tuning the amplitude of the deformation of the membrane obtained during its combustion. The pyrotechnic balloon actuator fabricated is capable of large out of plane deflection (up to 6 mm) in few milliseconds.

The air-liquid interface is fixated at the microscale pores of a perforated silicon diaphragm, each pore functioning as a static Laplace valve. Our system was experimentally tested using airborne smoke particles of ammonium chloride and aqueous salt solution as the liquid.

The full-wafer sputtered metallization layer must be locally removed to guarantee a well defined, low-reflections and low-loss signal propagation in the transmission line. Gold areas to be etch are exposed to a 1.2 V potential difference to a saturated calomel reference electrode in a NaCl(aq) solution. Further, the selective removal of the metallization on the stoppers of laterally moving electrostatic actuators has been shown to drastically reduce the mechanical wear on the stopper tip.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443673","","Fabrication;Gold;Metallization;Microswitches;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Silicon;Sputter etching;Transmission lines;Wet etching","electrochemical electrodes;electrostatic actuators;etching;gold;micromachining;microswitches;silicon-on-insulator;sputtered coatings;wear","3D micromachined SOI RF MEMS devices;Si-SiO<sub>2</sub>;electrochemically assisted wet etching;electrostatic actuators;full-wafer sputtered metallization layer;gold metallization layer;laterally actuated microswitches;low-loss signal propagation;maskless etching;mechanical wear;metallic layers removal;micromachined SOI-based radio-frequency transmission lines;saturated calomel reference electrode;silicon core;voltage 1.2 V","","3","","9","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two types of packaging have been developed for different applications; one is for low pressure, high accuracy application, the other is for high pressure, high temperature application. The former is fully characterized across the range of 0.5 psi to 25 psi and -55degC to 300degC and the latter is calibrated across the range of 16 to 600 psi and -55degC to 500degC. A digitized curve fitting technique is used to calibrate the sensors by use of on-chip temperature signals. After curve fitting, the accuracy is < 0.05% F.S. for the first type of the pressure sensor and < 0.25% F.S. for the second type of the pressure sensor.

The resonator is a square-extensional bulk-acoustic-resonator with two fundamental modes of vibration. The modes feature different temperature coefficients of the frequency and therefore by measuring the frequency change of both modes of vibration the temperature information can be deduced. The measured temperature is used to mathematically compensate for the temperature induced drift of the second eigenmode. The advantage of the demonstrated in-situ temperature measurement is that as no external temperature sensor is needed, the resonator temperature is accurately measured and hysteresis arising from different temperature time constants for heating and cooling of the sensor and resonator is eliminated.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443597","","Acoustic measurements;Acoustic signal detection;Frequency measurement;Hysteresis;Microcavities;Micromechanical devices;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Time measurement;Vibration measurement","acoustic resonators;bulk acoustic wave devices;compensation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;frequency measurement;micromechanical resonators;temperature measurement","eigenmodes;frequency-shift measurement;micromechanical resonator;square-extensional bulk-acoustic-resonator;temperature compensation;temperature measurement;vibrating modes","","8","4","10","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed process, characteristics of DNA, such as hybridization specificity of complementary pairs of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and the dependence of hybridization on ambient temperature (melting temperature T<sub>m</sub>) plays a key role. These characteristics of DNA can be designed and synthesized by base-pair sequence of DNA. Three types of self-assembly experiments using two types of ssDNA with different T<sub>m</sub> (65degC and 50degC) were carried out; 1.) between Au nanoparticles, 2.) between Au nanoparticle and Au coated substrate, and 3.) between silicon micro components (5times5times3 mum<sup>3</sup>) and Au coated substrate. Through these experiments, it was successfully verified that the sequence of the self-assembly can be controlled by controlling the ambient temperature. The reversibility of this process was also confirmed.

With the requirements of further miniaturization of the sensor in the fields of the portable fuel cells and chemical analyzers, we newly developed the fabrication process to miniaturize it less than 2.0 mm in external diameter by using a heat shrinkable tube. The film sensor fabricated by photolithography was inserted inside tube manually. By applying heat shrinking process, the film was automatically mounted on the inner wall surface, and the outer size of the tube was miniaturized to almost of the half size from its original. The final inner and outer diameters of the tube were 1.2 mm and 1.7 mm, respectively. We evaluated the fundamental performance of this flow sensor. The electrical resistance at the sensor linearly increased with temperature. The obtained temperature coefficient of resistance of the sensing element was 0.0023 K<sup>-1</sup>. We measured the relationship between the input power consumption and the gas flow rate, and finally evaluated the response time.

A DC voltage of 80-140 V is applied between the electrode and the workpiece through a resistance-capacitance circuit that controls the pulse energy and timing of spark discharges. The suspended electrode is electrostatically actuated towards the wafer, resulting in a breakdown, or spark discharge. This instantly lowers the gap voltage, releasing the electrode, and the capacitor is charged up through the resistor. Sequential pulses are produced through the self-regulated discharging-charging cycle. Micromachining of the stainless-steel wafer is demonstrated using an electrode with the area of 1.6times1.03 mm<sup>2</sup>, achieving removal depth of 20 mum with 100 V that provides the electrode's displacement of ~30 mum.

The air pockets trapped at a superhydrophobic micrograting during liquid priming are coupled to an actively controlled pressure source, allowing the pressure difference over the air/liquid interface to be dynamically adjusted. This allows for manipulating the friction reduction properties of the surface, enabling active control of liquid mass flow through the channel. It also permits for sustainable air lubrication at theoretically unlimited liquid pressures, without loss of superhydrophobic properties. With the non-optimized grating used in the experiment, a difference in liquid mass flow of 4.8% is obtained by alternatively collapsing and recreating the air pockets using the coupled pressure source, which is in line with a FE analysis of the same geometry. A FE analysis of a more optimized geometry predicts a mass flow change of over 30%, which would make possible new microfluidic devices based on local friction control.

By using antibodies-coated magnetic beads, WBC can be purified and enriched, followed by extracting the genomic DNA utilizing the charge switchable DNA-specific magnetic beads in the lysis solution. Then, the specific genes associated with genetic diseases can be amplified and analyzed during the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process. A new membrane-type micro-mixer was proposed for mixing the WBC with CD15/CD45-coated magnetic beads during incubation process. A circular microcoils array was developed for purification and enrichment of WBC. A new two-way circular pneumatic micro-pump and a bio-separator/micro-reactor were also integrated for genomic DNA extraction and bio-reaction. The extracted DNA can be transported automatically to a micro PCR chamber for fast nucleic acid amplification. The developed system may provide a powerful platform for WBC sample pre-treatment and fast diagnosis of genetic diseases.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443594","","Bioinformatics;DNA;Diseases;Genetics;Genomics;Humans;Magnetic switching;Microfluidics;Micromechanical devices;White blood cells","DNA;arrays;bioMEMS;biochemistry;biomedical equipment;blood;cellular biophysics;coils;diseases;genetics;magnetic particles;microfluidics;micropumps;microreactors;patient diagnosis;pneumatic systems;proteins","DNA extraction module;MEMS technologies;PCR process;WBC enrichment;WBC purification;antibodies-coated magnetic beads;bio-separator;circular microcoils array;genetic diseases detection;human white blood cells pretreatment module;incubation process;lysis solution;magnetic-bead-based microfluidic systems;membrane-type micromixer;micro-electro-mechanical-systems;microreactor;nucleic acid amplification module;polymerase chain reaction;two-way circular pneumatic micropump","","0","","14","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For mobile information displays such as electronic papers, the mechanical stability to expansion and the function to mechanically magnify the display area are very attractive. For this purpose, we utilized helical-coiled structure of nylon fabric as a substrate and selectively coated an organic conductive polymer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):polystyrenesulfornate(PSS) on the fabric for constructing the pixels and electrodes of displays. Since the PEDOT:PSS-coated nylon is capable of mechanically expanding its electric wiring not by stretching the conductive film itself, but by changing pitch between coils, the fracture of the electronic materials is prevented under large deformation. The deformation of our structure reached the strain of 1.25 without large increase of the electric resistance. In our developed process of PEDOT:PSS patterning, KMPR photoresist was spontaneously penetrated into the defined area of nylon. The photoresist was lifted off after PEDOT:PSS was coated.

A reduced order (RO) model built using the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure as well as a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis were used in order to predict the actuator behavior and evaluate design parameters. Devices of four different configurations were fabricated by a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) based process using silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers.

Three pneumatic side-chambers were placed at T-junction and flow-focusing channels to construct the controllable moving-wall structure. Compressed air was used to activate the moving-all structure. The deformation of the controllable moving-wall structure can physically change width of the microchannel. Therefore the flow velocity can be locally changed by applying compressed air pressure. Size of the internal droplets at the intersection of the T-junction channel was then fine-tuned. Then the internal droplets were focused into a narrow stream hydrodynamically and finally chopped into double emulsion droplets using a pair of pneumatic moving-wall structures downstream. For single emulsion, the average droplets size of the oil-in-water emulsion could be actively fine-tuned from 50.07 to 21.80 mum under applied air pressures ranging from 10 to 25 psi with a variation less than 3.53%.

The valve is controlled by the spinning frequency and can be switched to be open when the centrifugal pressure overcomes the pneumatic pressure inside an unvented reaction cavity. We designed and characterized valves ranging in centrifugal burst pressure from 6700 Pa to 2100 Pa. Based on this valving principle we present a new structure for aliquoting of liquids.

Single molecule fluorescence detection within this chamber is enhanced through microfluidic recirculation, enabling single molecule analysis comparable to traditional capillary-based platforms. Proof of concept is demonstrated using a 10X sample concentrator upstream to a 5 nanoliter CFS detection chamber and recording the subsequent increase in single molecule fluorescent bursts.

It has been demonstrated that jetting drops between 10 pl - 200 pi can produce PZT films with acceptable uniformity for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in thicknesses between 100 nm and 400 nm. With a 10pl droplet, the spot size of the deposited solution on top of a platinum surface is approximately 43 mum and the edge variation is +/- 10mum. It has also been shown that edge variation can be improved to less than +/- 1mum by constraining fluid flow with a patterned barrier.

These results demonstrated that the proposed cascade configurations have the capability to improve the actuation stroke of electrostatic actuators.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","978-1-4244-1793-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443695","","CMOS process;Dielectrics;Electrostatic actuators;Etching;Fingers;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromachining;Micromechanical devices;Silicon compounds;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;electrostatic actuators;micromachining","CMOS processes;electrostatic comb-drive actuator;micromachining","","1","","9","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Air-coupled ultrasound is an attractive inspection technique for materials or structures that are not suitable for contact or immersion ultrasound inspections. However, due to large acoustic impedance mismatch between air and materials in the system, tremendous acoustic power losses exist. To overcome this problem, the efficiency of the ultrasound transducers needs to be improved. We have developed large-gap capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) that have high transduction efficiency in air. The CMUT has a patterned dielectric insulation layer that supports large acoustic output but eliminates dielectric breakdown or charging failures. Acoustic tests showed that the CMUTs had significantly higher transduction efficiency than the state-of-the-art commercial transducers. This indicates improvement of air-coupled CMUTs is achievable and may lead to wide use of CMUTs for air inspections.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-1792-6","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443810","","Acoustic materials;Acoustic testing;Acoustic transducers;Dielectric breakdown;Dielectric materials;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Impedance;Inspection;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic transducers","ultrasonic materials testing;ultrasonic transducers","acoustic impedance mismatch;air-coupled ultrasound transducers;capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers;dielectric breakdown;inspection technique;nondestructive evaluation;patterned dielectric insulation layer","","3","1","10","","","13-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
