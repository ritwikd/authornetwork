The always-on nature of the WuRx sets a power dissipation floor for the entire system. In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the data rate reaches 40Gb/s, skin-effect and dielectric loss in the transmission medium cause significant loss at high frequencies, leading to considerable ISI even if the data is transmitted over a short copper cable. To reduce the ISI and improve the BER, extensive equalization is required in the receiver side. It is also highly desirable to integrate the equalizer with the CDR circuit on the same chip. This paper describes a 40Gb/s CMOS serial-link receiver that performs both adaptive equalization and CDR.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523076","","Adaptive equalizers;Bit error rate;Broadband communication;Circuits;Communication cables;Copper;Dielectric losses;Frequency;Intersymbol interference;Propagation losses","CMOS integrated circuits;adaptive equalisers;radio receivers","BER;CDR circuit;CMOS serial-link receiver;adaptive equalization;bit error rate;bit rate 40 Gbit/s;broadband communication systems;data rate;dielectric loss;skin-effect;transmission medium","","7","1","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It includes a high-band PA and its switched-mode supply modulator on the same silicon die, which avoids the need for an external GaAs chip. The differential PA reaches 60% PAE at 31dBm with a 1.95GHz carrier. The supply modulator is a single- coil SMPS with no additional linear amplifier. It features a 15MHz AC bandwidth without pre-distortion thanks to its 130MHz PWM and achieves 83% peak efficiency at 2W output power. The overall transmitter peak PAE with a WCDMA signal is 49% at 27dBm and at 3.6V supply voltage. Careful PCB implementation keeps switching harmonics below -60dBc. The ER system achieves -39/-47dBc 1st/2nd ACLR and rms EVM below 4% at 27dBm without pre-distortion, in compliance with WCDMA requirements.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523308","","Bandwidth;Circuits;Coils;Erbium;Gallium arsenide;Multiaccess communication;Power generation;Pulse width modulation;Silicon;Switched-mode power supply","code division multiple access;power amplifiers;switched mode power supplies","single-chip WCDMA envelope reconstruction LDMOS PA;switched-mode power supply","","42","1","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software-defined radios (SDR) are being considered as a likely platform to build tomorrow's handsets. The receiver in such radios can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies and can support multiple modulation schemes. Consequently, broadband receivers with good linearity and noise performance over a wide band are needed. The digital part of an SDR will dominate the silicon area, mandating the use of advanced CMOS technologies. The analog/RF circuitry is preferably integrated on the same die as the digital part. This paper describes a fully integrated broadband receiver front-end in 45nm baseline CMOS.

Proper transistor layout, complete and accurate modeling and optimized parasitic extraction method enabled the robust design of the wideband super-heterodyne architecture to support the entire 57- to-66GHz band. The analog radio front-end is controlled by a serial digital interface and has been co-designed and integrated together with a high-speed digital signal processor including analog-to-digital conversion, high speed PHY signal processing such as frequency-offset compensation, phase tracking, FIR and DFE, to support both advanced OFDM and SCBT modulation scheme. The resulting single-chip solution enables data throughputs exceeding 7Gb/s (QPSK) and 15Gb/s (16QAM) for a total DC power budget of below 200mW in TDD operation.

With proper frequency planning, only divide-by-2 dividers are needed in the feedback path of the PLL. Thus, more precise in- phase and quadrature phase sub-harmonics can be derived from the divider chain for SSB frequency mixing. On the other hand, the number of mixer stages in cascade is reduced to 2 for full- band carrier generation. Using a sub-harmonic I/Q calibration, the image spurs are suppressed below -45dBc and more than 33dB SFDR is achieved for the full band generation.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523089","","Amplitude modulation;Calibration;Clocks;Feedback;Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;Mixers;Multiplexing;Phase locked loops;Tuning","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency division multiplexing;frequency synthesizers;phase locked loops;ultra wideband communication","14-Band CMOS frequency synthesizer;14-band CMOS I/Q frequency synthesizer;MB-OFDM UWB system;SSB frequency mixing;divide-by-2 dividers;frequency 3 GHz to 10 GHz;frequency planning;in-phase subharmonics;quadrature phase subharmonics;single-PLL architecture;spurs reduction","","8","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a highly digital ADC architecture compatible with advanced CMOS processes, capable of operating down to a supply voltage of 200mV (i.e., subthreshold regime) and up to 900mV.

Many standards however, call for larger vertical eye openings that require raising the dc supply voltage from the 1.0 V limit for thin-oxide devices(FETs) in 65 nm technology to 1.2 or 1.5 V. These requirements are addressed in the proposed SST transmitter design by combining a thin-oxide pre-driver stage running at 1.0 V followed by thick-oxide output stages operated at 1.5 V. Key features of this design include the implementation of tri-statable output slices consisting of programmable binary-weighted pre-distortion slices to achieve a mutually independent adjustment of the impedance tuning and FIR-based transmitter equalization, the level shifter design and the application of T-coils that enable a broad-band impedance matching with a return loss of -16 dB over 10 GHz bandwidth. Moreover, the transmitter is capable to suppress the clock duty-cycle distortion by a factor of 5x.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523081","","Circuits;Clocks;Electrostatic discharge;FETs;Impedance;Loss measurement;MOSFETs;Multiplexing;Optical transmitters;Resistors","CMOS integrated circuits;FIR filters;clocks;coils;driver circuits;equalisers;field effect transistors;impedance matching;transmitters","CMOS;FET;FIR-based transmitter equalization;SST transmitter design;bit rate 8.5 Gbit/s;clock duty-cycle distortion suppression;high-swing source-series-termination;impedance tuning;programmable binary-weighted predistortion;return loss;size 65 nm;source-series-terminated driver;thin-oxide device","","4","3","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of resonant techniques have been reported to overcome clock distribution problems. It has a convenient standing-wave mode that separates the low-amplitude segment from the conventional standing wave. The space-filling-curve flexibly distributes the fine clock even to an irregular area. The short latency without hierarchy results in low jitter and low skew. The curve is finally connected to the starting point to obtain a large loop. It reduces the load inductor by half and the reduction reduces the area penalty. The clock distribution network is implemented by employing an interposer.

The MP BB filter is an active-RC 3 rd-order Chebyshev architecture that drives an 8b pipelined ADC with fs=50 MHz. The AP is a scaled-down version of the MP, with the primary difference being the inclusion of an IM3 generator.

To achieve high memory bandwidth, various techniques such as widening input/output pins shrinking the unit array size, and performing a read operation and a write operation concurrently have been reported. However, these embedded DRAM macros incur considerable area penalty to obtain high memory bandwidth. Among the techniques for achieving high bandwidth, the concurrent read/write operation is a very effective method in performing a read-modify-write function and a double-buffer function for the graphics applications. A pseudo-two-port embedded DRAM macro that performs concurrent read/write operations at high frequency without sacrificing cell efficiency is reported in this paper. To accomplish this, a read/write cross-point switch circuit (RWCC) and distributed steering redundancy switches (DSRS) are introduced. A 32 Mb macro is characterized via a test-chip fabricated in a 65 nm embedded DRAM process.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523164","","","DRAM chips;computer graphics;telecommunication switching","DSRS;RWCC;concurrent read-write operation;cross-point switch circuit;distributed steering redundancy switch;frequency 833 MHz;graphics applications;pseudo-two-port embedded DRAM","","2","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","212","608","In a WCDMA FDD system, since the transmitter and receiver operate concurrently, the receiver is plagued by the transmitter leakage due to finite isolation of antenna duplexer. As a consequence, the transmitter noise at the receive band degrades the sensitivity, unless the noise is further attenuated before reaching the receiver. Due to the modest Q of on-chip inductors, typically the use of a costly SAW filter placed before the PA is inevitable. On the other hand, the external filter may be eliminated through sufficiently lowering the transmitter noise for any given duplexer. However, given the power-noise trade off, in all previous designs due to the lack of an on-chip filtering mechanism, meeting the stringent noise requirement has resulted in an excessive transmitter power dissipation. To address these issues, a feedback-based filtering technique to suppress the receive-band noise with negligible area or power penalty is presented. Stability analysis reveals that with practical transmitter gain distribution, optimum component sizes, and for a typical required noise suppression, using a simple first- or second-order RC LPF, the feedback remains stable and no additional compensation is required.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523132","","Degradation;Filtering;Inductors;Multiaccess communication;Power dissipation;Receiving antennas;SAW filters;Stability analysis;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas","code division multiple access;notch filters;radio transmitters","SAW filter;antenna duplexer;code division multiple access;filtering technique;integrated notch filter;low-power WCDMA transmitter;on-chip inductors;power-noise trade off;stability analysis;transmitter leakage","","8","4","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Expensive scaled CMOS processes are readily used as a technology enabler to provide adequate performance. The high implementation cost of circuits in such processes is justified by the added functionality of the circuits, however it also drives the desire for low-area solutions in standard digital CMOS. For example, low-area inductor-less LNAs take advantage of the high ft of scaled CMOS. Unfortunately, stringent phase noise requirements make inductors unavoidable in VCOs. This leads to solutions with area-demanding multiple- inductor synthesizers or spur-hazardous multiply-and-divide sections to cover the wide frequency range required for multi- standard receivers.

The paper shows the P/E cycle dependence of the threshold-voltage distribution and program/erase time. The threshold-voltage distribution does not degrade, and maintains enough margin to the wordline level (4.5 V) even after 1M P/E cycles. Erase time is 10 ms/block (average) for the first P/E cycle and 20 ms/block (average) after 1M P/E cycles. This is almost the same erase performance as on-board EEPROM, due to the DCNOR structure that does not use the read channel during program operation. On the other hand, program time increase is caused by charge trapping at tunnel oxide, but program time is 500 mus/word (average) even after 1M P/E cycles. The threshold-voltage shift value is only -1V after 1000 hr bake at Ta = 250 degC. These results indicate that the 8 kB E2FLASH is able to replace on-board EEPROM.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523280","","Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Channel hot electron injection;Clocks;Control systems;Degradation;EPROM;Nonvolatile memory;Registers;Sensor systems","automotive electronics;flash memories;microcontrollers","DataFLASH module;EEPROM;automotive MCU;charge trapping;program-erase time;storage capacity 8 Kbit;temperature 250 C;threshold-voltage distribution;tunnel oxide","","4","","2","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The generator is built from cascaded quad corrector stages, each of which in turn, can be understood as a modification of a common interpolating 4-stage ring oscillator. In the circuit, the delay of each stage is a linear superposition of the delays Phi of the associated inner and outer loop elements. If the outer loop element inputs are made independent, the driven oscillator is resulted. Provided the input drive is sufficient, the frequency of the driven oscillator is that of the driving input, and the phase of each internal node is an interpolation of the phase of its input drive and the phase of the preceding stage. This interpolation acts to average offsets from quadrature in the incoming phases. If the input drive is insufficient, the oscillator will run near its natural or unloaded frequency, omega<sub>0</sub>=2pif<sub>o</sub>.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523255","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Cutoff frequency;Delay;Design optimization;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Predictive models;Ring oscillators;Transceivers","clocks;interpolation;oscillators","4-stage ring oscillator;cascaded quad corrector stages;linear superposition;open-loop quadrature clock generator;outer loop element inputs","","4","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In PONs, the fast-locked CDR circuit must lock within tens of bit times once the data packets arrive. The so-called burst-mode CDR (BMCDR) circuits with gated VCOs (GVCOs) have been presented. To meet the requirements of different PON standards, a multi-band BMCDR circuit is very desirable. The conventional multi-band technique is realized by a GVCO with dividers. Since the GVCO has to operate at the highest speed, it dissipates a fixed power, even though only a low data rate is required. Furthermore, the dividers introduce extra time delays to reduce the sampling margin that may become an issue for high data rates. In this work, a 20/10/5/2.5Gb/s power-scaling BMCDR circuit is implemented in 90nm CMOS technology. It is aimed to scale the power of a BMCDR circuit for different data rates. To realize a power-scaling multi-band BMCDR circuit, a tri-mode cell can be configured as a GVCO, a divide-by-2 divider, or 2 DFFs. Moreover, improvements are made to address the problem associated with the extra time delays that reduce the sampling margin.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523138","","CMOS logic circuits;Clocks;Delay effects;Latches;Logic circuits;Multiplexing;Phase locked loops;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device measurement;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;optical burst switching;optical fibre networks;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS technology;GVCO/Div2/DFF tri-mode cells;PON standards;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s;bit rate 20 Gbit/s;bit rate 5 Gbit/s;data packets;fast-locked CDR circuit;gated voltage controlled oscillator;multiband BMCDR circuit;passive optical network;power-scaling burst-mode CDR circuit;size 90 nm","","5","2","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a subretinal light sensitive chip, the natural optical system of the eye is still used, allowing the patient to intuitively locate objects. The patient was 1 out of 7, who have been implanted in a clinical study in 2006 in Tuebingen, Germany (E. Zrenner et al., 2007). The space beneath the retina is limited. Either just an electrode array is placed there (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), or a silicon chip thinned to about 70mum, or both. The experiments (E. Zrenner et al., 2007) used a device including a light-sensitive CMOS chip and separate direct stimulation electrodes. The device was connected to an external power supply by a polyimide-ribbon (comparable to (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), however much longer), forming a flexible connection into the eyeball. Feasibility of the wired supply approach for humans was proven; no perception of the ribbon was reported by the patients.

IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","358","619","This paper introduces a fully integrated 2x2 two-stream MIMO radio SoC that integrates all of the functions of an 802.11n WLAN. The 0.13 mum CMOS radio SoC, which integrates two dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) RF transceivers, analog baseband filters, data converters, digital physical layer, media access controller, and a PCI Express interface, provides a low-cost low-power small-form-factor WLAN solution. The MIMO radio comprises two identical dual-band transceivers that share a common frequency synthesizer capable of operating in both integer-N and fractional-N modes. In 2.4 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a direct-conversion architecture with a 3.2 GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Direct conversion is used primarily because of its simplicity and the area reduction it offers by eliminating the need for an IF path. A 3.2 GHz synthesizer frequency is used to avoid VCO pulling. The 3.2 GHz synthesizer output f<sub>vco</sub> is divided by two and then mixed with the original 3.2 GHz f<sub>vco</sub> to generate a 4.8 GHz frequency. This 4.8 GHz signal at twice the RF frequency is distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver, the 4.8 GHz signal is divided by two to generate the 2.4 GHz in-phase and quadrature LO signals. In the 5 GHz mode, the transceiver uses a sliding-IF dual-conversion architecture, in which the RF and IF LO signals are centered at 2/3 fRF and 1/3 fRF, respectively. The frequency synthesizer, operating in integer-N mode, thus provides a 3.2 GHz RF LO signal that is buffered and distributed to both transceivers. Within each transceiver a resistively loaded divide-by-two circuit is used to generate the quadrature LO signals at 1/3 fRF. The channel center frequencies in the 5 GHz band allow integer-N operation of the synthesizer with a relatively high reference frequency, thus improving the phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523205","","Baseband;Digital filters;Dual band;Frequency synthesizers;MIMO;RF signals;Radio frequency;Signal generators;Transceivers;Wireless LAN","CMOS integrated circuits;MIMO communication;system-on-chip;transceivers;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN;VCO pulling;direct conversion architecture;dual-band CMOS MIMO radio SoC;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency 5 GHz;size 0.13 mum;synthesizer frequency;transceivers","","21","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is promising for this purpose. A PWM pixel can convert light intensity to a digital pulse width by using an in-pixel comparator with a low power-supply voltage without any degradation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a low-power dynamic pixel readout in-pixel comparators(DPR) scheme with CGA PWM pixels based on dynamic operation of in-pixel comparators. DPR requires no static bias current even in the pixel readout. The power dissipation of the pixel array is dramatically reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with using normal static pixel readout (SPR).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523053","","Biomedical imaging;CMOS image sensors;CMOS logic circuits;Cameras;Communication system security;Logic circuits;Low voltage;Pixel;Pulse width modulation;Space vector pulse width modulation","CMOS image sensors;comparators (circuits);pulse width modulation;readout electronics","DPR;PWM CMOS imager;SNR;SPR;dynamic pixel readout;in-pixel comparators;pixel array;pulse width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;static pixel readout;submicron logic circuits;voltage 1.35 V","","5","","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They also offer higher-frequency performance than SC modulators as no critical opamp settling is required. CT modulators with low OSR have achieved a DR greater than 75 dB in a 20 MHz band. However, they all suffer from inaccurate active filtering as filter time constants are set by RC and C/Gm values that vary by as much as plusmn20 to 30%. By lowering OSR, the signal band can be widened, but the in-band zero of the NTF should be optimally placed to maximize the DR. Inaccurate NTF zero either degrades the DR or makes the modulator unstable. This work presents an exact time-constant auto-tuning method using an LMS algorithm. With a binary pulse dither injected into the loop at the input of the quantizer, the filter time constant can be calibrated continuously with crystal accuracy until the correlated residual pulse dither disappears in the digital output.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523276","","Active filters;Bandwidth;Capacitors;Delay;Digital filters;Feedback loop;Frequency;Power harmonic filters;Pulse modulation;Sampling methods","CMOS integrated circuits;continuous time systems;delta-sigma modulation;tuning","CMOS technology;automatic tuning;bandwidth 8 MHz;continuous time delta-sigma modulators;pulse injection;size 65 nm","","3","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analog on-sensor processing solutions feature image sensor integration. However, the precision loss of analog signal processing prevents those solutions from realizing complex algorithms, and they lack flexibility. Vision processors realize high GOPS numbers by combining a processor array for parallel operations and a decision processor for other ones. Converting from parallel data in the processor array to scalar in the decision processor creates a throughput bottleneck. Parallel memory accesses also lead to high power consumption. Privacy is a critical issue in setting up visual sensors because of the danger of revealing video data from image sensors or processors. These issues exist with the above solutions because inputting or outputting video data is inevitable.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523179","","Algorithm design and analysis;CMOS image sensors;Hardware;Image sensors;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent vehicles;Man machine systems;Medical services;Signal processing algorithms;Surveillance","CMOS image sensors;parallel memories;system-on-chip;video signal processing","CMOS image sensor;GOPS/W vision processor;SoC;analog on-sensor processing;analog signal processing;iVisual;intelligent visual sensor;parallel memory access;video analysis","","11","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This structure copes with both 50 Omega output resistance, and small output capacitance. The choke in the pre-power-amplifier (PPA) is also eliminated by adopting a push-pull amplifier and by using a modified envelope signal injection biasing scheme.

An extra phase is needed, but, surprisingly, there is no speed penalty when compared to a high-gain opamp solution because CLS does not require full settling during the next-to-last phase. In fact, the increased signal swing means that the same SNR can be achieved using smaller sampling capacitors. Thus, it could be argued that CLS can provide accurate results at a higher speed than using a traditional 2-phase operation with a high-gain opamp. For example, with CLS, the performance is maintained over the whole 0.9V supply, whereas a standard configuration has only a 0.6V swing. Thus, the standard configuration requires 2.25x larger sampling capacitors to achieve the same signal to kT/C noise ratio.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523296","","Capacitors;Distortion measurement;Performance gain;Phase estimation;Rails;Sampling methods;Semiconductor device noise;Signal to noise ratio;Solid state circuits;Voltage","amplification;capacitors;operational amplifiers","correlated level shifting;finite opamp gain;high-gain opamp solution;loop gain;rail-to-rail operation;sampling capacitors","","7","4","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Single-Chip Tri-Band WCDMA/HSDPA Transceiver without External SAW Filters and with Integrated TX Power Control","Tenbroek, B.; Strange, J.; Nalbantis, D.; Jones, C.; Fowers, P.; Brett, S.; Beghein, C.; Beffa, F.","MediaTek, West Malling","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008. ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","202","607","With growing WCDMA adoption there is a strong demand to reduce the cost of WCDMA terminals. Contributing to the relatively high WCDMA terminal cost is the low integration of today's WCDMA radios. Since WCDMA is an FDD system the transmitter and receiver are on simultaneously. A duplexer is used to isolate the receiver from the transmit signal but the isolation of small low-cost duplexers is limited, with a guaranteed isolation at the TX frequency of not more than 52dB. For a Class-3 terminal with 2dB TX path loss due to duplexer and switch, the power at the PA output is +26dBm and the receiver will see a TX leakage of up to -26dBm. Today's state-of- the-art WCDMA transceivers deal with the TX blocking problem by using an external TX SAW filter to eliminate TX noise in the RX band and an external LNA and RX SAW filter to achieve sufficient RX linearity. A typical tri-band transceiver requires 6 SAW filters and 3 LNAs. The tri-band WCDMA transceiver presented here eliminates all external SAW filters and LNAs and achieves excellent performance with standard low-cost duplexers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523127","","Baseband;Calibration;Current supplies;Detectors;Multiaccess communication;Power control;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Receivers;SAW filters;Transceivers","code division multiple access;multiplexing equipment;power control;transceivers","FDD system;RX SAW filter;RX band;RX linearity;TX blocking problem;WCDMA transceivers;external LNA;external SAW filters;integrated TX power control;single-chip triband WCDMA-HSDPA transceiver;small low-cost duplexer;triband transceiver","","35","15","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a trade off between these two requirements, as the use of resonant loads offers high power efficiency while an inductor-free approach saves die area resulting in a cheaper design. Since an LC-oscillator topology is mandatory to achieve a minimal current draw, the reduction of the number of coils has to be done in the LNA, the mixer and the quadrature generator. In this work, starting from the LNA-Mixer and VCO (LMV) cell topology, a single-coil low-power receiver shares the bias current among all the RF blocks of the analog front-end. The receiver prototype chip consumes 3.6mW and has an active die area of 0.35mm<sup>2</sup>.

More than 1 and 2 ENOB reductions are observed in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007) and Kuttner, F., (2002), respectively, because of thermal noise, and degradations could be even worse with scaled supply voltages and the extensive use of dynamic regenerative latches without pre-amplification.

The use of alternative energy sources also requires ULV operation in some applications. Achieving sufficient linearity with low power consumption is very challenging for the ULV mixer and baseband circuits. The on-chip LO generation and distribution is difficult due to the low-voltage device bias. We present optimized mixer and filter topologies, and a polyphase LO buffer, used in a low-power ULV receiver for 2.4GHz applications like Bluetooth or Zigbee. The use of spiral inductors is kept to a minimum to avoid their excessive area.

"130dB-DR Transimpedance Amplifier with Monotonic Logarithmic Compression and High-Current Monitor","Micusik, D.; Zimmermann, H.","Tech. Univ. Vienna, Vienna","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008. ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090109","2008","","","78","597","Receiving a high-power optical signal using a linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is often a very difficult task. Large input photocurrents saturate the TIA and make it insensitive to the input signal. This is especially a problem for optical sensing applications, in which the input photocurrent usually has a very wide dynamic range (DR). Various methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. The 2-stage compression concepts described here significantly improve. The DR is increased by 18 dB compared and by 10 dB. Moreover, the compression is monotonic over the full input current range. The proposed TIA responds linearly to the input currents that are smaller than the first break-point current, while larger currents are logarithmically compressed to avoid the saturation of the TIA. The lower bound on the input DR is given by the equivalent RMS input-noise and it is affected by the TIA transimpedance, which is set by the feedback resistor in the TIA. However, the BW is indirectly proportional to the transimpedance of the TIA, and therefore its minimum of 250 MHz is in the linear region, in which the overall transimpedance. Using the 2-stage compression concept, we simultaneously achieved a low equivalent RMS input-current noise of 58 nA and a very-high overdrive of 200 mA. This concept is also well suited for LAN technologies, optical data-storage systems, wireless IR links and free-space optics.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523065","","High power amplifiers;Monitoring;Optical amplifiers;Optical feedback;Optical noise;Optical saturation;Optical sensors;Photoconductivity;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Stimulated emission","amplifiers;optical information processing;optical sensors;photodiodes","2-stage compression;dynamic range transimpedance amplifier;high-current monitor;high-power optical signal;monotonic logarithmic compression;optical sensing application","","0","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-resolution TDCs become increasingly popular for time-of-flight measurements, full-speed testing, e.g., jitter measurement, clock and data recovery, measurement and instrumentation, and digital PLLs. As the speed leverage of technology scaling decreases below 100nm, robust TDCs with sub-gate-delay resolution are essential. The Vernier TDC requires long delay lines, thus suffers from large latency, area and power consumption. Latency and a resolution limited by the inherent variation-related pulse-width modification are the drawbacks of the pulse-shrinking approach. Parallel gradual-delay elements are particularly susceptible to process variations. The same holds for analog operations on time intervals like delay amplification. Ultra high-resolution TDCs achieve sub-ps resolution but require iterative conversion.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523300","","Clocks;Delay lines;Energy consumption;Instruments;Interpolation;Jitter;Pulse amplifiers;Robustness;Space vector pulse width modulation;Testing","analogue-digital conversion","Vernier TDC;clock recovery;data recovery;delay amplification;delay lines;digital PLL;energy 19 pJ;iterative conversion;jitter measurement;local passive interpolation;mixed-signal functionality;on-chip characterization;parallel gradual-delay elements;process variations;pulse-shrinking approach;single-shot precision;size 90 nm;sub-gate-delay resolution;time 4.7 ps;time-of-flight measurements;time-to-digital converter;variation-related pulse-width modification","","26","6","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Fully Digital 65nm CMOS Transmitter for the 2.4-to-2.7GHz WiFi/WiMAX Bands using 5.4GHz ΔΣ RF DACs","Pozsgay, A.; Zounes, T.; Hossain, R.; Boulemnakher, M.; Knopik, V.; Grange, Sebastien","STMicroelectron., Geneva","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008.

The baseband signal is upsampled first to a sampling rate F<sub>M</sub> around 160MHz, using FIR interpolators. I/Q and DC precompensation is then applied, to eliminate the image and LO components at the RF output. A first fine digital gain stage controls the signal level in a 0 to -12 dB range. The baseband signal is then upsampled to F<sub>c</sub>/4, where F<sub>c</sub> is the carrier frequency in the 2.4 to 2.7 GHz range. As the ratio between F<sub>c</sub>/4 and FM is not necessarily integer, a fractional-N interpolator has to be used. The interpolating ratio has 17 bits of resolution, which allows carrier frequencies on a 25 kHz raster, to satisfy all possible WiFi and WiMAX channel allocations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523206","","Baseband;Channel allocation;Digital control;Finite impulse response filter;Image sampling;Mobile handsets;Radio frequency;Radio spectrum management;Transmitters;WiMAX","CMOS digital integrated circuits;WiMax;digital-analogue conversion;mobile handsets;radio transmitters","2G mobile handsets;3G mobile handsets;DC precompensation;FIR interpolators;RF transmitter;WiFi/WiMAX bands;carrier frequency;delta-sigma RF DAC;digital CMOS transmitter;digital-analog conversion;fractional-N interpolator;frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.7 GHz;frequency 5.4 GHz;size 65 nm","","12","2","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Otherwise, it may lead to degraded waveform fidelity and reduced eye-mask margin. Conventional LDDs implement the passive back-termination with on-chip resistors due to its simplicity (H.M. Rein et al., 1994). However, the passive termination resistor inevitably becomes an additional load for the output driver, which results in significant decrease of the modulation current range.To enable low-cost and flexible CMOS solutions, this paper presents a low-voltage design topology of active back-termination by incorporating the design techniques described above.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523137","","Circuit topology;Driver circuits;Equations;Impedance;MOS devices;Optical reflection;Radio frequency;Resistors;Transmission lines;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;network topology;semiconductor lasers","CMOS;active back-termination;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;laser-diode driver;low-voltage design topology;optical transmitter;size 0.18 mum","","1","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has resulted in many recent initiatives to fabricate CMOS-based microelectrodes for the stimulation and recording of electrical activity of neurons. CMOS technology offers the potential for monolithic integration of sensors and electronics and it serves as an appropriate platform to facilitate the integration of large arrays of sensors into a small geometry. The extracellular pH of a cell culture is a particularly important indicator of global cellular metabolism, but up until now, this property has typically been measured with invasive and expensive techniques such as miniaturized glass microelectrodes, fluorescent ratio imaging microscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CMOS provides a scalable, low cost, mass manufacturing platform, and offers the potential to develop sensor arrays that can perform non-invasive and long term imaging on cultured cells. In this paper, we present the first 16x16 proton camera array for direct imaging of the hydrogen-ion activity of cell cultures grown in vitro. The proton camera is based on a single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) sensor array technology that can be implemented using a standard commercial CMOS process.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523321","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Cameras;Extracellular;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic sensors;Microelectrodes;Protons;Sensor arrays;Silicon","CMOS image sensors;biosensors;cellular biophysics;ion sensitive field effect transistors;microelectrodes","CMOS proton camera array;CMOS-based microelectrodes;cell culture;cultured cells;direct extracellular imaging;electrical activity;extracellular pH;global cellular metabolism;hydrogen-ion activity;long term imaging;microelectronics industry;monolithic integration;noninvasive imaging;silicon CMOS technology;single-chip ion-sensitive field-effect transistor sensor array technology","","5","70","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fingerprint identification using capacitive fingerprint sensing provides small user-authentication systems. For systems that need a higher level of security, fraud detection, which determines whether the sensed finger is alive or not, is necessary. Integrating fraud detection capability into a capacitive sensor is important because attempted fraud has to be detected at the same time that the fingerprint is captured. Various methods that use information about a finger, such as its electrical characteristics, optical characteristics or elastic characteristics, have been tried. Impedance-sensing is suitable from the viewpoint of using electrical signals. An impedance-sensing circuit should not increase the chip size nor degrade the quality of the captured fingerprint image. To meet these requirements, we propose an impedance-sensing scheme built into a capacitive sensor and implemented as a circuit and electrode without changing the chip size.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523111","","Capacitive sensors;Circuits;Degradation;Electric variables;Fingerprint recognition;Fingers;Image matching;Impedance;Information security;Optical sensors","capacitive sensors;electric impedance measurement;fingerprint identification;fraud;image sensors","artificial finger;capacitive fingerprint sensing;capacitive sensor;elastic characteristics;electrical characteristics;electrical signals;fingerprint identification;fingerprint sensor;impedance sensing;integrating fraud detection;optical characteristics;user-authentication systems","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate a 2Mb 2T gain-cell macro with 128GB/s bandwidth, fast 2ns cycle time, operating at 2GHz in a native 65nm logic process. Fast read access and cycle times are critical in lookup applications such as tag RAMs in microprocessors where read queries are abundant. In such a scenario replacing SRAM with a denser fast memory is desired. The 2T fully pipelined gain-cell macro features non-destructive read, partial-write support and sustains 8-cycle successive access to the same memory bank. The macro is fabricated in a high-performance 65nm process featuring 1.2nm nitrided gate oxide, 35nm gate length, enhanced channel strain, NiSi silicide, 8 layers of Cu metal interconnect, and low-K ILD enabling data-buses from the memory banks to run as high as 2GHz. This technology has a 0.57 mum<sup>2</sup> 6T SRAM cell. All internal circuits of the macro operate with a logic-compatible nominal IV supply with the exception of wordline drivers.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523163","","Bandwidth;Capacitive sensors;Costs;Driver circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Silicides;Silicon","SRAM chips;logic design","2T fully pipelined gain-cell macro;2T gain-cell memory macro;6T SRAM cell;cycle times;frequency 2 GHz;logic process;lookup applications;memory bank;nitrided gate oxide;read access time;silicon technology;size 65 nm;storage capacity 2 Mbit;time 2 ns;wordline drivers","","11","2","7","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While eDRAMs have 2.5x to 4x density compared to SRAMs and have lower soft-error rate they are slower in operation. In a conventional DRAM with a single column access device for read and write, a write operation is started only after the bitline sense amplifiers are turned on and the bitlines are well on their way to full restoration. This is to avoid destroying data due to premature access to global bitlines in the non-writing columns. This delay in the write operation increases row cycle time to allow the storage node to be fully written. Accelerating write cycle with early access only in the required columns requires a large area penalty because local sense amplifiers in one bank are usually grouped into a large block where all control signals are shared. Also an embedded DRAM in a standard 65 nm twin-tub SOI CMOS process that uses a local sense amplifier with V<sub>DD</sub> sensing and separate ports for read and write, with these operations synchronized with sensing is described. This eDRAM speeds up the row cycle with low area overhead by reducing the number of signals to control the ports and making write and read operations indistinguishable at the bank level.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523161","","Built-in self-test;Capacitors;Graphics;Random access memory;Reservoirs;Testing;Timing;Tin;Turning;Variable structure systems","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip","SoC integration;bitline sense amplifier;frequency 500 MHz;random-access embedded DRAM macro;size 65 nm;storage capacity 1 Mbit;twin-tub SOI CMOS process","","11","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is seen that in the band where the distributed effect of the DA is in action, the ratio of the forward to reverse gain is substantial (and depends on the number of stages used). The input and output blocks are connected to this core stage to provide matching and stability This method is different from other techniques that improve gain (e.g., cascade of DAs or matrix amplifier) in that it uses a new internal feedback to fed signals go through one DA twice. The input, core and output DA blocks consist of 4/3/3 gain elements respectively except that the core DA uses series input capacitances at the gates for BW enhancement and biasing purposes. Terminations Z<sub>x</sub> and Z<sub>y</sub> are chosen to minimize undesired reflections. The input and output biases are fed through appropriate bias tees. The lower cutoff of the DA is set at 12 GHz for our application in a wideband mm-wave imaging module. This frequency could be extended to frequencies close to 1 GHz if appropriate AC-coupling capacitors are used.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523124","","CMOS technology;Distributed amplifiers;Feedback;Frequency measurement;Impedance;Noise figure;Phased arrays;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device modeling;Topology","CMOS integrated circuits;distributed amplifiers;feedback amplifiers;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave imaging;wideband amplifiers","AC-coupling capacitor;CMOS;DA;broadband distributed amplifier;frequency 660 GHz;internal feedback;wideband mm-wave imaging module","","12","","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An 800MHz -122dBc/Hz-at-200kHz Clock Multiplier based on a Combination of PLL and Recirculating DLL","Gierkink, S.","Conexant Syst., Red Bank, NJ","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2008. ISSCC 2008. Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","454","627","DLL clock multipliers outperform their PLL counterparts in terms of phase noise because they have significantly less jitter accumulation [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reducing dark current has also been challenging for such CIS imagers.

Recent work has shown the use of SC-filtering techniques in radio receivers, where sampling is done early in the RX path. Such discrete-time architectures require an early anti-aliasing (AA) filter prior to sampling. Multiple AA and channel filters with decimation stages have been used to strongly attenuate alias and adjacent channels and to allow sampling of the signal at a reasonable rate at the ADC stage.IF amplifiers are necessary to drive ADC input stage. The direct-conversion receiver architecture proposed here is based on a fully-passive CMOS approach.

There is a simple solution, namely, a Cartesian I-Q upconverter followed by a linear power amplifier, but for complex modulations its power conversion efficiency is often under 10%. Therefore, the search continues for a more efficient solution. One possibility is to harness the high efficiency of a saturated power amplifier but somehow make it deliver amplitude-modulated waveforms. Polar modulation has found use in enabling EDGE on GSM handsets, but we believe outphasing, or linear amplification using nonlinear components (LINC), offers a more enduring solution for a broader class of modulations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523310","","Capacitors;Degradation;GSM;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Switches","amplitude modulation;power amplifiers;radio transmitters;software radio","Cartesian I-Q upconverter;EDGE;GSM handsets;amplitude-modulated waveforms;linear amplification;linear power amplifier;nonlinear components;outphasing power amplifier;polar modulation;power conversion efficiency;saturated power amplifier;software-defined radio transmitter;universal modulator","","31","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike many previously published low-power high-speed ADCs based on time-interleaved SAR, this ADC has only 2 clock-cycle latency (1.6ns at 1.25GS/s) and achieves 6b performance without any digital post-processing or off-line calibration, making it a plug- in replacement for conventional flash ADCs in many applications.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523297","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS process;Calibration;Capacitors;Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Frequency;Magnetic recording;Sampling methods","CMOS logic circuits;analogue-digital conversion","6b resolution;SAR ADC;UWB receivers;clock-cycle latency;deep-submicron digital CMOS process;fash ADC;gigahertz sampling frequency;high-speed digital logic;lower power consumption;magnetic recording systems;power 32 mW;serial links;size 0.13 mum","","2","3","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An SoC for mobile phones defines 23 hierarchical power domains but most of the power domains are assigned for peripheral IPs that mainly use low-leakage high-V<sub>t</sub> transistors. Since high-performance multiprocessor SoCs use leaky low-V<sub>t</sub> transistors for CPU sections, leakage power savings of these CPU sections is a primary objective. We develop an SoC with 8 processor cores and 8 user RAMs (1 per core) targeted for power-efficient high-performance embedded applications. We assign these 16 blocks to separate power domains so that they can be independently be powered off. A resume mode is also introduced where the power of the CPU is off and the user RAM is on for fast resume operation. An automatic parallelizing compiler schedules tasks for each CPU core and also performs power management for each CPU core. With the help of this compiler, each processor core can operate at a different frequency or even dynamically stop the clock to maintain processing performance while reducing average operating power consumption. The compiler also executes power-off control of unnecessary CPU cores.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523071","","Automatic control;CMOS technology;Clocks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Frequency synchronization;Leakage current;Optimizing compilers;Registers;Resumes","embedded systems;logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallelising compilers;random-access storage;system-on-chip","8640 MIPS SoC;CPU core;RAM;automatic parallelizing compiler;embedded application;hierarchical power domain;high-performance multiprocessor SoC;mobile phones;power efficient SoC design;power management;power-off control;processor cores","","12","","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using quarter-circle shaped electrodes, similar to an ultrasonic motor, multiple output voltage phases are obtained from a single resonating piezoelectric disk. Two-electrode transducer outputs are often rectified using a full-wave diode bridge rectifier, which requires a significant voltage drop between input and output, decreasing the rectifier's voltage efficiency. Previous asynchronous rectifiers use MOS switches to avoid the diode drop, however they lack the ability to efficiently rectify the multiple output phases generated from a disk-shaped transducer. Other CMOS rectifiers need two input waveforms that are equal and opposite, which a piezoelectric transducer may not generate for many input vibrations.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523177","","Detectors;Electrodes;Frequency;Inverters;Piezoelectric transducers;Rectifiers;Solid state circuits;Switches;Threshold voltage;Vibrations","electrodes;piezoelectric devices;rectifying circuits","MOS switches;asynchronous full-wave rectifier;full-wave diode bridge rectifier;multiphase piezoelectric energy harvesters;multiple-electrode disk-shaped piezoelectric generator;piezoelectric disk;ultrasonic motor;voltage drop","","10","1","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A switching pre-regulator is usually followed by a low dropout (LDO) regulator to provide a regulated power source for noise-sensitive blocks. The LDO regulator has to be stable for all load conditions and frequency compensation is usually needed to stabilize the regulation loop. The output voltage droop due to rapid and large load changes could be minimized with a fast regulation loop, such that functional blocks powered by the same LDO regulator would have low crosstalk noise. A low-voltage fast transient-response LDO regulator using an inexpensive 0.35 mum CMOS process is presented in this paper. It features a current-efficient adaptively biased regulation scheme using a low-voltage high-speed super current mirror and does not require a compensation capacitor. It is stabilized by a low-cost low-ESR ceramic filter capacitor of 1 muF The adaptively biased error amplifier EA drives a small transconductance cell to modulate the output current through a transient-enhanced super current-mirror (SCM).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523247","","Application specific integrated circuits;CMOS process;Capacitors;Crosstalk;Energy management;Frequency;Integrated circuit noise;Regulators;Transient response;Voltage control","CMOS integrated circuits;amplifiers;crystal filters;transient response;voltage regulators","adaptive biased CMOS LDO regulator;adaptive biased error amplifier;crosstalk noise;low-voltage high-speed super current mirror;multiple voltages control;power management IC;size 0.35 mum;switching preregulator;transient response;voltage 0.9 V","","11","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, NAND flash has the potential to replace HDDs. To achieve larger capacity while maintaining low cost per bit, technical improvements in feature size and area reduction are essential. To meet the stringent requirements, we develop a 16 Gb 4-level NAND flash memory in 43 nm CMOS technology. In 43 nm generation, gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) influences the electrical field on both sides of NAND strings. GIDL causes severe program disturb problems to NAND flash memories. To avoid GIDL, two dummy wordlines (WL) on both sides of NAND strings are added. This is effective because the dummy gate voltages, are selected independent of the program inhibit voltage.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523241","","CMOS technology;Character generation;Costs;Decoding;Driver circuits;Nonvolatile memory;Routing;Switches;Variable structure systems;Voltage","CMOS logic circuits;NAND circuits;flash memories","CMOS technology;GIDL;NAND flash memory;WL;dummy wordlines;gate-induced drain leakage;size 43 nm","","2","6","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Miniature as well as micro-machined thermoelectric generators (TEG) can become a suitable compact power supply for both on-the-body and industrial sensors. To minimize the overall size of the power supply, the generator has to work at its maximum power point. Due to varying thermal conditions, the generated power and voltage are not constant. Typically the output voltage is lower than the power supply voltage of the sensor. For these reasons, a power management circuit (PMC) with maximum power-point tracking capability and containing a DC/DC-converter with variable conversion factor is required that stores the generated energy in a rechargeable battery or capacitor.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523176","","Circuits;Electrical equipment industry;Electricity supply industry;Power generation;Power supplies;Sensor systems;Thermal sensors;Thermoelectricity;Voltage;Wireless sensor networks","DC-DC power convertors;power supply circuits;thermoelectric conversion;wireless sensor networks","DC/DC-converter;ambient environmental energy;capacitive power-management circuit;capacitor;compact power supply;electrical energy;energy scavenging;industrial sensors;micromachined thermoelectric generators;micropower thermoelectric generators;on-the-body sensors;power 2.1 muW;power energy-autonomous wireless sensor systems;rechargeable battery;thermal conditions;variable conversion factor","","1","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventionally, injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) , Miller frequency divider, and CML static divider are widely used in various applications. Among these dividers, the ILFD has the highest operation frequency, but the locking range is limited. On the other hand, the static FD covers a wide locking range, but its operation frequency is low and the power consumption is usually high. Since a FD connected to a VCO operates at the highest frequency, the power dissipation and the locking range of a VHF FD should be carefully considered. In a PLL, due to the process and temperature variations, the locking range of the ILFD must be several times larger than the tuning range of the VCO. Thus, it is challenging to design a wide locking-range and low-power ILFD in the millimeter-wave applications. To achieve a higher operational frequency for an ILFD, the distributed LC oscillator is adopted. To widen the locking range of an ILFD, the transconductance-enhancement technique is presented. In this paper, two low-power ILFDs have a locking range of 85.1 to 96.3 GHz and 98.9 to 105.2 GHz, respectively.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523259","","CMOS technology;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Inductors;Parasitic capacitance;Power measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Spirals;Transconductance;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency dividers;phase locked loops","CMOS technology;ILFD;VHF;W-band frequency divider;frequency 85.1 GHz to 96.3 GHz;frequency 98.9 GHz to 105.2 GHz;injection-locked frequency divider;locking range;millimeter-wave applications;phase locked loops;power 3.5 mW;very-high-frequency PLL","","20","","8","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome the density limitation, an SRAM using a double- stacked S<sup>3</sup> (stacked single-crystal Si) SRAM cell was introduced for mobile applications. This work demonstrates a high-speed SRAM using double-stacked-cell. From the process point of view, our design uses fully proven technologies for mass production at the sacrifice of cell size.From a circuit-design perspective, three schemes are introduced. They are automatic cell bias (ACB) for managing the current of SRAM cell transistors by controlling cell bias, adaptive block redundancy (ABR) for dealing with various defects from the new cell technology, and wordline pulse-width regulation (WPR) for adjusting wordline pulse-width according to cycle time.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523219","","Adaptive control;Automatic control;Cache memory;Circuits;Mass production;Multicore processing;Programmable control;Random access memory;Space vector pulse width modulation;Technology management","SRAM chips;integrated circuit design","adaptive block redundancy;automatic cell-bias;circuit design;frequency 500 MHz;memory size 72 MByte;multi-core processors;size 100 nm;synchronous SRAM cell;wordline pulse-width regulation","","1","","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the device performance, circuit design and measurement determine the divider high-speed and wide frequency range performance. One of the uncertainties in CML static divider measurement is pulling and locking hysteresis. By using CML static divider topology, the divider has been assumed to have a fixed wide operation range, from DC to the f<sub>div</sub> <sub>,</sub> <sub>max</sub>, the maximum input-referred divider operational frequency. In fact, the CML static dividers show a certain degree of locking hysteresis, similar to injection-locking dividers.

By resonating the large global clock capacitance with an inductance, the energy used to charge the clock node each period can be recycled within the LC tank network, resulting in lower clock power. Additional power savings are realized by reducing the strength of clock drivers because only losses need to be overcome at resonance. Skew and jitter are improved due to the bandpass characteristic of the LC network and the use of fewer clock buffering stages. We describe how the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE) processor is experimentally transformed to have a resonant-load global clock distribution similar to the one in (Chan et al., 2004).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523282","","Capacitors;Clocks;Frequency;Inductors;Jitter;Power measurement;Resonance;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing;Voltage","clocks;microprocessor chips","LC tank network;bandpass characteristic;cell broadband-engine processor;clock buffering stages;clock drivers;clock node;global clock power;large global clock capacitance;resonant clocking techniques;resonant global clock distribution;timing uncertainty","","5","1","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These converters have to combine the stringent speed specifications with the demand for low power consumption. Flash architectures are often chosen because they offer the largest speed. However, in this architecture, area and power depend exponentially on the resolution since the comparators are often the largest contributor to the overall power consumption. Folding is a well-known technique used to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high speed. It was previously implemented by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers, often in combination with interpolation or averaging. In this design, a folding factor of 2 is realized as in but with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers. This reduces the number of comparators from 31 to 16 for a 5b resolution.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523152","","CMOS technology;Calibration;Clocks;Energy consumption;Frequency;Inverters;MOS capacitors;Routing;Switches;Voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits)","comparators;digital CMOS technique;folding flash ADC;low power consumption;power 2.2 mW;size 90 nm;wireless receivers;wireless standards","","30","4","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optical techniques, based on voltage- and calcium-sensitive dyes or photouncaging, along with multi-photon fluorescent microscopy have proven very successful in imaging activity in slices and in vivo. However, studies have been limited by the ability to stimulate different regions of tissue with enough spatial resolution and throughput. Traditional stimulation is accomplished with passive multielectrode arrays (MEAs) or bipolar electrodes. In both cases, a relatively small number of stimulation sites with coarse spatial resolution are possible. While there has been recent work on the development of CMOS chips for extracellular recordings of cultured neurons or slices on planar electrodes, the focus of this work is on stimulation and achieving stable electrical interfaces between acute slices and a high-density active CMOS MEA. As brain slices preserve many synaptic connections, they are ideal preparations to study neuronal microcircuits in vitro.

In a polar transmitter, high-efficiency non-linear power amplifiers can be used for linearly modulated waveforms. Because of envelope bandwidth expansion in polar modulated transmitters, the design of a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency supply modulator is one of the most challenging aspects of a polar transmitter. The most common technique for providing wide-bandwidth low-noise supply modulation in a linear system PA is by using linear low-dropout regulators, however at backed-off power levels their efficiencies are low. Envelope tracking is another common technique for transmitter design. Although this technique relaxes the bandwidth requirement of the supply modulator, it uses a less efficient linear power amplifier. A parallel combination of linear and switch-mode regulators for a polar PA is proposed. A similar topology for EDGE PA regulators has been proposed.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523250","","Degradation;Delay;Feedback loop;High power amplifiers;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Regulators;Transmitters;Voltage","HF amplifiers;code division multiple access;low noise amplifiers;modulation;power amplifiers;radio transmitters","CDMA transmitter;PA-supply regulator;frequency 10 MHz;high-linearity power amplifier system;polar modulation","","16","1","4","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Range and velocity resolutions of the FMCW radar are determined by the band width and period of triangular modulation (Pourvoyeur et al., 2008). A short-range measurement requires wide (several GHz) bandwidth, while a long-range measurement with high-velocity resolution requires moderate (hundreds of MHz) bandwidth and long (several ms) period. Furthermore, since frequency error in the FMCW signal deteriorates range and velocity accuracy, a highly linear frequency chirp signal is required. However FMCW radars reported so far exhibit a period up to 1.5ms because a long period degrades the chirp linearity in a conventional analog PLL. In this work, an analog/digital mixed-mode 82GHz FMCW synthesizer with 1.5GHz bandwidth, a period from 1ms to 10ms and less than 180kHz<sub>rms</sub> frequency error is described. The achieved performance corresponds to range and velocity resolutions of 10cm and 1.4km/h, respectively.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746324","","Bandwidth;Frequency modulation;Low pass filters;Phase locked loops;Synthesizers;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;CW radar;FM radar;chirp modulation;frequency synthesizers;millimetre wave radar;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;radar resolution","CMOS radar IC;FMCW radar;FMCW signal;analog/digital mixed-mode FMCW synthesizer;bandwidth 1.5 GHz;chirp linearity;conventional analog PLL;frequency 26 MHz;frequency 82 GHz;frequency error;frequency modulated continuous-wave radar;high-velocity resolution;highly linear frequency chirp signal;long-range measurement;mm-wave radar application;range resolution;short-range measurement;time 1 ms to 10 ms;triangular modulation;velocity accuracy;velocity resolutions","","7","","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Session 24: Special Evening Session highlights of ISSCC 2008","Thewes, Roland","Qimonda, Germany","Electron Devices Meeting, 2008. IEDM 2008. IEEE International","20090227","2008","","","1","1","In this Special Evening Session four outstanding papers published at the 2008 International Solid-State Circuit Conference (ISSCC) are presented to the IEDM audience. All papers are focused on the idea that circuit-technology interaction plays an important role for numerous applications, and that related circuit designs gain benefit from thorough technology understanding and vice versa. In the first paper by Fatih Hamzaoglu et al., from Intel, utilizing a 45nm high-k metal-gate CMOS technology, special emphasis is put on design-based solutions to deal with stability and leakage issues of a 153Mb SRAM with 0.346μm<sup>2</sup> cell area. Careful body biasing and implementation of sleep transistor techniques enable achievement of these goals. Whereas the first paper focuses on mainstream logic applications, the second paper by Joachim Burghartz et al., from IMS CHIPS, discusses CMOS imager chips for in-vivo biomedical purposes. A sub-retinal CMOS imager implant is shown to restore vision of patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, an endoscopy camera chip using an amorphous α-Si layer above standard CMOS is demonstrated. The last two papers highlight novel approaches for non-volatile memories. Ki-Tae Park et al., from Samsung, Korea, describe a multi-level 4Gb NAND Flash device in 45nm technology. High area efficiency is achieved by using two stacked Si layers providing 2Gb each. Architecture and operation issues are discussed with respect to cell properties in this 3D arrangement. The last paper by Ferdinando Bedeschi et al., from Numonyx, considers a phase-change memory approach combining the properties of non-volatility and fast read and write access. A 256Mb multi-level test-chip is presented based on a 90nm microtrench technology and using Ge<inf>2</inf>Sb<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>5</inf> as the phase-change material.","8164-2284","978-1-4244-2377-4","978-1-4244-2378-1","10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796758","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796758","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Circuit stability;Circuit synthesis;High K dielectric materials;High-K gate dielectrics;Paper technology;Random access memory;Sleep;Solid state circuits","","","","0","","","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A digitally controlled DC-DC buck converter with lossless load-current sensing and BIST functionality","Tao Liu; Hyunsoo Yeom; Vermeire, B.; Adell, P.; Bakkaloglu, B.","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2011 IEEE International","20110407","2011","","","388","390","Lossless load current sensing ability is one of the most desirable features of contemporary current-or voltage-mode-controlled DC-DC converters. Current sensing can be used for short circuit detection, multi-stage converter load balancing, thermal control, and load-independent control of DC-DC converters (Woo et al., 2008). Recently, current sensing techniques using the existing inductor series DC resistance (DCR) are gaining attention due to their reduced complexity and minimized loss. These techniques increase the need for inductor build-in self test (BIST) ability to measure DCR. Inductor BIST is also critical for high-reliability applications such as automotive and aerospace systems where component variation and drift need to be closely monitored. An analog inductor characterization and current sensing technique utilizing Gm-C filtering is proposed in [2], where the gain errors and sensing offset are cancelled in analog domain. The DC-DC buck converter presented here uses an offset-independent inductor characterization enabling a digital continuous lossless load-current-sensing scheme. The proposed inductor BIST and current-sensing techniques can be extended to current-mode-controlled converters and multi-stage parallel converters as well.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746288","","Built-in self-test;Converters;Current measurement;Generators;Inductors;Sensors;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;built-in self test;current-mode circuits;digital control;inductors","BIST functionality;Gm-C filtering;aerospace systems;analog domain;analog inductor characterization;automotive systems;component variation;contemporary current--mode-controlled DC-DC converters;digital continuous lossless load-current-sensing scheme;digitally controlled DC-DC buck converter;gain errors;inductor BIST;inductor build-in self test ability;inductor series DC resistance;load-independent control;multistage converter load balancing;multistage parallel converters;offset-independent inductor characterization;sensing offset;short circuit detection;thermal control;voltage-mode-controlled DC-DC converters","","9","","4","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Figure 14.1.1 shows the 0.154μm<sup>2</sup> bitcell (BC). A 2x size reduction from the previous 45nm design (Pilo et al., 2008) is enabled by an equal 2x reduction in BC area. No corner rounding of BC gates allows tighter overlay of gate electrode and active area. The introduction of HKMG provides a significant reduction in the equivalent oxide thickness, thereby reducing the Vt mismatch. This reduction allows aggressive scaling of device dimensions needed to achieve the small area footprint. A 0.7V VDD<sub>MIN</sub> operation is enabled by three assist features. Stability is improved by a bitline (BL) regulation scheme. Enhancements to the write path include an increase of 40% of BL boost voltage. Finally, a BC-tracking delay circuit improves both performance and yield across the process space.","0193-6530","978-1-61284-303-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746307","","Arrays;Delay;High K dielectric materials;Logic gates;Neodymium;Random access memory;Regulators","SRAM chips;silicon-on-insulator","BC-tracking delay circuit;SRAM;Si;active area;assist features;bitcell BC gates;bitline regulation scheme;boost voltage;equivalent oxide thickness;gate electrode;high-k metal-gate SOI technology;process space;read-ability enhancements;size 32 nm;storage capacity 64 Mbit;voltage 0.7 V;write path;write-ability","","16","6","5","","","20-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
