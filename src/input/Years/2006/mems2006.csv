Unfortunately, this device, which is critical for lowering intracranial pressure, has a substantial failure rate (40% in the first year). A leading cause of failure is the obstruction of the ventricular catheter. The goal of this project is to design a ventricular catheter that will resist occlusion through the use of micromachining and micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. We designed, fabricated, and tested magnetic microactuators. The theoretical results show that the fabricated microactuators can produce the force necessary to remove an adherent cellular layer grown over the actuator surface. By integrating the microactuators into the catheters, we hope to produce an improved catheter with the ability to actively combat the health-threatening occlusion process","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","1-4244-003303","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4462301","","Catheters;Cranial pressure;Medical treatment;Microactuators;Micromachining;Micromagnetics;Micromechanical devices;Resists;Surgery;Testing","biological fluid dynamics;brain;catheters;microactuators;micromachining;micromechanical devices;neurophysiology;paediatrics;patient treatment","MEMS-enabled ventricular catheter;adherent cellular layer;cerebrospinal fluid shunt;health-threatening occlusion process;hydrocephalus;intracranial pressure;magnetic microactuator;micro electromechanical systems;micromachining;patient treatment;substantial failure rate;surgical implantation","","6","","18","","","Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The actuator is driven by a combination of PZT actuator for slider thrust and electrostatic comb drive for slider grip. Incremental step size is precisely adjustable to tens of nanometer level by controlling PZT actuator voltage. Large stroke is obtained by repeating the operation sequence numerous times. Large stroke exceeding 600μm has been demonstrated. There is no conceivable limit to the stroke except for the length of the slider and external load.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627902","","Electrostatic actuators;Hydraulic actuators;Laboratories;Lightweight structures;Microactuators;Mirrors;Propulsion;Space missions;Space technology;Telescopes","","","","1","","9","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our prism consists of two plates facing each other and liquid sandwiched between the plates. By changing the angle between the two plates, the liquid and the two plates form into the wedge shape. We used electrowetting to change the angle of the prism. The wedge prism keeps the size small, since the liquid driven by electrowetting works as a prism. In addition, the prism keeps the view clear because the optical flatness of the wedge prism is determined by the flatness of the two plates.

The 1mm × 2mm microphone diaphragm is made of polysilicon and has stiffeners and carefully designed hinge supports to ensure that it responds like a rigid body on flexible hinges. The diaphragm is designed to respond to pressure gradients, giving it a first-order directional response to incident sound. This mechanical structure is integrated with a compact optoelectronic readout system. The directivity measurements show the expected figure-8 directivity pattern with a 21dB difference between the maximum and minimum at the first diaphragm resonance frequency of 2 kHz.

In the sensor presented here an Electrolyte-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon structure is used as an electrochemical potential-to-capacitance transductor. The electrochemical potential at the Electrolyte-Nitride interface is linearly dependent on the electrolyte pH. Therefore, the resonant frequency of the LC resonator will follow the electrolyte pH variations. A double electrode scheme, one for stable DC potential and another for low AC impedance, has been adopted in order to obtain sufficient Q at the resonator. A sensitivity of 1.2% frequency change per pH unit has been achieved.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627836","","Capacitance;Capacitive sensors;Chemical sensors;Electrical resistance measurement;Electrodes;Fabrication;Impedance;Inductance;Resonant frequency;Wireless sensor networks","","","","1","","5","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once the target microbe is trapped at the focal point of the laser manipulator, we can easily realize exclusion of excess microbes by controlling the electric field, while keeping the target trapped at the focal point. To realize an efficient separation system, we made a new separation cell by microfabrication. We show experimental results on our system. We also propose indirect manipulation methods by the micro-tools to avoid direct laser radiation to the target. Some preliminary experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness.

In the experimental study, we fabricate two different microdiffuser prototypes, having the neck widths of 100 μm (D100) and 300 μm (D300), respectively. The prototypes, D100 and D300, show the maximum net flow rates of 116.6 μl/min and 344.4 μl/min, respectively, for an identical piezoelectric flow actuation using the sinusoidal drive voltage of 100 V p-p at 50 Hz. The flow rates measured from D100 and D300 are approximately 47% of the theoretical values estimated from the conventional unidirectional flow model for the net boundary layer thicker than the neck width. The experimental flow rate of D300, however, decreases from 47% of the theoretical values at the flow frequencies higher than 90 Hz, at which the net boundary layer thickness is reduced to the microdiffuser neck width.

Thus, the electrode acts as a ""gate"" for liquid flow, in analogy with a gate in a field-effect transistor. This paper describes the control of EOF by the synchronized switching of the gate potential with the channel axial potential. The advantage of this procedure is that potential gas formation by electrolysis at the electrodes that provide the axial electric field is suppressed, while the direction and magnitude of the EOF can be maintained. The results show that the flow velocity is linearly dependent on the applied gate potential and varies with the phase difference between the applied gate and channel potential.

Our idea is to integrate the magnetic separator with a microfluidic mixer to ensure that all beads are brought close to the magnetic structures. We have fabricated a magnetic separator consisting of permalloy elements adjacent to a microfluidic channel. The performance of a system with an integrated surface structured (staggered herringbone) microfluidic mixer is compared to that of an equivalent system without the mixer.

As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable.

When the proximity mode detects the contact of any objects, the sensor will switch its mode into tactile sensing mode for acquiring an image from an object. We have used the same platform that we developed for the tactile sensor which was presented in the last MEMS conference [ 1]. In the current work, we have assessed if the existing platform is suitable for dual implementation. We have tested various designs and configurations in a simple PCB fixture in order to determine the proper electrode configuration of the proximity sensor. We found that the best detection range has been obtained from the largest electrodes with the smallest gap. This implies that the dual implementation is quite plausible in the original tactile sensor platform which has a 1 mm gap between electrodes and 22 mm in length.

The potential applications of this device include performance improvement of SAW micro-sensors, front-end components in RF circuitries, and directional receptions of high frequency acoustic waves. Analogous to the band-gap generated by photonic crystals, the phononic crystals, two dimensional repetitive structures composed of two different elastic materials, can prohibit the propagation of elastic waves with either specific incident angles or certain bandwidth. In this paper, the prohibited bandwidth has been verified by fabricating the phononic crystals between a micromachined SAW resonator and a receiver. Both the resonator and receiver are composed of IDT electrodes deposited and patterned on a thin piezoelectric layer. To confine the prohibited bandwidth on the order of hundred MHz, the diameter of the circular pores in phononic crystals is designed to be 6 micron and the aspect ratio of each pore is 3:1. To maximize the power transduction from IDT electrodes to SAW, the spacing between two inter-digits is one-fourth the wavelength of SAW. Specifically, the spacing ranges from 3.4 microns to 9.0 microns, depending on the central frequency. Both surface and bulk micromachining are employed and integrated to fabricate the crystals as well as SAW resonator and receiver altogether.

We have succeeded in improving the permittivity by 50% by mixing the dielectric oil with BaTiO3 nano-particles 30 nm in diameter at a rate of 15% Volume. In addition, as a result of assessing the sensor fabricated, we obtained a linear and analog output within an inclination angle range from -45 ~+45 deg. The detection resolution and the response speed were 0.1 deg or more and 0.79 sec/deg respectively. Based on these achievements, we attained a certain perspective to miniaturize inclination sensors while maintaining their performance at the level of conventional ones.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627897","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627897","","Acceleration;Capacitance;Capacitive sensors;Capacitors;Dielectrics;Electrodes;Gas detectors;Permittivity;Petroleum;Surface tension","","","","1","","5","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A porous alumina membrane allows for the diffusion of gas or liquid etchants through the nano-pores into the cavity to etch the sacrificial material, freeing the movable structures encapsulated inside. Subsequent vacuum sealing was achieved by depositing a thin film over the nano-porous alumina shell in a vacuum deposition tool, with no detectable penetration of the sealing material owing to the nano-pores with a high aspect ratio (> 30).

Flow switching is initiated by melting of paraffin using integrated heaters, with an additional pneumatic pressure used for flow switching from open to closed state. After paraffin solidifies the switched flow state is subsequently maintained without further energy consumption. The actuator can be fabricated from PDMS through the multilayer soft lithography technique.

Microparticles with different sizes can be successfully separated at different stages of squeezed sheath flows. Separated microparticles then flow into expansion channel blocks to enlarge the distance of the separated flow streams and are collected at different side channels. Only one high voltage is required for generating all the sheath flows for particle separation by applying a series of variable resister to create different electric field levels such that the system is simple and reliable. This study also adopts numerical simulation to analyze and predict the flow fields and stream lines within the microchannel. Experimental results show that the microchip is capable of continuously separating microparticles with the sizes of 5, 10 and 20 μm using the proposed squeeze-jumping effect. The method proposed in this study provides a simple way to continuously separate microparticles/cells with different sizes.

This result indicates energetic ions for physical sputtering and for enhancing chemical reactions are required to etch materials which produce nonvolatile reaction products.

As 3D multiple-step structured nozzles are required for straight and high frequency ink ejection, it was formed by ICP deep-RIE employing a “multiple-step mask method” which makes troublesome stereo-photolithography unnecessary and 128 nozzles/chip were fabricated simultaneously. The required thin, 2 μm-thick pressure plates were formed by B doped etch-stop technology combined with two-step alkaline etching which enables smooth-surfaced and uniform (2.15±0.35 (3 σ)μm) pressure plates. The typical driving voltage is 26.5 V and the SEAJet head has achieved the uniform ink ejection up to a driving frequency of 18 kHz. The life of the actuator has been confirmed to be more than 4 billion times actuation. The typical printing speed of the POS printer is 15 1/s (lines per second) for a rolled paper and 3 ppm (papers per min.) for A4 paper in 360 dpi (dots per inch) high resolution, a performance level that makes this the fastest inkjet POS printer in the world.

A typical switch actuation with a step function voltage results in an contact impact force 5 times greater than the static force, increasing the adherence force and the rate of change of the shape of the contact.

The filter is a 3-pole, 500 fractional bandwidth, bandpass filter centered at 31.75 GHz, consisting of three capacitively coupled resonators composed of half coaxial transmission lines, which are connected to input and output transitions designed to interface with external CPW probes for measurement.

Furthermore, we have developed a wafer-level cantilever transfer process, which requires only one step of cantilever transfer process to integrate the CMOS circuit with the cantilevers. Using this process, we have fabricated a single thermo-piezoelectric Si<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>cantilever, and recorded 65nm data bits on a PMMA film. And we have successfully applied this method to transfer 34X34 thermo-piezoelectric Si<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>cantilever arrays on a CMOS wafer. Finally, We obtained reading signals from one of the cantilevers.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627951","","Bonding processes;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Heat transfer;Integrated circuit technology;Memory;Sensor arrays;Silicon;Substrates;Thermal sensors","","","","1","","10","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hydrophilic degree on the well surface is critical for controlling the film uniformity in the dynamic evaporation process, in particular around the rib of well. Experimental result indicates that the higher hydrophobicty (contact angle above 90°) on well surface yields flatter film profile during droplet evaporation inside a well, thus promotes a more uniform solute deposition.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627768","","Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Ink;Optical films;Optical microscopy;Printing;Shape measurement;Solvents;Substrates;Surface morphology","","","","1","","10","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Located on a steel diaphragm of 300 µ m radius and 23 µ m average thickness, it is intended to aid in tissue differentiation, providing information that is complementary to any imaging method that may be used concurrently. The sensor is fabricated from bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT) using a customized process. Micro electro-discharge machining is used to form a steel tool that is subsequently used for batch-mode ultrasonic machining of bulk PZT ceramic. The resulting sensor is 50 µ m thick and 200 µ m in diameter. Devices were tested in materials that mimic the texture of human tissue in the training of physicians, and were separately tested with porcine fat and muscle tissue. The magnitude and frequency of a resonant peak shows tissue-specific characteristics as the needle is inserted into tissue. For example, in the porcine tissue sample, the magnitude and peak frequency respectively change from ≈2118 Ω and ≈163 MHz to ≈562 Ω and ≈150 MHz as the needle moves from fat to muscle tissue.","1084-6999","0-7803-9475-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627724","","Biopsy;Biosensors;Machining;Materials testing;Microsensors;Muscles;Needles;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Steel;Ultrasonic imaging","","","","0","","9","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the interdigitated-castellated microelectrodes, the induction of a mutually attractive dielectrophoretic force between cardiac myocytes can lead the cells moving close to each other and forming a tissue-like structure with orientation along the AC electric field between the electrode gaps. Both experimental results and theoretical analysis have indicated that a large orientation torque and force can be achieved by choosing an optimal frequency and decreasing the conductivity of the medium to a low level, where the orientation torque weakly depends on the frequency.

The beams are 250 µ m in length, 20 µ m in thickness, 8 µ m in width. By etching an appropriate pattern onto the wafer, additional exposed surfaces for doping can be created where vertical dope-sites are needed.

They made their first appearance in semiconductor fabs in the sixties. Our daily life is full of micromachined products. When we awake in the morning we step in the car to drive to office and many active and passive safety systems, like vehicle dynamic control and air bag, using acceleration and yaw rate sensors, protect our lives. Moreover, car gasoline consumption is very low also thanks to the use of pressure sensors in engine manifolds and fuel lines. When we arrive in the office, most of times we have to print a document, thus using a cheap and fast inkjet printhead, where hundreds of micromachined chambers eject the ink on the paper. Then, we attend a meeting, where a small and compact video-projector, using millions of micromachined mirrors, displays on the wall a shiny and sharp image. But our unconscious interaction with micromachiend products doesn't stop here, it goes on all the day along. MEMS are manufactured in semiconductor fab like the transistors we find in the electronic chips sold every year, but in this case not only electrons are moving. Membranes, cantilever and fluids are the the main moving actors. And thus MEMS reliability assessment methodology has to take into account additional potential failures modes of moving parts. MEMS compete with non-semiconductor based solutions in price and performances. But miniaturization is definitely another big advantages they bring to the consumer market.

The effectiveness of the assembly process of fine parts using tele-manipulation and augmented reality is confirmed by some experiments. In the experiments, by adjusting the workspace in the operator side and the assembly area side using scaling factor in the motion command from haptic device to robot manipulator, and also reaction force occurred in the assembly area to haptic device, the assembly process can be conducted effectively.

MSMD are systems mixing different domains such as analog and digital electronics, radio-frequency modules, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), micro-optical-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) and others on the same chip (system-on-chip: SoC) or in the same package (system-on-package: SoP). The heterogeneity of such systems can be seen at different abstraction levels. In fact this heterogeneity is mainly due to the multiphysic domains and also to the nature of the signals available on the chip. The creation of a virtual prototype of such microsystems is very useful because it allows to significantly shorten the design cycle and to reduce the design cost. Due to different domains, the mixed signals, the several non-linearities of the electrical components or MEMS devices and the interdependences of their subsystems, it is very complex to make a global simulation and optimization with traditional approaches and with the same simulator. Several modelling languages can be used, for example SPICE and VHDL-AMS, but one of the major disadvantages of these languages concerns the convergence of the simulation. MATLABreg/Simulinkreg is a powerful environment where several subsystems can be modelled with analytical equations, electrical circuits, etc. In this paper, we apply our approach to model and to simulate a self powered micro systems (SPMS) in this simulation environment. Several simulation results, made with different abstraction levels, have been compared and are in very good agreement. Moreover, we report in this paper cosimulation results obtained with Simulinkreg/SMASHtrade software.

The lifetime of sensor networks is still limited as individual sensor nodes are usually powered by battery. In the past few years, the use of relay nodes in sensor networks has been proposed in literature for balanced data gathering, reduction of transmission range, connectivity and fault tolerance. In hierarchical sensor networks, higher-powered relay nodes can also be used as cluster heads. These relay nodes may form a network among themselves and route data towards the base station. In such a sensor network, the lifetime of the network is directly related to the lifetime of these relay nodes. In this paper, we have proposed an ILP solution for scheduling the data gathering of relay nodes such that the lifetime of the relay node network is maximized. We have compared our formulation with the direct transmit energy model and shown that it can lead to significant improvements.

The ban of lead has caused a switch to lead-free solders rather than to isotropically conductive adhesives (ICAs), even if the latter posses many valuable qualities. The reason from manufacturing perspective is the minimum amount of changes in equipments and processes. ICAs have also reliability concerns since they have less resistance against loads from damp heat and impact stresses than tin-lead or lead-free solders. However, the future phone or accessory functionalities may require the use of MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors). With MEMS some ICA advantages over solders become important.

By using the available information of the linear bending stiffness for MEMS, the bending characteristics of the SMM MEMS cantilever test structure can be evaluated analytically. Results obtained from the analytical modeling have been compared with results from finite element analysis (FEA) using CoventorWare where the present analytical modeling showed good agreement with results obtained through FEA, establishing the methodology superiority. It is apparent that the finite anchor stiffness presence due to the non-rigid effect yields significant difference on the deflections of the SMM MEMS test structures while the effect of self-weight is negligible. It is thus deemed a necessity that the anchor's flexibility should be incorporated in order to achieve good accuracy of the analytical modeling. This study also showed that the present analytical modeling is restricted to be employed only in the linear range. This is due to the fact that as the displacement increases, the geometrically nonlinear effect becomes conspicuous corresponding to the small deflection theory used to generate the analytical modeling.","","0-7803-9730-4","0-7803-9731-2","10.1109/SMELEC.2006.381038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266588","","Analytical models;Automatic testing;Fabrication;Finite element methods;Information analysis;MIMO;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Structural beams;System testing","bending;cantilevers;micromachining;micromechanical devices;surface treatment","CoventorWare simulation;aluminum cantilever;bending characteristics;finite anchor stiffness;linear bending stiffness;microelectro-mechanical systems;nonrigidity effects;self-weight effects;surface micromachined MEMS test structures","","0","","12","","","Oct. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an intelligent control framework that utilizes MEMS-based (micro-electro-mechanical systems) `Smart Dust motes' wireless platforms is explored. Due to their small size, they can be placed directly on the worksurface. As a result, illuminance estimation and maintenance is significantly improved.

Usually the classical softwares use a staggered methodology iterating between two different codes to obtain the solution of the coupled problem. In this research a strong coupled formulation is proposed and a tangent stiffness matrix of the whole problem is computed. Using this matrix, nonlinear algorithms such as the Riks-Crisfield algorithm may be applied to solve the static nonlinear problem and determine accurately the static pull-in voltage. Moreover, the natural frequencies may be computed around each equilibrium positions. The dynamic behaviour of the structure may also be studied and two new parameters are defined: the dynamic pull-in voltage and the dynamic pull-in time. This strong coupled methodology deriving from variational principle may also be used for topology optimisation and extended finite elements","","1-4244-0275-1","","10.1109/ESIME.2006.1643965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643965","","Capacitors;Couplings;Electrodes;Equations;Fluid dynamics;Frequency;Micromechanical devices;Springs;Vibrations;Voltage","electromechanical effects;finite element analysis;micromechanical devices","MEMS;Riks-Crisfield algorithm;electro-mechanical coupling;extended finite elements;nonlinear algorithms;static nonlinear problem;tangent stiffness matrix;topology optimisation","","0","","7","","","24-26 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20070402","2006","","","1576","1581","Autonomous aerial vehicles need to navigate as well as control themselves in real time without any human intervention. This requirement imposes an immense pressure on the processing powers as well as the accuracy of sensors used for navigation. Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have payload and power constraints that prohibit use of highly accurate sensors and powerful processors. This paper presents implementation of an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) using low cost micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) sensors and field programmable gate array (FPGA). This hardware implementation of AHRS has enabled us to achieve attitude update rate of 20.0 micro seconds necessary for high speed control loop with power consumption of 110 mW. The target FPGA used for this work is Xilinx Spartan III x3csl500 which provides sufficient logic for implementation of AHRS algorithm. The work presented here is the first step towards a dedicated guidance chip for MAVs that will be able to navigate as well as control an MAV autonomously. Simulation and hardware implementation results were compared with Crossbow's AHRS400 which show that the design is suitable for implementing AHRS for MAVs and small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).","","1-4244-0570-X","1-4244-0571-8","10.1109/ROBIO.2006.340179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4142101","Attitude and Heading Reference System;Field Programmable Gate Array;Guidance Chip;Micro Aerial Vehicles","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Humans;Mechanical sensors;Mobile robots;Navigation;Payloads;Remotely operated vehicles;Sensor arrays;Unmanned aerial vehicles","aircraft;field programmable gate arrays;microrobots;microsensors;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles","AHRS400;FPGA;Xilinx Spartan III x3csl500;attitude and heading reference system;autonomous aerial vehicles;field programmable gate array;guidance chip;micro electro mechanical system sensors;microaerial vehicles","","1","","15","","","17-20 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
