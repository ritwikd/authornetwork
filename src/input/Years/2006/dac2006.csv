In this work we propose a logic and layout aware approach for voltage assignment and voltage island generation in placement process to minimize the number of level converters and to implement voltage islands with minimal overheads. Experimental results show that our approach uses much less level converters than the approach in (Bin Liu, 2006) (reduced by 59.50% on average) when achieving the same power savings. The approach is able to produce feasible placement with a small impact to traditional placement goals.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.358063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196109","","Added delay;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Dynamic voltage scaling;Electronic design automation and methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic design;Power generation;Scattering;Threshold voltage","integrated circuit layout;logic CAD","layout aware voltage island generation;level converters;low power design;placement process;voltage assignment","","4","","13","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Improving Voltage Assignment by Outlier Detection and Incremental Placement","Huaizhi Wu; Wong, M.D.F.","Atoptech Inc., San Diego","Design Automation Conference, 2007. DAC '07. 44th ACM/IEEE","20070625","2007","","","459","464","Design for low power has become a key requirement in today's SoC design, especially for mobile applications. Multi-Vdd is an effective method to reduce both leakage and dynamic power. In a multi-Vdd design, cells of different supply voltages are often grouped into a small number of voltage islands, in order to avoid complex power supply system and excessive amount of level shifters. Recently, Wu et al. (2005) proposed an elegant algorithm for voltage island grouping based on the physical proximity of the critical cells in a post- placement voltage assignment, and Wu et al. (2006) proposed an efficient algorithm for voltage assignment which not only meets timing but also forms good proximity of the critical cells. However, due to insufficient slack, a few isolated critical cells (called outliers) may still exist in the resulting voltage assignment, causing disproportionately expensive penalty to the final voltage island grouping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the voltage assignment by automatic outlier detection followed by incremental placement. The outlier detection is based on a modified algorithm for the facility location problem. The incremental placement is guided by setting proper constraints on the paths containing the detected outliers, such that the outliers can be eliminated later. Our experiments on industry designs show that our algorithm leads to 12% - 54% improvement in the final voltage island grouping, with quick turn around time.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261228","Algorithms;Design;Low power;Outlier;Placement;Voltage assignment","Algorithm design and analysis;Contracts;Costs;Delay;Design optimization;Low voltage;Power supplies;Routing;Timing","logic design;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","SoC design;facility location;incremental placement;low power design;mobile application;multiVdd design;outlier detection;supply voltage;voltage assignment;voltage island grouping","","2","","10","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a good quadratic placement, followed by local wirelength-driven spreading can produce excellent results on large-scale industrial ASIC designs. As opposed to the current top performing academic placers [4,7,11], RQL does not embed a linearization technique within the solver. Instead, it only requires a simpler, pure quadratic objective function in the spirit of [8,10,23]. Experimental results show that RQL outperforms all available academic placers on the ISPD-2005 placement contest benchmarks. In particular, RQL obtains an average wire- length improvement of 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.4%, 8.5%, and 14.6% versus mPL6 [5], NTUPlaceS [7], Kraflwerk [20], APlace2.0 [11], and Capo10.2 [18], respectively. In addition, RQL is three, seven, and ten times faster than mpL6, Capo10.2, and APlace2.0, respectively.

Asia and South Pacific","20070507","2007","","","250","255","Because of the increasing dominance of interconnect issues in advanced IC technology, it is desirable to incorporate global routing into early design stages to get accurate interconnect information. Hence, high-quality and fast global routers are in great demand. In this paper, we propose two major techniques to improve the extremely fast global router, FastRoute (Pan and Chu, 2006) in terms of solution quality : (1) monotonic routing, (2) multi-source multi-sink maze routing. The new router is called FastRoute 2.0. Experimental results show that FastRoute 2.0 can generate high-quality routing solutions with fast runtime compared with three state-of-the-art academic global routers FastRoute, Labyrinth (Kastner et al., 2000) and Chi Dispersion router (Hadsell and Madden, 2003). On the set of benchmarks used in Pan and Chu, 2006 and Hadsell and Madden (2003), the total overflow of FastRoute 2.0 is 98, compared to 1012 (FastRoute), 2846 (Labyrinth) and 1271 (Chi Dispersion Router). The runtime of FastRoute 2.0 is 73% slower than FastRoute, but 78times and 37times faster than Labyrinth and Chi Dispersion router. The promising results make it possible to integrate global routing into early design stages. This could dramatically improve the design solution quality.","","1-4244-0629-3","1-4244-0630-7","10.1109/ASPDAC.2007.357994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196040","","Clocks;Delay estimation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Runtime;Timing;Topology;Very large scale integration;White spaces;Wire","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections","FastRoute 2.0;advanced IC technology;design solution quality;extremely fast global router;high-quality routing solutions;monotonic routing;multisource multisink maze routing","","38","1","19","","","23-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An approximated preconditioner is proposed to resolve the difference between large macros and standard cells, while an annealing engine is devised to handle macro legalization followed by placement of standard cells. The above innovations are integrated into our placement prototype ePlace, which outperforms the leading-edge placers on respective standard-cell and mixed-size benchmark suites.

With the 2006 DAC conference doing a much-needed ""deep dive"" into how the semiconductor industry meets technical challenges, Joe Costello, Chairman of Orb Networks, Inc., will turn the spotlight away from technology and onto today's macro consumer trends. During this session, Joe challenges participants with this fundamental question: are you going in the right direction? As you bend your minds with the complexity of implementing modem day systems and chips, are you racing toward the right finish line? What are consumers really looking for? What will convergence really lead to and are you positioned to take advantage of all it will bring our industry and our world? Join Joe as he reveals lessons learned and offers a simple view of the future of electronics.","0738-100X","1-59593-381-6","","10.1109/DAC.2006.238672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688740","","","","","","0","","","","","24-28 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Test Generation in the Presence of Timing Exceptions and Constraints","Goswami, D.; Kun-Han Tsai; Kassab, M.; Rajski, J.","Mentor Graphics Corp., Wilsonville","Design Automation Conference, 2007. DAC '07. 44th ACM/IEEE","20070625","2007","","","688","693","Generating test patterns without considering timing exceptions and constraints can lead to invalid test responses, resulting in false failures on the tester or yield loss. A path-oriented approach to handle timing exception paths with setup violations during at-speed test generation has been presented in (V. Vorisek et al., 2006). This paper presents a unified and complete algorithm for computing test responses in the presence of timing exceptions with both setup and hold violations, and Boolean timing constraints. The new algorithm analyzes all possible effects of glitches in the circuit. It resolves pessimism in the case of multiple interacting timing exception paths. The new method significantly reduces the number of unknowns in the test responses, resulting in improved test coverage and test compression. The new method can be applied to 1) any fault model, 2) any test pattern, 3) any simulation environment, and/or 4) any test generator.","0738-100X","978-1-59593-627-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261271","Algorithms;DFT;Measurement;Reliability;SDC;Timing exceptions;Verification;false paths;multicycle paths;path sensitization;simulation;test generation;timing constraints","Circuit faults;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Clocks;Graphics;Integrated circuit reliability;Logic testing;Permission;Test pattern generators;Timing","Boolean algebra;automatic test pattern generation;constraint handling;integrated circuit reliability;logic testing;timing","Boolean timing constraints;fault model;path-oriented approach;simulation environment;test compression;test coverage;test pattern generation;timing exceptions","","1","4","12","","","4-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
