This design targets the same high speed and resolution while simultaneously achieving power efficiency previously associated only with low-speed, low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the power reported includes the consumption from the active reference generator, clock generator and encoder (since this is an industrial SoC), differentiating it from the majority of reported SAR ADCs. A dynamic residue amplifier with excellent noise-filtering properties, embedded in a pipelined architecture, is a key power-saving technique. In addition, an energy-efficient switched-capacitor (SC) DAC is obtained by using a small fraction of the total DAC capacitance during the initial SAR steps. The realized Walden FOM is 9.1fJ/conv-step while the Schreier FoM is 172.3dB, currently the highest reported number to date for sampling speeds greater than 0.1Ms/s, based on the extensive list of recent data converters compiled in [3].","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757399","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Noise;Switches;System-on-chip;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;digital-analogue conversion;flip-flops","CMOS;SNDR;Schreier FoM;SoC;Walden FOM;active reference generator;clock generator;data converters;dynamic residue amplifier;encoder;interleaved SAR-assisted pipelined ADC;noise-filtering;pipelined architecture;power 1.5 mW;power efficiency;power-saving technique;size 28 nm;successive approximation register;switched-capacitor DAC","","1","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Figure 4.5.2 shows the power train of the 2-phase ReSC converter. The architecture is similar to the 2:1 SC converters in [2-3], but uses inductance, L<sub>X</sub>, to resonate with the on-chip flying capacitor, C<sub>X</sub>. On-chip bypass capacitance, C<sub>bp</sub>, is used to filter the output voltage and complete the resonant loop in the energy transfer process. The timing of key signals in converter operation is shown in Fig. 4.5.3. In normal operation at the fundamental resonant frequency, ω<sub>o</sub>=(L<sub>X</sub>C<sub>X</sub>)<sup>-1/2</sup>, resonant impedance Z<sub>X</sub> is configured in parallel with Vin-Vout in φ<sub>1</sub>; in φ<sub>2</sub>, Z<sub>X</sub> is configured in parallel with Vout. If there is a voltage difference between Vin-Vout and Vout-GND, voltage V<sub>X</sub> appears as a square wave at the resonant frequency. In φ<sub>1</sub>, a positive half wave current flows into Z<sub>X</sub>, drawing energy from Vin; in φ<sub>2</sub>, a negative half wave current flows out of Z<sub>X</sub>, supplying energy to the load. Similar to the SC topology, this process can be modeled as an effective resistance, REFF, the details of which are discussed in [6]. Operation at the fundamental mode provides the lowest achievable R<sub>EFF</sub>, which is approximately R<sub>ESR</sub>·π<sup>2</sup>/8 for the 2:1 configuration, near the minimum achievable R<sub>EFF</sub> for a comparable SC converter.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757349","","Density measurement;Resistance;Resonant frequency;Switches;System-on-chip;Voltage control;Voltage measurement","network topology;resonant power convertors;switched capacitor networks","2-phase ReSC converter;2-phase resonant switched-capacitor converter;Li-Ion battery supply;SC topology;energy transfer process;fundamental resonant frequency;negative half wave current;on-chip bypass capacitance;on-chip flying capacitor;positive half wave current;power 4.3 W;resonant impedance;voltage 3.6 V to 6 V","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assistive listening devices based on miniaturized FM receivers [1] operating around 200MHz have been in use for more than 15 years by hearing impaired people. A wireless microphone worn by the speaker (e.g. the teacher in a classroom) captures the speaker's voice clearly and transmits it directly into the hearing aids. Assistive listening devices are essential for increasing speech understanding in noisy situations such as a restaurant, a classroom or a professional meeting. The evolution of FM systems for hearing impaired people has reached its limits and there is a need for a better system, eliminating frequency management by the user, providing worldwide operation, privacy of communication and better audio quality.

The external unit raises concerns with social stigma and limits usage in the shower or during water sports, motivating the need for a fully-implantable (i.e., invisible) cochlear implant (FICI). The limited energy storage capacity of the implanted system requires low-power (<;1mW total power) sound processing and auditory nerve stimulation to enable operation from an implanted battery that is wirelessly recharged only once daily. Recent state-of-the-art ICs are typically designed for external microphone-based CIs and do not require the neural stimulator to be on the same chip [1].

Due to the limited size of the battery (35 to 90mAh) especially for in-the-ear (ITE) and in-the-canal (ITC) types, a sub-mW transceiver is required for long operational time. A low-data-rate impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transceiver [1] achieves low power consumption with aggressive duty-cycled operation, namely 1%, but suffers from the bit-level synchronization problem by the baseband. Moreover, the low-data-rate IR-UWB exhibits a high peak transmission power to maintain a sufficient average transmission power for the given link margin. The constant-envelope frequency-modulated ultra-wideband (FM-UWB) system in [2,3] features a low peak voltage and a steep roll-off spectrum, but the lack of duty-cycled operation makes it difficult to achieve low power. Narrowband WBAN transceivers such as the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver [4,5] offer good compliance with existing wireless SoCs, but the sub-mW power consumption is not feasible and they have a potential coexistence problem with existing Bluetooth devices. In this paper, a chirp-FSK-based UWB transceiver is proposed to significantly reduce the peak transmission power with relaxed duty-cycled operation for noninvasive, energy-efficient, and agile short-range communications.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757382","","Band-pass filters;Chirp;Frequency shift keying;Receivers;Synchronization;Transceivers","body area networks;chirp modulation;frequency shift keying;hearing aids;low-power electronics;radio transceivers;synchronisation;ultra wideband communication","BLE;Bluetooth low energy transceiver;FM-UWB system;ITC types;ITE type;MP3 players;aggressive duty-cycled operation;agile short-range communications;audio channel;binaural hearing-aid devices;bit rate 1 Mbit/s;bit-level synchronization problem;chirp-FSK-based UWB transceiver;chirp-UWB transceiver;constant-envelope frequency-modulated ultrawideband system;duty-cycled operation;ear-to-ear link;energy constraints;fast synchronization capability;frequency 7.75 GHz to 8.25 GHz;in-the-canal type;in-the-ear type;link margin;low peak-power transmission;low power consumption;low-data-rate IR-UWB transceiver;low-data-rate impulse-radio ultrawideband transceiver;narrowband WBAN transceivers;power 1 mW;smart TVs;smart phones;sound signal processing;speech intelligence enhancement;steep roll-off spectrum;sub-mW transceiver;wireless SoCs;wireless links","","1","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the required phase noise, the in-band noise is typically suppressed by increasing CP current and loop filter size, while the out-of-band noise is reduced by improving VCO tank Q; both lead to increased die area. This paper presents a fractional-N synthesizer targeting the relatively stringent phase noise requirement to support 256-QAM and MIMO in 802.11ac. It deploys the following techniques to simultaneously address requirements of compact area, low noise and fast calibration: reuse of VCO inductor area for the loop filter; a PFD and CP design that relaxes CP design constraints without sacrificing noise; inductor-less LO generation for 802.11bgn mode; and an area-efficient reference clock doubler and associated calibration scheme. The synthesizer block diagram is shown in Fig. 28.2.1. In 802.11ac/a mode a frequency tripler followed by I/Q dividers realizes the 3/2 frequency multiplication and I/Q generation. In 802.11bgn mode, an LO generation circuit performs the 2/3 frequency multiplication and I/Q generation. This frequency plan features overlapping VCO tuning ranges between 802.11ac/a (F<sub>LO</sub>=4915~5825MHz) and 802.11bgn (F<sub>LO</sub>=2412~2484MHz) modes, such that the VCO designed for 802.11ac/a can support 802.11bgn without additional tuning range.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757518","","Capacitors;Clocks;Delays;Inductors;Noise;Phase locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency multipliers;frequency synthesizers;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless LAN","256-QAM;CMOS integrated circuits;CP current;I/Q divider;I/Q generation;IEEE 802.11ac;IEEE 802.11bgn;MIMO;VCO inductor area;VCO tank;VCO tuning;area-efficient reference clock doubler;fractional-N synthesizer;frequency multiplication;frequency synthesizer;frequency tripler;in-band noise;loop filter size;out-of-band noise;phase noise;size 0.29 mm;size 40 nm;synthesizer block diagram","","0","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And even though 1g fuel cells store 5 to 10× more energy than 1g Li-ion batteries, fuel cells supply 10 to 20× less power [1]. This means fuel cells last longer with light loads and Li-ion batteries output more power across shorter periods. Therefore, when the peak power is far greater than the average power, which, for example, is typically the case in wireless sensors, a hybrid source can occupy less space than a single source [1]. Still, managing a fuel cell and a battery to supply a load and recharge the battery, which also acts as an output, with little space is difficult. Switched-inductor circuits are appealing in this context because they draw and supply more power with higher efficiency than their linear and switched-capacitor counterparts. Inductors, however, are bulky, and thus microsystems can only rely on one inductor [2-3]. Today, most single-inductor multiple-output systems derive power from one source [3, 4, 6], and therefore, the fuel cell and the battery require considerable space. Systems that use two sources either do not manage how much power each source should supply across loading conditions [5], or if they do [2] their efficiency is low. The advantage of the prototyped 0.18μm CMOS dual-source single-inductor system presented here is its less overall volume because it incorporates the functional intelligence of [2] with much higher efficiency.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757487","","Batteries;Energy harvesting;Fuel cells;Hybrid power systems;Inductors;Pulse width modulation;Solid state circuits","CMOS integrated circuits;PWM rectifiers;battery chargers;fuel cells;inductors;secondary cells;voltage control","CMOS charger-supply;Li-ion batteries;adaptive on-time PWM control;dual-source single-inductor system;fuel cells;hybrid source;nested hysteretic;operational life;single-inductor multiple-output systems;size 0.18 mum;switched-inductor circuits;wireless sensors","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a prior work, a chip with limited AR functionality was reported that could perform AR with the help of markers placed in the environment (usually 1D or 2D bar codes) [3]. However, for a seamless visual experience, 3D objects should be rendered directly on the natural video image without any markers. Unlike marker-based AR, markerless AR requires natural feature extraction, general object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and camera-pose estimation to be performed in parallel. For instance, markerless AR for a VGA input-test video consumes ~1.3W power at 0.2fps throughput, with TI's OMAP4430, which exceeds power limits for wearable devices.

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V<sub>DDMIN</sub>. However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V<sub>DDMIN</sub> issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V<sub>DD</sub> to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V<sub>DDMIN</sub>: 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V<sub>DD</sub> (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V<sub>DD</sub> (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V<sub>DD</sub> operating region. A compariso- of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed. Figure 13.5.1(b) shows the layout view of the high-density 6T-SRAM bit-cell with 0.07μm<sup>2</sup> area in a 16nm high-k metal-gate FinFET technology. To minimize area, we set the geometric ratio of PU, PG, and PD transistors all equal to one.

All-digital PLLs have been proposed to address design issues in conventional analog PLLs. However, current all-digital PLLs require custom circuit design, and therefore cannot fully leverage advanced automated digital design flows. While fully synthesizable PLLs have been reported, they suffer from high power consumption and large area. This arises because each stage of the ring needs to have a large number of parallel tristate buffers/inverters in order to achieve the necessary frequency resolution. Moreover, custom-designed cells are required in prior synthesizable PLLs, introducing additional place-and-route (P&R) steps, leading to poor portability, integration, and scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fully synthesizable PLL based solely on a standard digital library, with a current-output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for maintaining frequency linearity and duty balance, an interpolative phase-coupled oscillator for minimizing the output phase imbalance from automatic P&R, as well as an edge injection technique for avoiding injection-pulse width issues.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757428","","Jitter;Logic gates;Oscillators;Phase locked loops;Power demand;Standards;Tuning","digital phase locked loops;digital-analogue conversion;integrated circuit design;oscillators","advanced automated digital design flows;all-digital PLL;clock generation;conventional analog PLL;current-output DAC;current-output digital-to-analog converter;custom circuit design;custom-designed cells;duty balance;edge-injection technique;frequency linearity;frequency resolution;fully synthesizable PLL;injection-pulse width issues;interpolative phase-coupled oscillator;modern digital systems;parallel tristate buffers/inverters;phase imbalance;phase-locked loops;place-and-route steps;power 780 muW;standard digital library","","0","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, analog outputs must be digitized by the back-end (BE) system [2,3]. Besides, parameter mismatch between AEs limits the overall CMRR.

Despite this progress, they lack the required sensitivity for passive imaging and imagers are in the need of artificial illumination to provide the required image quality. The choice has been to use expensive high-power focused illumination with a single direction for the incoming beam, which seriously limits the image quality due to its specular nature. Additionally, detectors in a focal-plane array configuration share the available source power and the image SNR further drops with the camera resolution.

Therefore, our DDR3 memory I/F design addresses this problem, relaxing the external environment requirements, especially relating to power integrity, and achieves 2.667Gb/s operation in a wirebond package and singleside mounted PCB. The difference between double-side and single-side mounted PCB is shown in Fig. 26.6.1. The capacitor on the PCB cannot be mounted directly near the SOC on the back side of PCB. This external environment increases the distance of the current return loop and also increases the inductance of power decouple capacitance equivalently.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757508","","Clocks;Jitter;Noise;Power dissipation;Regulators;Timing;Topology","DRAM chips;capacitance;lead bonding;printed circuit design","DDR3 memory I-F design;DDR3 memory interface;IP providers;PCB design constraints;SOC;bit rate 2.667 Gbit/s;capacitor;chip package type;double-side mounted PCB;external environments;inductance;package size;power decouple capacitance;power integrity;product risks;single-side mounted PCB;singleside mounted PCB;system board design;wirebond package","","0","","3","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such circuits also pose many challenges, such as increased delay, unwanted leakage paths and high sensitivity to variations. Working in advanced nanometer CMOS technologies compromises the robustness of circuits even more due to the increased variability. Nonetheless, these technologies offer higher operating frequencies for ultra-low-voltage circuits. Transitioning to smaller technologies is attractive for digital near-threshold circuits, provided that the impact of the increased variability can be mitigated. Few prior works have considered the design of variation-resilient ultra-low-voltage circuits in CMOS technologies smaller than 65nm. The aim of this work is to design a large system that advances the state-of-the-art by not only reaching very low energy consumption, but also clock frequencies of tens of MHz, while providing high variation resilience. We present a full JPEG encoder fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology, fully functional down to a supply voltage of 210mV. The JPEG encoder is able to operate at clock frequencies in a range from 5 to 275MHz for supplies from 210 to 550mV, and thus achieves very high ultra-low-voltage speed. At the minimum-energy point (MEP), the JPEG encoder consumes only 29.01pJ/pixel at an operating frequency of 41MHz (V<sub>DD</sub>=330mV). The variation (σ/μ) of 26 dies at this point is only 9.4% for the frequency and 6.0% for the energy consumption.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757511","","CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Clocks;Energy consumption;Logic gates;Quantization (signal);Transform coding","CMOS integrated circuits;data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;integrated circuit design;integrated logic circuits;threshold logic","1D-DCT;2D-DCT;40nm CMOS technology;JPEG image compression standard;MEP;advanced nanometer CMOS technologies;digital near-threshold circuits;discrete cosine transform;energy consumption;energy savings;frequency 5 MHz to 275 MHz;minimum-energy point;operating frequencies;variation-resilient near-threshold JPEG encoder;variation-resilient ultra-low-voltage circuits;voltage 210 mV to 550 mV","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One common way to overcome this drawback is to increase the driving voltage, which however results in an increase in system complexity and cost because it requires high-voltage circuits and devices. This SNR issue is resolved by driving the sensor channels in parallel [1,4] as shown in Fig. 12.3.1. Although the parallel drive mixes up the signals from the multiple channels driven at the same time, the original signals can be reconstructed from the sequence of mixed signals if the drive sequences are linearly independent from each other. By appropriately designing the parallel drive sequences, the SNR is enhanced by √M times compared to that of the sequential drive [1], where M is the number of drive channels. An analog front-end (AFE) IC capable of driving and sensing a 143×81 mutual-capacitance sensor is developed in 0.18μm 1P5M CMOS. A 32-inch and a 70-inch touch system are realized with the use of the AFE and an SNR over 37dB for 1mm diameter stylus is attained in either system.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757405","","Capacitance;Copper;Integrated circuits;Signal to noise ratio;Tactile sensors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;driver circuits;tactile sensors","1P5M CMOS;SNR;analog front-end IC;driving voltage;frequency 240 Hz;high-voltage circuits;mutual-capacitance touch-sensing system;sequential drive controllers;size 0.18 mum;size 1 mm;size 32 inch;size 70 inch;touch system","","0","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 1T1R ReRAM [1-3] fits embedded applications requiring fast read (RD) access time (T<sub>AC</sub>) and low RD-V<sub>DDMIN</sub>, particularly for devices powered by batteries or energy harvesters. The cross-point ReRAM [4-6] is meant for high capacities with high RD-V<sub>DDMIN</sub> and slow T<sub>AC</sub>. As devices shrink, ReRAMs have higher cell resistance (R) and greater variations in write time and R, which reduces the R-ratio (R<sub>H</sub>/R<sub>L</sub>) between the high-R state (HRS, R<sub>H</sub>) and low-R state (LRS, R<sub>L</sub>). ReRAM also have a high R<sub>L</sub>, which enables a larger voltage drop across ReRAM to reduce write voltage and cell-switch (CS) size. Thus, ReRAM macro designs suffer: (1) small sensing margin (SM), limited RD-V<sub>DDMIN</sub>, and slow T<sub>AC</sub> due to high-R<sub>L</sub> and small R-ratio; (2) increase in energy due to large set DC-current (I<sub>DC-SET</sub>) resulting from wide set-time (T<sub>SET</sub>) distribution. This study develops a swing-sample-andcouple (SSC) voltage-mode sense amplifier (VSA) to overcome (1), enabling 1.8× greater SM for lower RD-V<sub>DDMIN</sub> and 1.7× faster T<sub>AC</sub> across various V<sub>DD</sub>, compared to conventional differential-input (CD) VSAs.

Specifically, the energy in a PZT could be extracted more efficiently by utilizing resonance as [1] and [2] demonstrated. However, the maximum output voltage swing in those techniques are limited to twice of the original swing of the PZT, and thus, had a limited energy extraction capability in spite of more energy being available from the PZT.

To obtain far more power from PZT, we propose an alternative resonance technique through which the PZT output swing can be boosted as high as CMOS devices can sustain.

We present a 2.1-to-2.7GHz 860μW fractional-N ADPLL in 40nm CMOS for WPAN applications, which breaks the 1mW barrier and consumes at least 5× lower power compared to state-of-the-art ADPLLs.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757387","","Bluetooth;Delays;Frequency modulation;Phase locked loops;Power demand;Wireless personal area networks","CMOS integrated circuits;digital phase locked loops;frequency modulation;low-power electronics;personal area networks;time-digital conversion","RF PLL;TDC;ULP WPAN radios;ULP transceivers;WPAN applications;all-digital PLL;analog PLL;fractional-N ADPLL;frequency 2.1 GHz to 2.7 GHz;frequency modulation;frequency synthesis;nanoscale CMOS;power 860 muW;short-range networks;size 40 nm;sub-mW PLL;time-to-digital-converter;ultralow-power transceivers;wireless personal-area-network applications","","3","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Synthesizers based on the so-called multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) represent one of the most promising architectures in this direction [1-3]. An MDLL resembles a ring oscillator, in which the signal edge traveling along the delay line is periodically refreshed by a clean edge of the reference clock. In this manner, the phase noise of the ring oscillator is filtered up to half the reference frequency and the total output jitter is reduced significantly. Unfortunately, the concept of MDLL, and in general of injection locking (IL), is inherently limited to integer-N synthesis, which makes it unacceptable in practical RF systems. A first extension of injection locking to coarse fractional-N resolution has been shown in [4], in which however the fractional resolution is bounded to the inverse of the number of ring-oscillator delay stages. This paper introduces a fractional-N MDLL-based frequency synthesizer with a 1b time/digital converter (TDC), which is able to outreach the performance of inductorless fractional-N synthesizers. The prototype synthesizes frequencies between 1.6 and 1.9GHz with 190Hz resolution and achieves RMS integrated jitter of 1.4ps at 3mW power consumption, even in the worst-case of near-integer channel.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757469","","Delays;Frequency synthesizers;Inverters;Jitter;Noise;Quantization (signal);Synthesizers","delay lines;delay lock loops;frequency synthesizers;jitter;low-power electronics;phase noise;time-digital conversion","MDLL-based fractional-N frequency synthesizer;RMS integrated jitter;TDC;delay line;frequency 1.6 GHz to 1.9 GHz;inductorless fractional-N synthesizers;injection locking;integer-N synthesis;low power consumption;multiplying delay-locked loop;phase noise;power 3 mW;ring oscillator;time-digital converter","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since a single-inductor-multiple-output (SIMO) converter can support multiple output voltages while using only one inductor, it is an excellent candidate to minimize the component count and thus the production cost. However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5]. Although pseudo-continuous conduction-mode (PCCM) control with a freewheel period [1] tries to augment power density and eliminate cross-regulation, associated power dissipation of freewheel switch exacerbates its overall efficiency. The charge-control technique with energy recovery presented [2] decouples the output channels between each switching cycle, at the expense of additional switching loss and slow response. The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel. In addition, cross-regulation and slow response also limit the application of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique, which is widely used in single-output converters to improve the system power efficiency by providing variable voltage with fast reference tracking.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757347","","Inductors;Phase locked loops;Switches;Switching frequency;Voltage control;Voltage measurement","DC-DC power convertors;adaptive control;inductors;power control;switching convertors","DVS capable single inductor converter;DVS technique;PCCM control;accumulative error;associated power dissipation;battery longevity;charge control technique;comparator based controlled SIMO converters;cross regulation;dynamic voltage scaling;energy recovery;fast reference tracking;four output DC-DC buck converter;freewheel period;freewheel switch;inductor current;load capability;load regulation problem;portable devices;power consumption;power density;production cost;pseudocontinuous conduction mode;ripple based adaptive off time control;single inductor multiple output;single output converters;switching cycle;switching loss;system power efficiency","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

I/O pin limitations demand faster links at low power to enable integration of high chip-to-chip bandwidth. However, the channel losses and impedance discontinuities increase at high data rates making it difficult to equalize the channel at low power. In this work, we target reliable, differential, bi-directional links at 20 Gb/s over 6” FR4 PCB trace and flip-chip packages with a total loss budget of 20 dB at Nyquist. In a half-duplex link, one TX and RX are connected on each side and the link direction can be turned around by the controller. A link-turnaround latency of <;10 ns is achieved by placing several key circuits on standby when not in use and by designing fast bias circuits. When fast turnaround is not required, the circuits not in use are powered down permanently and the link is reduced to the simplex case. The top-level transceiver architecture is shown. An LC-VCO-based PLL oscillates at 20 GHz and generates quadrature I/Q clocks at 10 GHz. Both TX and RX use a half-rate architecture to optimize power. The clocks are distributed through an on-chip transmission line to 16 I/O lanes arranged in 2 rows. The links are capable of data rates as low as 14 Gb/s to save power when full bandwidth is not required.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757503","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Decision feedback equalizers;Finite impulse response filters;Latches;Receivers","CMOS integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;flip-chip devices;low-power electronics;phase locked loops;printed circuit interconnections;transceivers;voltage-controlled oscillators","CPUs;FR4 PCB trace;GPUs;I/O bandwidth;I/O pin limitations;LC-VCO-based PLL;bit rate 20 Gbit/s;channel losses;chip-to-chip communication;clock rate;fast bias circuits;flip-chip packages;frequency 10 GHz;frequency 20 GHz;half-duplex link;half-duplex serial link;half-rate architecture;high chip-to-chip bandwidth;high data rates;impedance discontinuities;loss 20 dB;on-chip transmission line;power 130 mW;processing power;quadrature I/Q clocks;reliable differential bidirectional links;size 28 nm;top-level transceiver architecture","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Broadband techniques such as inductive peaking are commonly used in highspeed optical transceivers for bandwidth enhancement at the expense of the chip area. Inductor-less receivers have been proposed [4,6] to reduce chip area but they usually consume more power or have lower data rates at given technology nodes.

Although a recent work successfully integrates an RF filter satisfying all the stringent specifications by current-domain signal flow from the LNA output to the baseband stage [5], the transconductance stage at the filter input is not linear enough to drive the high-power input and thus the input signal needs to be attenuated at the RF front-end, which eventually degrades system SNR.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757342","","Bandwidth;Harmonic analysis;Noise measurement;Radio frequency;Signal-to-noise ratio;TV;Tuners","low noise amplifiers;mixers (circuits);radiofrequency filters;television;tuning","3rd-order harmonics;5th-order harmonics;LNA;RF filters;RF front-end design;TV tuner systems;current-domain signal flow;external inductors;frequency 48 MHz to 870 MHz;harmonic rejection;mixer;noise figure 3.1 dB;transconductance stage","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Active-phase-count (APC) control, as proposed in [1-3], is the key technique that offers the wide load range, and dynamically adjusts the number of phases according to load conditions. However, an APC transition induces a voltage disturbance due to current redistribution among phases. This makes the APC control only suitable for a voltage regulator with large output capacitors beyond 1000μF, or with high switching frequency beyond 10MHz [4] that hardly delivers more than 2A current with a good efficiency. To mitigate the disturbance impact, [2] has proposed adding or dropping a phase slowly, to allow the PID control to gradually redistribute the phase currents. However, the load current may change direction spontaneously before the completion of the transition, leading to deterioration in the transient response. This paper presents a fast APC scheme which performs the transition within 1 switching cycle, and only requires 66μF capacitors to limit the voltage ripple within 10mV, an 88% ripple reduction with respect to the optimal PID-only control. The proposed APC scheme utilizes digital phase current data, which is also needed to determine the optimal phase count [1-3]. However, the A/D conversions consume 3mW, which is 28% of the total power consumption.

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility μ are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V<sub>GS</sub>-V<sub>T</sub> to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V<sub>GS</sub>-V<sub>T</sub> > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V<sub>DS</sub> > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2μA/pixel [80*80μm<sup>2</sup>] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd/m<sup>2</sup>). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2μA/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd/m<sup>2</sup>. This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even - own to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However, ΔΣ techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80μm pitch. The design and implementation of a compact integrated linedriver on foil enabling multiple alternating active signals through a single shift register is demonstrated here.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757524","","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Backplanes;Clocks;Delays;Pulse width modulation;Transistors","LED displays;brightness;calibration;colour displays;digital-analogue conversion;driver circuits;organic light emitting diodes;power consumption;pulse width modulation","AM backplane;DAC;active matrix OLED display;calibration;digital PWM-driven AMOLED display;drive transistor gate;external silicon display column driver;flex reducing static power consumption;foil resolution technology;multiple independent linedriver;multiplexing;pixel brightness;pixel current control;power-efficient display;pulse width modulation;single shift register;small-molecule OLED device;static backplane power loss;static power reduction;voltage 4 V;voltage 5 V;voltage 8.2 V","","2","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They contain a wide variety of modules such as multicore processors, memories, I/O interfaces, power management, and wireless transceivers. Each module has its own unique clock requirements to maximize the overall system performance. For example, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) saves processor power, spread spectrum clocking (SSC) reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), and rapid power cycling between idle and active states allows energy-proportional operation. A conventional analog integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL)-based clock generation unit (CGU) occupies large area, has a long lock time, and its output frequency resolution is limited by the reference clock frequency. While the digital fractional-N PLL-based CGU in [1] overcomes some of these drawbacks, it suffers from an intrinsic tradeoff between the time-to-digital converter (TDC)/fractional-divider quantization error and oscillator phase noise. As a result, it requires either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator both of which incur power penalty. Further, narrow PLL bandwidth limits SSC modulation frequency and increases lock time making it unsuitable for energy-proportional operation. Open-loop frequency generation using direct-digital synthesis (DDS) overcomes the drawbacks of closed-loop PLLs but it consumes a significant amount of power [2]. This paper presents an all-digital CGU using open-loop fractional dividers. Unlike [1], the proposed CGU, using only one integer-N PLL and a single reference clock, can provide multiple low-jitter outputs over a wide frequency range with fine frequency resolution. It also has SSC capability with programmable modulation depth and achieves instantaneous frequency switching.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757431","","Calibration;Clocks;Delays;Frequency modulation;Jitter;Phase locked loops","CMOS integrated circuits;UHF oscillators;clock and data recovery circuits;digital phase locked loops;direct digital synthesis;jitter;time-digital conversion","DDS;DFS;EMI;I-O interfaces;SSC modulation frequency;SoC;all-digital CGU;analog integer-N PLL-based clock generation unit;analog integer-N phase-loced loop-based CGU;closed-loop PLL;digital fractional-N PLL-based CGU;direct-digital synthesis;dynamic frequency scaling;electromagnetic interference;fractional-divider quantization error;frequency 20 MHz to 1000 MHz;high-resolution TDC;instantaneous frequency switching;low-noise oscillator;memories;multicore processors;open-loop fractional dividers;open-loop frequency generation;oscillator phase noise;power management;rapid power cycling;size 65 nm;spread spectrum clocking;systems-on-chips;time-to-digital converter;wireless transceivers","","0","","3","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually the focusing (beamforming) operation is performed for both TX and RX. The RX focusing is performed by an RX beamformer [1-5], which consists of delay elements and adders. Nowadays, digital beamformers (DBF) are mostly used for conventional ultrasound imaging because of high SNR. Recently, 2D ultrasound transducers have been introduced for 3D imaging. Since the 2D transducer has a huge number of transducer elements (e.g., 9216 for a 72×128 array), it cannot use DBF because of the huge number of required ADCs and wires inside the probe cable. Therefore, analog beamforming must be performed, at least at the front stage of the 2D transducer.In this work, where a 2D CMUT array is used, the maximum delay difference among transducer elements is 8μs with a maximum steering angle of 45° and a maximum focal depth of 15cm. The target sampling resolution is 6.25ns (λc / 53.3) with a carrier frequency of 3MHz. An analog-digital-hybrid architecture and a non-uniform sampling scheme are used for the RX beamformer of this work to achieve the wide dynamic range of delay time and small chip-area. The RX beamformer consists of 8 analog beamformers (ABF) followed by a single DBF, as shown in Fig. 24.8.1. An ABF performs the focusing operation for the input signals of the adjacent 8 channels to generate an analog output signal. The 8 analog output signals from the 8 ABFs are applied to the DBF. The DBF converts the 8 analog input signals into the 8 digital signals, and then performs the focusing operation on the 8 digital signals to generate a digital output signal for every focal point.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757499","","Arrays;Delays;Dynamic range;Focusing;Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging","analogue-digital conversion;array signal processing;three-dimensional displays;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducer arrays","2D CMUT array;2D ultrasound transducers;3D imaging;ABF;ADC;DBF;RX beamformer;RX focusing;TX;adders;analog beamforming;analog output signals;analog-digital-hybrid architecture;beamforming operation;delay elements;delay time dynamic range;digital beamformers;digital output signal;frequency 3 MHz;medical diagnosis;nonuniform sampling scheme;transducer elements;ultrasound imaging","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For applications requiring low phase noise - e.g., cellular, GPS and high-speed serial links - one possible approach is to bias the MEMS resonator at a higher DC voltage to reduce its motional impedance and increase signal energy [2]. Realizing high-voltage charge pumps in bulk CMOS technology is limited by the breakdown voltage of the well/substrate diodes shown in Fig. 23.8.1(a) and Fig. 23.8.1(b). This breakdown limit is even lower with technology scaling and is <;10V in a 22nm CMOS node.

This work demonstrates a charge pump design in 65nm technology with a three-fold increase in the output voltage range. Highvoltage tolerance is enabled by the proposed well-biasing arrangement and oxide isolation. The pump achieves 34V output by using three different charge pump cells that tradeoff achievable voltage range and power efficiency to achieve a peak efficiency of 38%.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0μm size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12μm-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0μm and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0μm pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to- realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0μm.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757365","","CMOS image sensors;Crosstalk;Diffusion tensor imaging;Photodiodes;Silicon;Three-dimensional displays;Transistors","CMOS image sensors;elemental semiconductors;interference suppression;isolation technology;lighting;matrix algebra;microlenses;optical crosstalk;photodiodes;silicon","3D backside illuminated pixel;BSI technology;CCM;CMOS image sensors;FSI;SNR performance;backside DTI;color correction matrix;color noise reduction;complete physical isolation;continuous pixel size shrinking;deep trench isolation;front side DTI;frontside illumination;microlens;nondiagonal elements;performance metric;photodiode;pixel technology;sensitivity;silicon crosstalk suppression;size 1.12 mum;structural obstacle;vertical transfer gate","","0","","8","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But in practice, antenna impedance variations will occur, causing VSWR mismatches that introduce an error in these voltage-based RF output power measurements. This paper presents a 5GHz WLAN PA with an on-chip true-RMS Power Detector, without any additional power loss or area overhead. The power detector is based on a magnetically coupled sense winding and takes advantage of transformer-based power combining and impedance transformation that has become common practice in nanometer CMOS RF PAs. The proposed power detector performs both an RF voltage and RF current measurement at the PA output and is therefore capable of performing a True power measurement, even under VSWR mismatches or load variations. This proposed power detector is implemented in 40nm standard CMOS and unlike earlier reported power detectors [1-4], it is integrated together with a 5GHz RF PA targeting the WLAN (IEEE 802.11a) communication standard.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757338","","Antenna measurements;CMOS integrated circuits;Detectors;Power generation;Radio frequency;Voltage measurement;Windings","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;MMIC power amplifiers;field effect MMIC;low-power electronics;microwave detectors;nanoelectronics;power combiners;transformers","IEEE 802.11a;PD;RF current measurement;RF output power correction;RF power;RF voltage measurement;VSWR mismatches;WLAN PA;WLAN communication standard;antenna impedance variations;battery-supplied devices;fixed load impedance;frequency 5 GHz;fully integrated power detectors;impedance transformation;magnetically coupled sense winding;nanometer CMOS RF PAs;power consumption;size 40 nm;transformer-based power combining;transformer-coupled true-RMS power detector;true power measurement;voltage-based RF output power measurements","","1","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the power efficiency of the conventional linear PA [1-4], an envelope tracking (ET) technique, which modulates supply voltage of a linear PA, has attracted attention. However, the published power efficiency, gain and output power are not sufficient for LTE applications [5], and its typical implementation requires an external supply modulator that is a high-speed power supply circuit [6]. Envelope elimination and restoration (EER) is an alternative supply modulation technique that can further improve the power efficiency over ET by replacing the linear PA with a switching PA driven by a phase signal [7]. However, to meet the specified low distortion, especially for LTE with a wide bandwidth baseband signal, an EER PA generally has difficulty achieving a wide bandwidth for the phase signal path, and requires a high-speed supply modulator, and highly accurate timing between envelope and phase signals. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces an envelope / phase generator based on a mixer and a timing aligner based on a delay-locked loop.

The segmented nonlinear DAC (NLDAC) structures in [1,2] require additional coarse phase information for fine amplitude decoding with a complex decoder. Moreover, the quarter-sine-wave technique incorporated into the segmented NLDACs in [1,2] degrades spectral purity due to the need of the MSB shift DAC that introduces additional offset. Another scheme in [3] reduces complexity and power consumption by replacing the digital-based phase-to-amplitude converter with an analog-based converter, resulting in limited spectral purity. Unlike previous schemes, this work presents comprehensive enhancements in all key areas of a DDFS, the pipelined phase accumulator (PACC), digital decoder, and NLDAC as shown in Fig. 21.3.1. First, the low-power PACC with multi-level momentarily activated bias (M<sup>2</sup>AB) is presented to reduce power dissipation.

To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA), the trend is towards Class-AB and Class-B PAs that exhibit better energy efficiency compared to Class-A. However, Class-AB and -B biasing brings along large amplitude-to-phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion which degrades EVM and ACPR. At the same time, PMOS transistors become attractive in nanometer CMOS as their f<sub>MAX</sub> exceeds 140GHz. This makes it possible to use both NMOS and PMOS transistors at mm-Wave frequencies. This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors. An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion. Furthermore, the complementary nature allows deep Class-AB operation, giving a high power efficiency at power back-off comparable to state-of-the-art 60GHz PA structures based on NMOS only.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757422","","CMOS integrated circuits;Current measurement;MOS devices;Nonlinear distortion;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Power measurement","MOSFET;differential amplifiers;intermodulation distortion;millimetre wave power amplifiers","16-QAM;64-QAM;ACPR;AM-PM distortion;Class-AB PA;Class-AB biasing;Class-B PA;Class-B biasing;EVM;IEEE 802.11ad;IEEE 802.15.3c;NMOS PMOS transistors;OFDM mode;OFDM systems;PAPR;amplitude-to-phase-modulation distortion;complementary push-pull PA;high-fidelity amplification;high-order modulation schemes;inverter-like architecture;millimeter-wave standards;mm-Wave frequencies;nanometer CMOS;peak-to-average ratio;phase distortion;power amplifiers;single-carrier mode;size 40 nm","","0","","8","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modal dispersion leads to optical-energy spreading over several symbol periods, drastically limiting distance and data-rate. Compared with copper channels, equalization is challenging because the channel response varies enormously from fiber to fiber and also over time [1]. These aspects, paired with the practical difficulty of implementing TX pulse shaping, increase the equalization burden at the receiver. To date, electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) consisting of an FIR filter cascaded with a nonlinear equalizer, such as DFE, enables 10Gb/s up to 300m according to the 10GBASE-LRM standard. To satisfy the demand for greater network capacity, solutions to reach 25Gb/s on a single fiber, and up to 400Gb/s aggregated throughput with space-division multiplexing on 16 fibers are being investigated [2]. At this data-rate, robust DSP-based EDCs still need high power, indicating an analog approach to signal processing to reduce power. To have market impact and economic feasibility, the interface must be flexible, accommodating a variable data-rates for compatibility with legacy channels and different standards [2].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757474","","CMOS integrated circuits;Coils;Inductors;Magnetic fields;Phase noise;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;cellular radio;magnetic fields;microwave integrated circuits;phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","PLL;VCO;cellular communications;concentric 8-shaped coils;dual-core CMOS;frequency 2.4 GHz to 5.3 GHz;inductor coil;magnetic fields;phase locked loops;phase noise;power consumption;radio IC;tank inductor;voltage-controlled oscillators","","2","","9","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the device noise from the LDO degrades the phase-noise performance. Recently published works [1-5] employ analog compensation techniques to lower supply sensitivity, and [2] incorporates a hybrid background calibration scheme for robustness.

In such applications, the RF transceiver consumes up to 90% of the total battery energy in a remote sensor node. In order to extend the operation lifetime, it is a primary design goal for such transceivers to improve the energy efficiency, expressed as power consumption/data-rate, to below 1nJ/bit. Although energy-detection or superregenerative ASK RXs [1] are very efficient, they are vulnerable to interference and this leads to a poor quality of the wireless link in a crowded 2.4GHz ISM band. On the other hand, FSK/PSK-type modulations are popular in the target applications because of their power-efficient hardware and higher immunity to interference. They are also widely adopted in many short-range wireless standards like IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth Smart. Thanks to the constant-envelope nature of FSK/PSK-type modulations, e.g., HS-OQPSK, they only modulate data on the carrier frequency or phase, so the TX hardware can be simplified, while the efficiency can be enhanced by driving the circuits into a saturated mode, e.g., PLL-based FSK TXs [2,5]. Similarly, in the RX counterpart, instead of processing the signal in the I/Q domain, it can be demodulated in the phase domain by using a phase-ADC [3]. However, such approach still requires a power-hungry high-frequency multi-phase LO generation and “2-dimensional” downconversion and filtering circuits. In the single-channel RX of [4], the VCO is part of the carrier-recovery and phase-demodulation loop. Therefore, the VCO frequency can be easily “pulled away” by an interferer, and the RX has a poor sensitivity because phase noise is deteriorated by the signal chain when input level is low.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757384","","Bluetooth;Frequency shift keying;Power demand;Sensitivity;Transceivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth;amplitude shift keying;analogue-digital conversion;body area networks;frequency shift keying;low-power electronics;phase noise;quadrature phase shift keying;radio transceivers;voltage-controlled oscillators","2D downconversion circuits;Bluetooth Smart;FSK-PSK-type modulations;HS-OQPSK;IEEE802.15.4;RF transceiver;VCO;amplitude shift keying;body area networks;energy detection;filtering circuits;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency shift keying;multiphase LO generation;phase noise;phase shift keying;phase-ADC;remote sensor node;sliding-IF phase-to-digital converter;superregenerative ASK receivers;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless link;wireless personal area networks","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a key approach for low-power, supply-voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) scaling has been widely used in SoC design. However, SRAM is the limiting factor of voltage-scaling, since all SRAM functions of read, write, and hold-stability are highly influenced by increased variations at low V<sub>DD</sub>, resulting in lower yield. In addition, the width-quantization property of FinFET device reduces the design window for transistor sizing, and increases the failure probability due to the un-optimized bitcell sizing [1]. In order to overcome the bitcell challenges to high yield, peripheral-assist techniques are required.

Therefore, the output power of a PA element can be compromised by the array size. The overall array's power-added-efficiency (PAE) is predominantly determined by the unit PA, which is the most critical performance metric to contain thermal and reliability issues, especially in highly integrated large PA arrays, since thermal density will be proportional to the increase of power density. Class-F and Class-F<sup>-1</sup> topologies are promising candidates for a high PAE at microwave and mm-Wave frequencies because on-chip high-Q passive components with a small form-factor will be readily available for a tuned load to terminate multiple harmonics appropriately [3].

When the size of the SP is large, part of it can be shaded by birds, trees and other objects resulting in partial shading conditions (PSCs). Multiple local maxima in the power-versus-voltage (P-V) curve of the SP are generated during PSCs. Based on a 10W SP measurement, ~30% of the available power of the SP can be lost if an energy harvester only operates at the lower local maximum power point during PSC. This issue was previously addressed by using the approach of module-integrated converters (MIC), which are tied to smaller modules of the SP. Since none of the previously reported integrated maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques in MIC can track the global maximum power point (GMPP) of the P-V curve, the number of MICs would have to increase significantly in a large-size tens-of-watt SP. This increases the volume, weight, and cost of the photovoltaic system.

Since timing accuracy is improving in nanoscale CMOS, techniques have been proposed representing analog information in the time or phase domain.

These transceivers use high-frequency PLLs with LC oscillators to satisfy stringent jitter requirements at increasing data rates. However, the large area of these oscillators limits the number of independent LC-based clocking sources and reduces the flexibility offered by the FPGA. A ring-based PLL occupies smaller area but produces higher jitter. With injection-locking (IL) techniques [2-3], ring-based oscillators achieve comparable performance with their LC counterparts [4-5] at frequencies below 10GHz. Moreover, addition of a PLL to an injection-locked VCO (IL-PLL) provides injection-timing calibration and frequency tracking against PVT [3,5]. Nevertheless, applying injection-locking techniques to high-speed ring oscillators in deep submicron CMOS processes, with high flicker-noise corner frequencies at tens of MHz, poses a design challenge for low-jitter operation. Shown in Fig. 2.8.1, injection locking can be modeled as a single-pole feedback system that achieves 20dB/dec of in-band noise shaping against intrinsic VCO phase noise over a wide bandwidth [6]. As a consequence, this technique suppresses the 1/f<sup>2</sup> noise of the VCO but not its 1/f<sup>3</sup> noise. Note that the conventional IL-PLL is capable of shaping the VCO in-band noise at 40dB/dec [6]; however, its noise shaping is limited by the narrow PLL bandwidth due to significant attenuation of the loop gain by injection locking. To achieve wideband 2<sup>nd</sup>-order noise shaping in 20nm ring oscillators, we present a circuit technique that applies pulse-position-modulated (PPM) injection through feedback control.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757334","","Bandwidth;Injection-locked oscillators;Jitter;Noise;Phase locked loops;Ring oscillators;Voltage-controlled oscillators","1/f noise;CMOS integrated circuits;flicker noise;injection locked oscillators;microwave oscillators;phase locked loops;phase noise;pulse position modulation;voltage-controlled oscillators","1/f<sup>2</sup> noise;FPGA;LC oscillator;VCO phase noise;deep submicron CMOS process;feedback control;frequency 2 GHz to 16 GHz;frequency tracking;high-frequency PLL;high-speed ring oscillator;high-speed transceiver;injection-locked VCO;injection-locked ring oscillator;injection-locking technique;injection-timing calibration;phase-noise-reduction technique;pulse-position-modulation;ring-based PLL;single-pole feedback system;size 20 nm;software-programmable clocking circuit","","0","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the robustness of the transition between frequency acquisition and phase locking is always a concern, particularly for the linear CDR, which has an extremely limited capture range. Many works, based mainly on the Pottbacker frequency detector (FD) [1], have been reported. In [3] the capture range of the FD is only ±2.4% at 20Gb/s with no capacitor bank in the VCO; in [4] the capture range of the FD is about ±6.4% at 2.75Gb/s, with an 8b resolution of the capacitor bank in the VCO; in [5] the capture range is ±15% at 10Gb/s, with an 11b resolution of the capacitor bank. Thus the Pottbacker FD inherently suffers from a limited capture range, requiring a dedicated FD and a stringent tradeoff between the CDR capture range and the number of VCO bands. In the presence of input jitter and phase-detector (PD) non-idealities, it is difficult to design an architecture where the resolution of the capacitor bank and the turnoff mechanism can guarantee that the VCO frequency will eventually fall within the pull-in range of the CDR.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757378","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Detectors;Jitter;Partial discharges;Solid state circuits;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;clock and data recovery circuits;phase detectors;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS;PD nonidealities;Pottbacker FD;Pottbacker frequency detector;VCO;bit rate 8.2 Gbit/s to 10.3 Gbit/s;capacitor bank;dual-loop architecture;frequency acquisition;input jitter;linear CDR;phase locking;phase-detector;pullin range;referenceless CDR architectures;size 0.18 mum;turnoff mechanism","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source). This method requires no injection of additional test signals and operates at a low rate, achieving low-noise and low-power operation, and also is suitable even for bangbang PLLs.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757335","","Bandwidth;Finite impulse response filters;IIR filters;Jitter;Modulation;Phase locked loops;Solid state circuits","digital phase locked loops;phase detectors;voltage-controlled oscillators","VCO;background calibration technique;bang-bang PLL;bang-bang phase detector;digital loop filter;digital phased-locked loop;digitally-controlled oscillator;direct frequency modulator;frequency-tuning range;mixed-signal building blocks;modulation signal;time/digital converter","","2","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the one hand, the expanding variety of transmission modes calls for highly flexible solutions supporting the ever-growing number and diversity of application requirements. On the other hand, stringent power restrictions (e.g., at femto base stations and terminals) must be considered, while satisfying the demanding performance requirements. In order to cope with these issues, existing SDR platforms, e.g. [1-2], propose an MPSoC with a heterogeneous array of processing elements (PEs). MPSoC solutions provide programmability and parallelism yielding flexibility, processing performance and power efficiency. To schedule the resources and to apply power gating, a static approach is employed. In contrast, we present a heterogeneous MPSoC platform (Tomahawk2) with runtime scheduling and fine-grained hierarchical power management. This solution can fully adapt to the dynamically varying workload and semi-deterministic behavior in modern concurrent wireless applications. The proposed dynamic scheduler (CoreManager, CM) can be implemented either in software on a general-purpose processor or on a dedicated application-specific hardware unit. It is evident that the software approach offers the highest degree of flexibility; however, it may become a performance-bottleneck for complex applications. A high-throughput ASIC was presented in [3], but this solution does not permit scheduling algorithms to be adjusted.

Since CES embeds the clock-transition information in the data stream, it enables wide-range clock acquisition with PLL-based [1,2] or DLL-based [3-5] clock-and-data recovery (CDR) schemes. It also offers additional benefits of reduced EMI and low cost by eliminating the need for an additional clock channel or reference signal. For clock recovery, however, CES transmits a significant number of extra bits attached to each data packet to carry clock transition information. The number of extra bits is at least three [4] or four [3], sufficient to reduce the effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI) on clock transitions from adjacent random data patterns, providing cleaner reference to the clock recovery circuit. The repeated transitions in every data packet also intensify the spectral energy at the clock frequency as the data-rate increases, seriously aggravating EMI problem. This paper presents a DLL-based CDR with a new CES scheme that carries clock transitions with only one bit overhead but effectively sees the same ISI as a three- or four-bit overhead. By introducing a pattern-dependent clock embedding, our CES assimilates with random data transitions and almost eliminates the EMI issue.

Numerous ToF range imager developments have been reported [1-4]. Recent developments are often based on CMOS image sensor technology with pinned photodiode options [5-7], which are suitable for cost-effective mass production. Reported CMOS ToF range imagers use single-tap or two-tap lock-in pixels; to cancel the influence of background light, two or four sub-frames are used to produce a background-canceled range image. These architectures, however, have difficulty with precise range measurements of moving objects, because background light cancelation is not guaranteed for moving objects. Lock-in pixels without any charge-draining gate suffer from background light during the readout time of the operation. Another important issue with CMOS ToF range imagers for high range resolution is the speed of lock-in pixels, which must be improved to use high-modulation-frequency light or short-duration light pulses.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757368","","CMOS image sensors;CMOS integrated circuits;Electric fields;Image resolution;Logic gates;Modulation","CMOS image sensors;photodiodes","3D mice;CMOS image sensor technology;amusement;automobiles;background light cancelation;background-canceled range image;charge-draining gate;cost-effective mass production;gesture-based remote controllers;high-modulation-frequency light pulses;in-pixel background canceling;lateral-electric-field charge modulators;lock-in pixels;moving objects range measurements;photodiode;range imager developments;robots;security systems;short-duration light pulses;time-of-flight CMOS image sensor;time-of-flight range imagers","","0","","9","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are two critical factors hindering their uptake in SoC products. One factor is that a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is highly sensitive to supply noise. A common solution is to apply voltage regulation or to adopt digital calibration [2] at the cost of larger area, higher power consumption or both. The other factor is a power-hungry time-to-digital converter (TDC), which typically requires complex auxiliary circuitry to overcome sensitivity to process, voltage and temperature [3]. A bang-bang phase/frequency detector (BBPFD) is a good alternative to the TDC for low-power small-size applications. A fractional-N implementation, however, still demands a fractional frequency divider with high design complexity [5]. This paper presents a bang-bang all-digital fractional-N PLL, which occupies a small area, consumes low power and addresses the aforementioned issues. A block diagram of the fractional-N DPLL is shown in Fig. 15.2.1. An automatic frequency controller (AFC) tunes a DCO frequency in the foreground for fast locking. The DCO employs a supply-noise canceling architecture to address the power supply noise issue with negligible power and area overhead. We adopt a phase-interpolator-based fractional divider controlled by a walking-one phase selector for low power and compactness.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757429","","Computer architecture;Frequency control;Frequency conversion;Frequency measurement;Microprocessors;Phase locked loops;Power supplies","CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital phase locked loops;frequency dividers;low-power electronics;phase detectors;time-digital conversion;voltage-controlled oscillators","AFC;BBPFD;DCO frequency;DPLLs;SoC products;TDC;advanced CMOS technology;automatic frequency controller;bang-bang digital fractional-N PLL;bang-bang phase-frequency detector;complex auxiliary circuitry;digital calibration;digital phase-locked loops;digitally controlled oscillator;high design complexity;low-power small-size applications;phase-interpolator-based fractional divider;power 3.1 mW;power consumption;power-hungry time-to-digital converter;power-supply-noise cancellation technique;voltage regulation;walking-one-phase-selection fractional frequency divider","","0","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is well known that sequential elements have a strong sensitivity to process variations in NTC [2], which can have a significant impact on system yield and power consumption. In order to achieve reliable energy-efficient operation across a wide operating voltage range, a flip-flop should have the following attributes: 1) static operation, since dynamic nodes are highly susceptible to PVT variations at low voltage; 2) contention-free transitions, since ratioed logic has poor robustness across the wide range of device I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF</sub> ratios incurred with voltage scaling; 3) single-phase clocking, which avoids toggling of internal clock inverters and the corresponding power penalty; 4) minimum or no area penalty compared to conventional flip-flops.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757516","","CMOS integrated circuits;Clocks;Delays;Energy efficiency;Flip-flops;Power measurement;Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS logic circuits;flip-flops;low-power electronics;power aware computing;sequential circuits","NTC;PVT variations;area penalty;contention-free transitions;digital integrated circuits;energy-efficient operation;low-power applications;nanometer CMOS;near-threshold computing;process variations;sequential elements;single-phase clocking;size 45 nm;static contention-free single-phase clocked flip-flop;static operation;voltage scaling;voltage-scaled systems","","0","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching. Circuit switching removes intra-route data storage, but suffers from low network utilization due to serialized channel setup and data transfer [2]. Hybrid packet/circuit switching parallelizes these operations for higher network utilization.

One of the common technologies in contactless 3D scanners is the light-section method, which has advantages in term of accuracy. The method, however, requires a long base line between a camera and light source to achieve high resolution and a mechanical scanning system. A high range resolution Time-of-Flight (ToF) imager provides new possibilities of implementing a miniature head, which allows flexible scanning of an object with a complicated structure. The range resolution of reported CMOS ToF imagers [1-3] is limited to a few centimeters. For higher resolution, higher modulation frequency is required. However, the modulation frequency used for CMOS ToF imagers is limited to several tens of MHz. This paper presents a ToF imager with 0.3mm range resolution, which corresponds to 2ps time resolution. To achieve this high resolution, the imager uses a ToF measurement technique based on an impulse photocurrent response [4] and draining-only modulation (DOM) pixels [5].

The sensors are embedded at multiple locations in a microprocessor and monitor temperatures that are used to manage the operation of the microprocessor under local and global thermal constraints. While existing sensors achieve impressive area and accuracy, emerging technology trends such as multi-core architectures, 3D integration, tri-gate devices, and low-voltage operation demand even better sensors with difficult-to-meet requirements. Those requirements are three-fold: 1) Sensors need to be area efficient. By increasing the number of cores and hot spots, there are more locations that require thermal monitoring. To reduce the overhead, the sensor footprint needs to be minimized. A compact footprint is further critical for design flexibility, as the exact sensor locations (e.g. near hot spots) are often only identified in later stages of the design process [1]. 2) Sensors need to have low calibration cost, while achieving sufficient accuracy. The requirements of <;8°C in absolute inaccuracy and <;3°C in relative inaccuracy have been outlined in [2]. 3) Finally, the sensors need better supply voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) scalability.

This challenge is even more detrimental at mm-Wave and THz frequencies where conductive loss, undesired couplings, phase/gain mismatch, and high power consumption are among many adverse effects of such lengthy connections. To address this issue, this work presents a novel scalable system for THz signal generation and radiation. Figure 14.6.1 shows the architecture consisting of a 2-D array of coupled oscillating elements. Each oscillator with its antenna forms a small THz radiator. While independently radiating, each element is also unidirectionally connected to its neighboring elements in both horizontal and vertical directions through variable phase shifters, ψrow and ψcol, respectively. This network is inherently scalable because it only relies on couplings with the nearest neighbors and there is no high-frequency global routing to any oscillator. The purpose of this topology is twofold: first to synchronize all the oscillators to a single frequency and next, to set a desired phase shift between the adjacent elements (Δφrow and Δφcol). We can show that by employing this particular coupling structure only a small subset of all the theoretical coupling modes are physically stable. By proper control of the couplings one can ensure the system settles into the desired coupling mode [1].","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757425","","Antenna measurements;Arrays;CMOS integrated circuits;Couplings;Frequency measurement;Oscillators;Phase shifters","CMOS integrated circuits;antenna phased arrays;millimetre wave antenna arrays;millimetre wave oscillators;millimetre wave phase shifters;terahertz wave generation","2D phased array;THz frequencies;THz radiator;THz signal generation;THz signal radiation;adjacent elements;array connections;bulk CMOS;coupled oscillating elements;couplings control;frequency 338 GHz;mm-Wave frequencies;oscillator;phased arrays;scalable system;size 65 nm;theoretical coupling modes;variable phase shifters","","3","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The next step is to adopt aggressive power-management schemes to further improve the DBS efficiency. Current-controlled stimulation (CCS) enables precise charge control and safe operation, but it has low power efficiency due to the dropout voltage across current sources [1,2]. Switched-capacitor stimulation (SCS), proposed in [3], takes advantage of both high efficiency and safety using capacitor banks to transfer charge to the tissue, but it requires an efficient on-chip capacitor charging system, directly from the inductive link.

As shown in Fig. 21.8.1, the pulled oscillator spectrum is no longer a single-tone sinusoid, which can drastically degrade the transmitter EVM or spectrum mask. To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption. Moreover, in many modern radios it is common to have more than one VCO on-chip (Fig. 21.8.1) to support various features such as FDD, carrier aggregation, or coexistence, further exacerbating the problem through multiple-VCO cross-coupling. To address these concerns we propose a calibration scheme that corrects any pulling effect regardless of its source or magnitude. Our approach is fully digital and is automatically calibrated, leading to a reliable and robust solution, and has little impact on power consumption, size, or transmitter noise.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757476","","Amplitude modulation;Baseband;Calibration;Frequency modulation;Phase locked loops;Transmitters;Voltage-controlled oscillators","calibration;phase locked loops;radio transmitters;voltage-controlled oscillators","PLL;VCO;automatically calibrated approach;calibration scheme;direct-conversion transmitters;fully digital approach;power consumption;pulling mitigation technique;size;transmitter noise","","1","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wearable devices can be carried by users in a most natural way and provide all-round connectivity 24-7 without the hassle of stopping all other activities, which enables a totally different mobile experience. For wearable devices, body channel communication (BCC) is an excellent alternative of conventional wireless communication through the air, to obviate the need of high-power transceivers and bulky antennas.

Moreover, the form factor is very constrained in applications such as wearable electronic devices and sensor networks. Recently, low-V<sub>IN</sub> charge pumps (CPs) for energy harvesting has been compared with DC-DC converters using a large inductor [1-3].

The CP in [2] achieves the lowest operation voltage. However, the design with a 10-stage CP provides low output power.

"4.4 A 10/30MHz Wide-duty-cycle-range buck converter with DDA-based Type-III compensator and fast reference-tracking responses for DVS applications","Lin Cheng; Yonggen Liu; Wing-Hung Ki","Hong Kong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Hong Kong, China","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2014 IEEE International","20140306","2014","","","84","85","Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is an effective strategy in reducing the power consumption of a processor through adjusting its supply voltage at runtime. The power converter that drives the processor should have a wide output voltage range and fast reference-tracking response while maintaining a high efficiency. For such applications, inductive switching converters are suitable candidates [1-4]. To enhance the transient response and to reduce the size of off-chip components, DC-DC converters switching in the 10MHz range are studied recently. When switching at a high frequency, efficiency is compromised as the switching loss becomes significant. Moreover, comparator delay of a few ns causes serious over-charging and over-discharging of the ramp capacitor and the delay also limits the maximum duty cycle of the converter. A current-mode control needs an on-chip current sensor that would consume too much power when running in the 10MHz range. In [5], a 5MHz converter employs auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control, but the duty cycle range is limited to 0.6. A higher switching frequency (f<sub>s</sub>) would further reduce this range and would not be applicable for DVS. Therefore, a voltage-mode control with Type-III compensation for loop bandwidth extension becomes an attractive solution. However, a conventional Type-III compensator needs large on-chip compensation capacitors and resistors. In [6], a pseudo Type-III compensator reduces the value and thus size of those components, however, it requires adding lowpass and bandpass functions that complicates the design, and furthermore it does not use any special technique for fast reference tracking.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757348","","Capacitors;Current measurement;Delays;Solid state circuits;Switches;System-on-chip;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;electric current control;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;reference circuits;switching convertors;transient response","DC-DC converters;DDA-based type-III compensator;DVS;buck converter;current-mode control;duty cycle;dynamic voltage scaling;frequency 10 MHz;frequency 30 MHz;inductive switching converters;loop bandwidth extension;microprocessors;on-chip current sensor;peak-current control;ramp capacitor;reference-tracking response;transient response;valley-current control;voltage-mode control","","3","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than -35dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes.

As a result, peak processor currents have reached several amperes with slew rates on the order of 1A/ns. These fast large steps incur large output voltage (V<sub>OUT</sub>) droops, which induce failed paths and cause processor black-outs. Present voltage regulators (VRs) combat these challenges by using bulky output capacitor (C<sub>OUT</sub>) arrays that could add up to over 100μF. However, this practice is untenable for next-generation APs, which have severely limited PCB area and require fast dynamic voltage scaling. These challenges have led to great demand for ultra-fast VRs. PWM control requires a bandwidth 5 to 10× less than the switching frequency, f<sub>SW</sub>, which results in a slow response [1]. Hysteretic control has been proposed to achieve faster response [2, 3], however, it still suffers from an inherent delay (t<sub>delay</sub>) up to the discharge period, (1-D)T, due to realistic hysteretic window size and inductor current (I<sub>L</sub>) slew limit. Consider, for example, a fast hysteretic VR achieving 10% voltage droop for an instant load step of 5A. For an inductor (L) chosen to have I<sub>L</sub> ripple <; 200mA, and C<sub>OUT</sub> under a few μF, t<sub>delay</sub> cannot exceed a few ns. This requires a f<sub>SW</sub> from 0.5 to 1GHz, which in turn causes a large switching loss and restricts the feasible power level of the converter. This is against the power demand trend of APs. An interleaved multiphase topology can be the most effective way to improve both the system response and the equivalent I<sub>L</sub> slew rate by changing the number of phases; however, clock and phase synchronization and current sharing for conventional hysteretic control are challenging.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757346","","Capacitors;Current measurement;Inductors;Program processors;Steady-state;Synchronization;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;capacitors;hysteresis;printed circuits;synchronisation;voltage regulators","PCB area;PWM control;VRs;application processors;bulky output capacitor arrays;clock frequency;current 5 A;current 6 A;current sharing;current-mode zero-delay synchronized hysteretic control;discharge period;fast dynamic voltage scaling;four-phase ZDS hysteretic DC-DC converter;frequency 0.5 GHz to 1 GHz;frequency 40 MHz;hysteretic window size;inductor current slew limit;interleaved multiphase topology;load transient;next-generation APs;phase synchronization;portable electronics;power dissipation;slew rates;switching loss;time 230 ns;time 5 ns;voltage 118 mV;voltage regulators","","1","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) can help achieve these goals in load circuits, though generally at the expense of increased DC-DC converter size (through use of external inductors) or loss (through linear regulation). While switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters can offer conversion in small fully integrated form factors [1-5], their efficiencies are only high at discrete ratios between the input and output voltages. To increase an SC converter efficiency across its output voltage range, multiple conversion ratios can be utilized to realize a finer output voltage resolution. For instance, many converters employ a small handful of conversion ratios [1-4]. However, more conversion ratios are generally necessary to achieve high efficiency across the wide output range necessary for DVS, as converter efficiencies can otherwise fall by more than 20% between unloaded ratios [1-4]. Unfortunately, increasing the number of ratios beyond a small handful using standard topologies can significantly increase the number of components, escalating converter complexity and adding losses in the additional switching elements. To overcome this, a successive approximation (SAR) SC topology was proposed in [6] which cascades several 2:1 SC stages to provide a large number of conversion ratios with minimal hardware overhead. However, the linear cascading of stages introduces cascaded losses, limiting overall efficiency. For example, the minimum R<sub>out</sub> is more than 30X R<sub>out</sub> of a similar ratio Series-Parallel topology using the same silicon area. Additionally, current density is limited to that of a single stage, and capacitance utilization can be low for many conversion ratios.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757350","","Capacitance;Capacitors;Current measurement;Switches;System-on-chip;Topology;Voltage measurement","DC-DC power convertors;network topology;switched capacitor networks","converter complexity;current density;dynamic voltage scaling;fully integrated 15-ratio recursive switched-capacitor DC-DC converter;multiple conversion ratios;output voltage range;series-parallel topology;successive approximation SC topology;voltage 0.1 V to 2.2 V","","2","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It also has different operating modes such as Proximity-Inductively-Coupled Card (PICC) or card-emulation mode, Proximity-Coupled-Device (PCD) or reader mode and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mode. Furthermore, some PCDs transmit NFC-A/B/F ASK data in a polling loop manner. Therefore, PICC receivers must support joint data-type detection for successful communication with such PCDs. The device shown in Fig. 9.1.1 supports all these operating modes and complies with ISO-14443, ISO-18092 and NFC Forum standards. The SoC has an ultra-low current receiver, a digital transmitter with a 250mA-maximum-current-drive Class-D PA, a Single-Wire Protocol (SWP) supporting two external UICC SIM cards and one micro-SD chip, an energy-harvesting rectifier unit, an agile synthesizer, and a digital modem. Traditionally, two separate receivers with respective synthesizers and clock recovery/generation circuits are adopted for PICC, PCD and P2P modes [1,2]. In addition, three parallel analog demodulators are needed (one each for NFC-A, B and F) to support joint data-type detection, thus increasing die area significantly. The focus of this paper is the adoption of a single receiver with one reconfigurable PLL to support all NFC modes for compact die area.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757380","","Amplitude shift keying;Clocks;Detectors;Phase locked loops;Receivers;System-on-chip","CMOS integrated circuits;amplitude shift keying;energy harvesting;near-field communication;phase locked loops;phase shift keying;radio receivers;radio transmitters;system-on-chip","ASK;BPSK;CMOS;ISO-14443;ISO-18092;NFC;PICC-PCD receiver;PLL;SoC;UICC SIM cards;agile synthesizer;bit rate 106 kbit/s to 848 kbit/s;card-emulation mode;clock recovery/generation circuits;current 250 mA;digital transmitter;energy-harvesting rectifier unit;maximum-current-drive Class-D PA;micro-SD chip;near-field communication;peer-to-peer mode;phase locked loops;proximity-coupled-device;proximity-inductively-coupled card;reader mode;single-wire protocol;size 0.11 mum;synthesizers;system-on-chip;ultra-low current receiver","","0","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This trend necessitates assist circuits for SRAM to increase the immunity against variations, and many papers in this area [1-4] have been published. In this paper, we present an assist circuit suitable for the SRAMs in 20nm generation. Figure 13.3.1 compares local variations of SRAM cell transistors, pass-gate NMOS (PG), pull-down NMOS (PD) and pull-up PMOS (PU) for 28 and 20nm, showing degradation as the process advances. Noticeably, the NMOS transistors become worse than PMOS, which causes degradation in SRAM operating margin since SRAM characteristics such as static noise margin (SNM) are more sensitive to NMOS than PMOS. Figure 13.3.1 also shows the operational window enclosed by read and write immunity against local variations in 28 and 20nm. This indicates assist circuits must perform beyond the level established in previously published work to address SRAM variation in advanced technology nodes. Lowering wordline (WL) voltage level is one of the read-assist approaches. Lowering the supply voltage of PU in a cell (ARVDD) and negative bitline (BL) techniques are known to be effective for the write operation. These techniques, however, have side-effects: lowering the WL voltage degrades write margin and lowering ARVDD leads to higher power consumption and a long cycle-time. Furthermore, the negative BL technique can cause write errors in non-selected columns. Thus, it is necessary to select which assist technique should be applied depending on each process technology. In addition, the SRAM used in production generally include single-port SRAM (SP-SRAM) and dual-port SRAM (DP-SRAM), so the assist circuits to be applied should be effective for whole SRAM family.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757414","","Degradation;Fuses;Power demand;Random access memory;Temperature measurement;Transistors;Voltage control","CMOS memory circuits;MOSFET;SRAM chips","ARVDD;DP-SRAM;NMOS transistors;SNM;SP-SRAM;SRAM cell transistors;SRAM operation margin;WL voltage level;assist circuits;degradation;dual-port SRAM;local variations;negative BL techniques;negative bitline techniques;pass-gate NMOS;process technology scaling;pull-down NMOS;pull-up PMOS;read and write immunity;read-assist approaches;single-port SRAM;size 20 nm;size 28 nm;static noise margin;transistor characteristics;wordline voltage level;write errors;write operation","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the area and power consumption are exponentially increased by increasing the resolution since the number of comparators must be 2<sup>N</sup>. A folding architecture is a well-known technique to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high sampling rate and low latency [1,2]. Folding architectures were previously realized by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers.

In contrast, a folding ADC with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers is reported in [3].

The two major challenges in the design of such a CDR are: (a) extracting the bit-rate from the incoming random data stream, and (b) designing a wide-tuning-range low-noise oscillator. Among all available frequency detectors (FDs), the stochastic divider-based approach has the widest frequency acquisition range and is well suited for sub-rate CDRs [1]. However, its accuracy strongly depends on input transition density (0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1), with any deviation of ρ from 0.5 (50% transition density) causing 2×(ρ-0.5)×10<sup>6</sup> ppm of frequency error. In this paper, we present an automatic frequency-acquisition scheme that has unlimited range and is immune to variations in transition density. Implemented using a conventional bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), it requires minimum additional hardware and is applicable to sub-rate CDRs as well. Instead of using multiple LC oscillators that are carefully designed to cover a wide frequency range [2,3], a ring-oscillator-based fractional-N PLL is used as a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to achieve both wide range and low noise, and to decouple the tradeoff between jitter transfer (JTRAN) bandwidth and ring-oscillator-noise suppression.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757377","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Frequency locked loops;Frequency measurement;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase locked loops","CMOS digital integrated circuits;circuit tuning;clock and data recovery circuits;interference suppression;jitter;oscillators;phase detectors;phase locked loops","BBPD;CMOS technology;DCO;LC oscillators;automatic frequency acquisition;bang-bang phase detector;bit rate 4 Gbit/s to 10.5 Gbit/s;clock and data recovery circuit;continuous-rate digital CDR;digitally controlled oscillator;frequency detectors;jitter transfer;low noise oscillator;ring oscillator based fractional-N PLL;ring oscillator noise suppression;single-chip multistandard solution;size 65 nm;wide tuning range","","0","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to meet new standards, such a OIF CEI-25G-LR, CEI-28G-MR/SR/VSR, IEEE802.3bj and 32G-FC, data-rates are increased to 25 to 28Gb/s, which is more than 75% higher than the previous generation of SerDes. For SerDes applications with several hundreds of lanes integrated in single chip, power consumption is very important factor while maintaining high performance. There are several previous works at 28Gb/s or higher data-rate [1-2]. They use an unrolled DFE to meet the critical timing margin, but the unrolled DFE structure increases the number of DFE slicers, increasing the overall power and die area. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce several circuits and architectural techniques. The analog front-end (AFE) uses a single-stage architecture and a compact on-chip passive inductor in the transimpedance amplifier (TIA), providing 15dB boost. The boost is adaptive and its adaptation loop is decoupled from the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) adaptation loop by the use of a group-delay adaptation (GDA) algorithm. DFE has a half-rate 1-tap unrolled structure with 2 total error latches for power and area reduction. A two-stage sense-amplifier-based slicer achieves a sensitivity of 15mV and DFE timing closure.

Unfortunately, the high IF requires high-quality-factor (Q) band-pass filters for image rejection, which cannot be easily integrated in CMOS. This forced the CMOS receivers to migrate to zero (or low) IF and suffer from the abovementioned problems. Recently, there have been attempts to revisit the high IF operation by exploiting N-path filtering [1] and a combination of a discrete-time (DT) band-pass charge-sharing filtering with feedback filtering [2].

Recently, research efforts have been made to realize bio-inspired artificial compound eyes to mimic the wide field of view (FoV) of insect visual organs by implementing photoreceptors to independently face different angles [1-2]. However, these approaches have drawbacks. They use complicated fabrication processes to form a hemispherical lens configuration and secure an independent optical path to each photoreceptor. We take a simple and practical approach to realize wide-field optic flow sensing in a pseudo-hemispherical configuration by mounting a number of 2D array optic flow sensors on a flexible PCB module as shown in Figure 7.2.1. In this scheme, the 2D optic flow sensor should meet the requirements of MAV applications: extremely low power consumption while maintaining robust optic flow generation. Conventional optic flow algorithms, such as Lucas-and-Kanade, require huge amounts of numerical calculations; therefore, they require substantial digital hardware (CPU and/or FPGA), resulting in large power consumption [3-4]. As an alternative approach for low-power implementation, bio-inspired elementary motion detector (EMD) based algorithms (or neuromorphic algorithms) have been studied and implemented in analog VLSI circuits for autonomous navigation [5-6]. However, pure analog signal processing is easily susceptible to temperature and process variations and it is difficult to scale the pixel size or apply low-power design techniques because extensive analog processing is implemented in pixel-level circuits. In this work, we have devised and implemented a time-stamp-based optic flow algorithm, which is modified from the conventional EMD algorithm to give an optimum partitioning of hardware blocks in analog and digital domains as well as assign adequate allocation of pixel-- evel, column-parallel, and chip-level processing. Temporal filtering, which may require huge hardware resources if implemented in the digital domain, remains in a pixel-level analog processing unit. Feature detection is implemented using digital circuits that are column parallel. The embedded digital core decodes the 2D time-stamp information into velocity using chip-level processing. Finally, the estimated 16b optic flow data are compressed and transmitted to the host through a 4-wired Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757366","","Biomedical optical imaging;Optical buffering;Optical device fabrication;Optical imaging;Optical reflection;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing","artificial organs;autonomous aerial vehicles;decoding;eye;image sequences","2D array optic flow sensors;4-wired serial peripheral interface bus;EMD;MAV;SPI;analog VLSI circuits;analog signal processing;autonomous navigation;bioinspired time-stamp-based 2D optic flow sensor;chip-level processing;column-parallel processing;decoding;digital circuits;elementary motion detector;feature detection;hemispherical lens configuration;insect visual organs;low power design techniques;microair vehicle;miniaturized low-power artificial compound eyes;neuromorphic algorithms;optical path;photoreceptors;pixel-level circuits;pixel-level processing;pseudohemispherical configuration;temporal filtering;wide-field optic flow sensing","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The papers presented in this session focus on increasing the level of integration of several key building blocks of wireless transceivers. The first part of the session is focused on the transmitter side and in particular on several closed-loop techniques to maximize the output power delivered to the antenna. The second part of the session gives an overview of the most recent techniques applied to the receiver path.

Piezoelectric (PE) transducers are popular energy harvesters that can be used to supply AC power at the μW to mW scale to electronic devices using ambient vibrational energy. To use PE energy effectively, the harvesting systems need a highly efficient AC-DC converter and a DC-DC converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). However, existing sub-mW converters do not include an integrated MPPT algorithm [1, 2] or use the perturb and observe MPPT method which has long tracking time [3, 4]. This long tracking time reduces the power extraction from the transducer because the maximum power point (MPP) of the input power can be changed frequently according to the environment. In this paper, a low-power harvesting system is presented that finds the MPP of the input power in one cycle of the vibration of the PE transducer.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757490","","Control systems;Detectors;Energy harvesting;Maximum power point trackers;Rectifiers;Voltage control","AC-DC power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;energy harvesting;maximum power point trackers;piezoelectric transducers;vibrations","AC-DC converter;DC-DC converter;PE energy;PE transducers;ambient vibrational energy;battery lifetime;electronic devices;implantable bio-devices;low-power harvesting system;maximum power point tracking time;mobile devices;perturb and observe MPPT method;piezoelectric transducers;power 30 muW to 10 mW;power extraction;self-powered piezoelectric energy-harvesting system;wireless sensor nodes","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"13.4 A 7ns-access-time 25μW/MHz 128kb SRAM for low-power fast wake-up MCU in 65nm CMOS with 27fA/b retention current","Fukuda, T.; Kohara, K.; Dozaka, T.; Takeyama, Y.; Midorikawa, T.; Hashimoto, K.; Wakiyama, I.; Miyano, S.; Hojo, T.","Toshiba, Kawasaki, Japan","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2014 IEEE International","20140306","2014","","","236","237","Battery lifetime is the key feature in the growing markets of sensor networks and energy-management system (EMS). Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1μA during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000× compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible - n the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds. This paper describes a 128kb SRAM with 3.5nA (27fA/b) retention current, 7ns access time, and 25μW/MHz active energy consumption. Its low retention current, high-speed, and low-power operation enable to activate SRAM in the deep-sleep mode, and also provides fast wake-up, low active energy consumption and high performance to MCU.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757415","","Batteries;Energy consumption;Leakage currents;Logic gates;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Transistors","CMOS memory circuits;SRAM chips;flash memories;leakage currents;low-power electronics","CMOS;FRAM memory cells;XLL SRAM;access-time;active current;active power;active sensing;battery lifetime;computing phase;control logic circuits;current 3.5 nA;deep sleep mode;embedded Flash memories;energy consumption;energy-management system;low-leakage current SRAM;low-power fast wake-up MCU;mode transitions;nonvolatile memory;random-access memory;retention current;sensor networks;size 65 nm;standby power;standby state;storage capacity 128 Kbit;time 7 ns","","0","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CMOS is considered a potential platform to implement a low-cost and high-yield signal generation solution at this frequency range. Despite continuous scaling, effective f<sub>max</sub> of active devices is not high enough and hence either harmonic oscillators or frequency multipliers are employed for high-frequency signal generation. In recent CMOS VCO designs, reasonable power levels (~1mW) and tuning range (~10GHz) have been reported at around 300GHz but with very low DC-to-RF efficiency (<;0.4%), which is undesirable for portable applications [1,4]. Moreover, power-level fluctuation is more than 3dB across the frequency range [1]. In this work, we introduce a scalable VCO architecture that efficiently generates and extracts the 2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic at 256GHz and hence simultaneously achieves high tuning range (16GHz), high output power (2.6mW), high DC-RF efficiency (1.14%), and low phase noise (-94dBc/Hz to -85dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset frequency across the tuning range). When compared to published state-of-the-art, this work demonstrates the highest output power, tuning range, and DC-to-RF efficiency, and the lowest phase noise among all CMOS VCOs above 200GHz.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757427","","Harmonic analysis;Logic gates;Power generation;Transistors;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;circuit tuning;field effect MIMIC;millimetre wave oscillators;voltage-controlled oscillators","2nd harmonic;CMOS VCO;DC-RF efficiency;bulk CMOS;efficiency 1.14 percent;frequency 247 GHz to 263.5 GHz;high tuning range;low phase noise;peak output power;power 2.6 mW;scalable VCO architecture;size 65 nm","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet the overall performance-scaling needs, high-speed and high-bandwidth memory is becoming increasingly important. Conventional VLSI systems often rely on on-die SRAMs to address the performance gap between CPU and main memory, DRAM. However, with the rapid growth in capacity needs for high-performance memory, SRAM is not always sufficient to meet the demands of bandwidth-intense applications. Embedded DRAM (eDRAM) has been explored as an alternative to satisfy the high-performance and density needs in memory [1-3]. In this paper, a high-performance eDRAM based on a 22nm tri-gate CMOS technology is introduced. This eDRAM technology enables the integration of an eDRAM cell into the logic technology platform [4]. The design features a well-balanced configuration to achieve both optimal array efficiency and bandwidth. By leveraging the high-performance and low-voltage tri-gate transistor at 22nm generation, the eDRAM achieves a wide range in operating voltage, from 1.1V down to 0.7V, which is essential for low-power logic applications.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757412","","Arrays;CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Random access memory;Transistors;Voltage control","CMOS memory circuits;DRAM chips;VLSI;logic design;low-power electronics","CMOS technology scaling;CPU;VLSI design;eDRAM;embedded DRAM;frequency 2 GHz;high-bandwidth memory;high-speed memory;logic technology;low-power logic;low-voltage tri-gate transistor;size 22 nm;voltage 0.7 V;voltage 1.1 V","","4","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge is achieving sensitivity at these distances when sensing the small capacitive perturbations caused by user interaction with sensing electrodes. Among capacitive-sensing approaches, self capacitance enables substantially greater distance than mutual capacitance (i.e., between electrodes), but can suffer from ghost effects during multi-touch.

Multi-level signaling such as differential PAM-4 [1] has been used to mitigate the loss of electrical channels by lowering the signal spectrum. Such an approach suffers from lower SNR tolerance as well as higher susceptibility to crosstalk and ISI as compared to differential signaling (DS). Coded differential approaches have been reported [2] to mitigate ISI. Our approach is a generalization of DS in which ternary values are transmitted on an 8-wire bus. The set of transmitted values belongs to a code consisting of 256 code-words called the 8b8w-code (8-bits-on-8-wires) [3]. The specific correlations in the code-words of the 8b8w-code eliminate transmit common-mode and simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise and allow for detection via self-referencing comparators (unlike PAM-4), which provides additional noise immunity. Compared to DS, the 8b8w-code offers twice the throughput at 50% of the line power. Compared to PAM-4, the code offers better SNR (3dB) at 38% of the line power with enhanced tolerance of ISI and lower crosstalk generation.

A standard operation procedure to VAP treatment includes a sequence of chest radiography, sputum gram stain, sputum culture, and empiric therapy, initially with antibiotics covering broad pathogens. However, collection of the gram stain and culture of lower respiratory tract specimen is usually not time-efficient (up to 5 days), delaying the initiation of therapy and unacceptable for critically ill patients. A rapid and accurate diagnosis for VAP is therefore crucial, but still unavailable. It is known that microorganisms generate complex metabolites during infection. Fast detection is feasible by examining metabolic wastes in proximal end of the expiratory device, demanding a miniaturized, battery-powered, gas-sensing device.

However, like most wideband passive-mixer-based designs, the architecture is far less tolerant of harmonic blockers, that is blockers located at or around precise integer multiples of the LO frequency. In a typical M-phase passive mixer, shown in Fig. 3.6.1a, most out-of-band blockers are heavily attenuated by large shunt capacitors at the inputs of the baseband TIAs. Harmonic blockers are an exception and do not experience this attenuation since they are downconverted inside the TIA bandwidth, are amplified along with the wanted signal, and are only rejected by the subsequent harmonic-rejection circuitry. Since TIA gain is generally large in order to maintain a low noise figure, moderate harmonic blockers will saturate the TIAs and consequently the receiver.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757341","","Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Noise;Noise figure;Prototypes;Radio frequency;Receivers","passive networks;radio receivers","M-phase passive mixer;frequency-translational noise-cancelling receiver;harmonic blockers;harmonic-rejection circuitry;low noise figure;passive-mixer-based downconversion paths;wideband passive-mixer-based designs","","2","","4","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmission range of conventional electrical interconnections is limited due to the bandwidth of electrical channels. VCSEL-based optical interconnection technologies are a promising solution for overcoming bandwidth bottlenecks in large scale computing systems [1-3]. Although it is anticipated that the next challenge for optical interconnections is to move to a serial data-rate of 40Gb/s, there are few 40Gb/s class VCSELs at present. Overdriving is a method that boosts high-frequency response to overcome the VCSEL speed limit [4,5]. To develop high-density optical interconnections, a low-power over-driving IC is a key technology. In addition, the optical modulation amplitude (OMA) must be increased to enable long-distance transmission in large scale computing systems as a data center. To achieve this large modulation amplitude, we must overcome the jitter issue caused by the intrinsic group delay of VCSELs. In this paper, we present a 40Gb/s driver IC for over-driving a 25Gb/s VCSEL using a new 2-tap pre-emphasis circuit with tunable group-delay compensation. This circuit compensates for the complex group delay of VCSELs. With this circuit, we achieve 40Gb/s low-jitter operation with 2.3dBm OMA and reduce the power consumption to as low as 312mW/ch.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757379","","Delays;High-speed optical techniques;Integrated circuits;Integrated optics;Jitter;Optical interconnections;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","amplitude modulation;driver circuits;integrated circuits;optical interconnections;optical modulation;semiconductor lasers;surface emitting lasers;timing jitter","OMA;VCSEL;bit rate 40 Gbit/s;data centers;group-delay compensation;high-density optical interconnections;high-performance computing systems;intrinsic group delay;large scale computing systems;low-jitter operation;low-power over-driving IC;modulation amplitude;optical interconnection;optical modulation amplitude;overdriving;power consumption","","3","","7","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their performance depends on ambient illumination and they generally cannot operate in sunlight. These factors have prevented widespread adoption of gesture interfaces in energy- and volume-limited environments such as tablets and smartphones. Wearable mobile devices, too small to incorporate a touchscreen more than a few fingers wide, would benefit from a small, low-power gestural interface. Gesture recognition using sound is an attractive alternative to overcome these difficulties due to the potential for chip-scale size, low power consumption, and ambient light insensitivity. Using pulse-echo time-of-flight, MEMS ultrasonic rangers work over distances of up to a meter and achieve sub-mm ranging accuracy [1,2]. Using a 2-dimensional array of transducers, objects can be localized in 3 dimensions. This paper presents an ultrasonic 3D gesture-recognition system that uses a custom transducer chip and an ASIC to sense the location of targets such as hands. The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 12.1.1. Targets are localized using pulse-echo time-of-flight methods. Each of the 10 transceiver channels interfaces with a MEMS transducer, and each includes a transmitter and a readout circuit. Echoes from off-axis targets arrive with different phase shifts for each element in the array. The off-chip digital beamformer realigns the signal phase to maximize the SNR and determine target location.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757403","","Acoustics;Arrays;Frequency measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Three-dimensional displays;Transducers","application specific integrated circuits;array signal processing;echo;gesture recognition;microsensors;ultrasonic transducers","3D ultrasonic gesture recognition;ASIC;MEMS transducer;custom transducer chip;hands;off-chip digital beamformer;phase shifts;pulse-echo time-of-flight methods;readout circuit;signal phase;system block diagram;targets location;transceiver channels;transmitter","","0","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Error-tolerant applications and systems (e.g., multimedia) allow more aggressive voltage scaling by operating below V<sub>min</sub>, which is acceptable if errors due to bitcell write/read failures do not perceptibly reduce application quality (e.g., image quality).

It is essential to prolong battery life in these applications by using an energy-efficient ADC. A successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture, mostly composed of digital circuits, can achieve low power under low supply voltages [1,2]. Power consumption can be decreased by using either an energy-efficient capacitive-DAC switching method [1] or a low-power comparator with a majority voting technique [2]. In this work, a small coarse ADC resolves the MSB bits. Then, a detect-and-skip algorithm and an aligned switching technique are used to reduce the big fine DAC switching energy. The comparator power is also decreased by utilizing a low-power comparator during coarse conversion and a low-noise comparator during fine conversion. As a result, its FoM performance is as low as 0.85fJ/conversion-step, which is about 3 times better than that of the state-of-the-art work [2].","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757397","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Energy efficiency;Energy resolution;Redundancy;Signal resolution;Switches","CMOS digital integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits);digital-analogue conversion;low-power electronics","CMOS;FoM performance;aligned switching technique;analog-to-digital converters;battery life;detect-and-skip algorithm;digital circuits;energy-efficient ADC;energy-efficient capacitive-DAC switching method;healthcare electronic devices;long-term signal condition monitoring;low supply voltages;low-noise comparator;low-power comparator;majority voting technique;power consumption;size 40 nm;subranging SAR ADC;successive-approximation register architecture;wireless sensor networks;word length 10 bit","","7","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wide-I/O memory and GDDR5 are two types of high-bandwidth memories. GDDR5 is more compatible than wide I/O for contemporary systems, such as graphics cards and game consoles. The datarate of GDDR5 has reached 7Gb/s/pin. However, the power consumption and cost have increased owing to high-performance-oriented designs, die penalties, and additional test costs. DDR4 is an alternative low-cost memory with high performance in the range of 2.4 to 3.2Gb/s/pin [1]. However it is difficult for DDR4 DRAM to raise the 3.2Gb/s/pin bin portion to lower the cost. In DRAMs, the standby power and self-refresh power are more important than the operating power because DRAMs are mainly in the standby or self-refresh mode in systems. As the operating speed increases, the data window is narrowed, and the jitter increases. Therefore, a duty-cycle corrector (DCC) is employed to increase the data window when the external clock duty cycle is distorted in GDDR5 [2]. The bang-bang jitter caused by the DCC is inevitable even if the external clock duty ratio is exactly 50%. Sometimes the DCC may distort the data window because of an internal DCC offset. This paper presents a GDDR5M (mainstream) memory for graphics cards and a small-outline dual-inline memory module (SO-DIMM). The standby power is managed by the auto-sync mode. Additionally, the architecture of GDDR5M is similar to that of DDR4, and not GDDR5. The error-adaptive DCC can remove the initial duty-cycle offset automatically and remove the bang-bang jitter when the duty cycle of the external clock is not distorted.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757502","","Clocks;Distortion measurement;Graphics;Phase locked loops;Power demand;Random access memory;Timing","DRAM chips;clock distribution networks;jitter","DDR4 DRAM;GDDR5M mainstream memory;SO-DIMM;autosync mode;bang-bang jitter;bit rate 5.0 Gbit/s;contemporary systems;data window;datarate;duty-cycle offset;error-adaptive DCC;error-adaptive duty-cycle corrector;external clock duty ratio;game consoles;graphics cards;high-bandwidth memories;high-performance systems;power 5.4 mW;power consumption;self-refresh power;small-outline dual-inline memory module;standby power;voltage 1.35 V;wide-I-O memory","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"29.1 A 5mW CT ΔΣ ADC with embedded 2<sup>nd</sup>-order active filter and VGA achieving 82dB DR in 2MHz BW","Rajan, R.; Pavan, S.","IIT Madras, Chennai, India","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2014 IEEE International","20140306","2014","","","478","479","Conventional continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) architectures do not allow independent control of the shape and bandwidth of the signal transfer function (STF), since the STF is simply a by-product of NTF synthesis. This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1<sup>st</sup>-order RC filter was used to “tame” the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1<sup>st</sup>-order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2<sup>nd</sup>-order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW=2MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18dB) and a 2<sup>nd</sup>-order Butterworth filter (4MHz cutoff), show that the out-of-band IIP3 improves by about 10dB when compared to the CTDSM with the filter placed upfront. The filtering CTDSM+VGA, which uses a single-bit quantizer and a 4-tap FIR DAC, achieves a DR of 92dB in a 2MHz BW while consuming 5mW in a 0.13μm CMOS process. The peak instantaneous DR/SNR/SNDR are 82/80.5/74.5dB. With the VGA, the DR is 92dB.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757520","","Bandwidth;Delta-sigma modulation;Feedback;Modulation","Butterworth filters;CMOS digital integrated circuits;RC circuits;analogue-digital conversion;continuous time filters;delta-sigma modulation;transfer functions","4-tap FIR DAC;CIFF DSM;CMOS process;CT ΔΣ ADC;CTDSM loop;NTF synthesis;STF;active feedback path;bandwidth 2 MHz;built-in VGA;cascade-of-integrator-feedforward summation DSM;continuous-time delta-sigma modulator architecture;cutoff frequency;embedded second-order active filter;filter upfront;filter-CTDSM cascade;first-order RC filter;inband DR;interferer attenuation;loop stabilization;out-of-band IIP3;out-of-band interferers;peak instantaneous DR-SNR-SNDR;power 5 mW;power dissipation;second-order Butterworth filter;signal transfer function;single-bit quantizer;size 0.13 mum;transition band","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deep machine learning (DML) mimics the hierarchical presentation of information in the human brain to achieve robust automated feature extraction, reducing the dimension of such data. However, the computational complexity of DML systems limits large-scale implementations in standard digital computers. Custom analog or mixed-mode signal processors have been reported to yield much higher energy efficiency than DSP [1-4], presenting the means of overcoming these limitations. However, the use of volatile digital memory in [1-3] precludes their use in intermittently-powered devices, and the required interfacing and internal A/D/A conversions add power and area overhead. Nonvolatile storage is employed in [4], but the lack of learning capability requires task-specific programming before operation, and precludes online adaptation.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757532","","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Energy efficiency;Engines;Feature extraction;Nonvolatile memory;Training","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;computational complexity;digital-analogue conversion;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;random-access storage","CMOS technology;DML;analog deep machine learning engine;computational complexity;floating-gate storage;internal A-D-A conversions;mixed mode signal processors;nonvolatile storage;robust automated feature extraction;size 0.13 mum;volatile digital memory","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aggregate bandwidth required between two processors, for example, is expected to extend into the terabit-per-second range or higher. Bandwidth is typically the bottleneck in such situations. Optical interconnect technologies have the potential to overcome bandwidth limitations for such chip-to-chip or board-to-board communication through increased channel speed and/or multiple channels. Channel speeds have reached 25 Gb/s and higher , in addition, a 24-channel transmitter and 24-channel receiver is disclosed that employs optical vias in silicon to couple the lens array. Two possible structures to implement a multichannel system are shown. A conventional multichannel architecture places the laser diode drivers (LDD) and VCSELs on the same side of the interposer. This paper describes a 12×5 two-dimensional optical I/O array for 600 Gb/s, utilizing 60 channels, each with an operating speed of 10Gb/s. The physical limitation in the number of channels is relaxed by connecting the LDDs through vias to the VCSELs placed on the opposite side of the interposer. The arrangement of the RX, in relation to the two-dimensional photo detector (PD) and TIA array, is the same as the TX. Key elements of each channel are the LDD consuming 2.17 mW/Gb/s and the TIA that consumes 0.96 mW/Gb/s while achieving an input-referred noise of 0.95 μA<sub>rms</sub>. The low power of the LDD and TIA improve the package reliability while the high sensitivity of the TIA enables the transmission via a long optical waveguide.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757372","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Integrated optics;Optical receivers;Optical sensors;Optical transmitters;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","CMOS integrated circuits;electronics packaging;optical interconnections;optical waveguides;photodetectors;semiconductor lasers;surface emitting lasers","CMOS integrated circuit;TIA array;VCSEL;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;bit rate 600 Gbit/s;chip-to-chip interconnect;laser diode driver;multichannel architecture;optical interconnect technology;optical waveguide;package reliability;size 65 nm;two dimensional optical input-output array;two dimensional photodetector","","0","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous implementations of decoders for these throughputs and levels of reconfiguration have power consumptions on the order of the rest of the baseband processing. This paper presents a fully compatible IEEE 802.11ad LDPC decoder in 28 nm ultra-thin body and BOX fully-depleted SOI (UTBB FDSOI) technology with a power consumption that is a small fraction of the total baseband power.

This paper describes a 32b DSP fabricated in 28nm UTBB FDSOI technology [1]. Body-bias-voltage (V<sub>BB</sub>) scaling from 0V up to ±2V (Pwell/Nwell) decreases the DSP core V<sub>DDMIN</sub> to 397mV and increases clock frequency by +400% at 500mV and +114% at 1.3V. In addition to technology gains, dedicated design features are included to increase frequency over the full V<sub>DD</sub> range, considering parameter variations. As depicted in Fig. 27.1.1, the 32b datapath VLIW DSP is organized around a MAC dedicated to complex arithmetic and two dedicated operators: a cordic/divider and a compare/select. Data enters the circuit through a serial interface and code is run from a 64×32b register file. It has been shown in [1] that a given operating frequency can be achieved at a lower V<sub>DD</sub> in UTBB FDSOI compared to bulk by applying a forward-body bias. An additional design step is achieved in this work by (1) increasing the frequency at low V<sub>DD</sub> thanks to a specific selection and design of standard cells with respect to power vs. performance and (2) dynamically tracking the maximum frequency to cope with variations.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757509","","Benchmark testing;Digital signal processing;Energy efficiency;Energy measurement;Frequency measurement;Monitoring;Silicon","digital signal processing chips;multiprocessing systems;silicon-on-insulator","FMAX tracking;UTBB FDSOI technology;VLIW DSP;body-bias-voltage scaling;compare/select;complex arithmetic;cordic/divider;dedicated operator;energy efficiency;forward-body bias;mobile application;signal processing complexity;size 28 nm;voltage 1.3 V;voltage 500 mV;wide-voltage-range-operation","","2","","5","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
