"Nanoelectronics for an ubiquitous information society","Daeje Chin","","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2005. Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 2005 IEEE International","20050829","2005","","","22","26 Vol. 1","Nanoelectronics will open up both new opportunities and new challenges. Already, it has been successfully used in mass production of gigabit memories, including flash and DRAM, and in field-emission displays (FED) with carbon nanotubes. The technical challenge is to deal with process and device parameter variation, while the economic challenge is to reduce the high cost of fabrication. One way to overcome these technical and economic uncertainties is to organize a tight collaboration of the device industry with system and service industries, to distribute the risk, and to maximize the total social benefit. The ""IT 839 Strategy"" of the Korean government is an example of such a program to enhance cooperation amongst service, system, and device industries, to speed up the use of nanoelectronics for the realization of a ubiquitous information society. In such a society, information technology (IT) enables everyone to enjoy daily life without being aware of IT itself. This is made possible by the ""invisible silicon"" that resides within almost everything in our society, to sense, analyze, and control us and our environment. Nanoelectronics allows the mass production of such new silicon. RFID chips and sensor networks are examples of ""invisible silicon"", which can integrate nano-electromechanical systems and RF technology, as well as low-power and multimedia SoCs. These technologies will facilitate future IT, and change our world, just as fourth-generation mobile-phone developments are leading us to the ubiquitous information society.","0193-6530","0-7803-8904-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2005.1493855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493855","","Carbon nanotubes;Costs;Displays;Environmental economics;Fabrication;Industrial economics;Mass production;Nanoelectronics;Random access memory;Silicon","DRAM chips;carbon nanotubes;field emission displays;flash memories;government policies;information technology;nanoelectronics;technological forecasting;ubiquitous computing","DRAM;Korean IT 839 Strategy;RF technology;RFID chips;carbon nanotubes;collaboration;cooperation;economic challenge;field-emission displays;flash memories;fourth-generation mobile-phone;gigabit memories;invisible silicon;low-power SoC;multimedia SoC;nano-electromechanical systems;nanoelectronics;sensor networks;technical challenge;ubiquitous information society","","2","","","","","10-10 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ISSCC. 2005 IEEE International","20050829","2005","","","3","3","Welcome to the ISSCC 2005, the foremost forum for the presentation of advances in solid-sate semiconductor circuits and systems. Paper submissions for this, the 52nd Conference, were at an all-time high of 579, a 25% increase from the 425 papers submitted last year. This year, the ISSCC program is the largest ever, with 233 technical papers presented in 31 regular sessions, with a three-paper Plenary Session to open the Conference. There are also eight Tutorials to chose from, five Special- Topic Evening Sessions, four Panel-Discussion Evening Sessions, five all-day Advanced-Circuit-Design Forums, and one allday Short Course, making this the most extensive program ever. As well, five DAC/ISSCC Student-Design-Contest winners will preside at poster presentations. The geographical distribution of the submitted technical papers illustrates the truly international character of the Conference: This year, 43% of the accepted papers are from North America, 23% from Europe, and 34% from the Far East. Of all of these, 59% are from industry, and 41% from universities. The Conference theme for 2005 is ""Entering the Nanoelectronic Integrated-Circuit Era."" With the emergence of integrated-circuits having transistor dimensions less than 100nm, integrated-circuit technology is moving from the microelectronic era into the nanoelectronic era. The indication that we have arrived at this major transition is given by the fact that this year's Conference has 55 papers covering new circuit techniques and devices that employ transistors with dimensions of 90nm or less. Digital chips with more than one billion transistors are now being realized, and novel circuit concepts using sub-100nm transistors are enabling both higher-performance and lower-power digital computation. In the analog-circuit arena, such transistor technology will lead to higher- speed analog-to-digital converters and enable new faster data-transmission rates for both wired and wireless communications. However, circuit d- sign using transistors scaled below 100nm will require innovations that enable operation under decreasing nominal power-supply voltages, below 1.0V, and that meet the challenge of increasing device-parameter variations.","0193-6530","0-7803-8904-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2005.1493848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493848","","","","","","0","","","","","10-10 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Ambient intelligence: gigascale dreams and nanoscale realities","De Man, H.","IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2005. Digest of Technical Papers. ISSCC. 2005 IEEE International","20050829","2005","","","29","35 Vol. 1","Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a vision of a world in which people will be surrounded by networks of intelligent devices that are sensitive and adaptive to their needs. This concept implies a consumer-oriented industry driven by software from the top, and enabled (and constrained) by nano-scale physics at the atomic level. ""More-Moore"" will be needed to deliver the giga-ops computation and GHz communication capabilities required for stationary and wearable devices. But AmI also creates new challenges at the architectural and physical levels. To make AmI possible, AmI devices need two-orders-of-magnitude-lower power dissipation than today's microprocessors, at one-twentieth of the cost. These requirements conflict with the embedded programmability needed for personalization and adaptation to new services. We focus on emerging techniques for bridging this gap between software-centric systems and power-efficient platform architectures for AmI devices. A second challenge is to cope with the fact that nano-scale physical phenomena are in conflict with the traditional ""nice and predictable"" digital abstractions now used for complexity management. Techniques for coping with uncertainty and signal degradation, while achieving better-than-worst-case design, are discussed. Finally, one must realize that, to facilitate AmI, ""more-than-Moore"" technology is required, for example, for the design of autonomous wireless sensor networks. Correspondingly, attention is paid to novel combinations of technologies above and around CMOS, for the design of ultra-low-power, ultra-simple sensor motes for AmI.","0193-6530","0-7803-8904-2","","10.1109/ISSCC.2005.1493857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493857","","Ambient intelligence;CMOS technology;Computer industry;Costs;Intelligent networks;Microprocessors;Physics;Power dissipation;Power system management;Wearable computers","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;intelligent networks;nanotechnology;uncertainty handling;wearable computers;wireless sensor networks","CMOS;ambient intelligence;autonomous wireless sensor networks;complexity management;embedded programmability;gigascale dreams;intelligent device networks;lower power dissipation;more-than-Moore technology;nano-scale physics;nanoscale realities;power-efficient platform architectures;sensor motes;signal degradation;software-centric systems;uncertainty","","15","","38","","","10-10 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The always-on nature of the WuRx sets a power dissipation floor for the entire system. In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dynamic sleep design, which was developed at the 65nm node (Zhang et al., 2005), is further enhanced with op-amp-based active-feedback control and on-die programmable reference-voltage generator. The new sleep design reduces the effect of PVT variation, leading to further power reduction. The modular architecture of the design also enables the 16KB-subarray to be used directly as the building block for a 6MB L2 cache in the Core<sup>TM</sup> 2 CPU (George, 2007).

ISSCC. 2002 IEEE International","20020807","2002","1","","24","27 vol.1","Information technology (IT) emerged from the 1970s based on main-frame computers. Since then, PCs and the Internet world have drastically expanded the IT industry along with rapid growth of network and communication technology. For almost all platforms, semiconductor memories have been a key enabling technology. In the PC era, DRAM density increase has been driven by rapid expansion of applications with advanced operating systems. In the future, servers will continue driving high-density DRAM requirements, and the maximum memory size of servers will be one of the key performance parameters. 512 Mb DRAM will be widely available in 2002 and 16 Gb DRAM is expected to appear within the next 10 years. Performance of semiconductor memories will be driven by graphics applications and network systems. 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be popular in 2002 and 2 Gb/s/pin in 2004 for high-end graphics applications. Random-access times in the range of 5 ns for SRAM and 20 ns for DRAM range and 1 Gb/s/pin DRAM will be available in 2002, and even faster (frequency, latency) memories will be required for high-end network systems such as OC-768-based switches and routers and beyond. Mobile platforms, especially 3 G phones and PDAs, are driving low-voltage low-power memories. Standby power of DRAM and pseudo-SRAM has been reduced drastically over the last 2 years. 1.8 V DRAM will be in volume production in 2002 and 1.0 V DRAM is expected in 2005 for longer battery life and moving-picture capability of mobile applications. The small-form-factor requirement of mobile phones and consumer applications such as PDA, and DSC will expedite various multi-chip-package solutions such as SRAM+Flash, DRAM+Flash, and SRAM+DRAM+Flash. Recent digital convergence and the rapid reduction of $/MB of mass storage flash memory increased the usage of flash memory in various mobile and consumer applications. Semiconductor memory will continue to follow Moore's Law for at least the next 10 years and will be lead by ma- s storage flash memory technology. Memory requirement of various IT platforms will continue to increase the trend of MB/system and MB/person.","","0-7803-7335-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2002.992921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992921","","Batteries;Communication industry;Flash memory;Graphics;IP networks;Information technology;Network servers;Personal communication networks;Random access memory;Semiconductor memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;application specific integrated circuits;flash memories;information technology;integrated circuit economics;integrated circuit packaging;mobile radio;technological forecasting","3 G phones;DRAM;IT users;PDA;SRAM;battery life;customization;efficiency;flash memories;memory bit cost;memory business;mobile applications;mobile phones;packaging;semiconductor memories;small-form-factor requirement","","9","1","","","","7-7 Feb. 2002","03 Feb 2002-07 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
