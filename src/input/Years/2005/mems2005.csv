In the method, a 200-μm-thick silicon wafer bonded to a Pyrex glass wafer by anodic bonding is used as an etching mask. Inductively coupled plasma generated by C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> and CHF<sub>3</sub> gases is also used. The measured etching rate showed that the necessary deep reactive ion etching conditions for a high etching rate are low gas pressure, high gas flow rate, high antenna power, and high bias power. The measured groove profile also showed that the sidewall angle of an etched groove is 80 degrees, which is slightly inclined off the vertical sidewall, and a fractional difference in width between the mask opening and etched groove can be found when C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> plasma is used. C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> plasma is therefore more suitable for precise groove fabrication. Even with a 430-μm-deep groove, a 135-μm-thick silicon mask still remained enough to fabricate a deeper groove. Consequently, our etching method using a bonded silicon mask and C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> plasma enables fabricating a deeper Pyrex glass groove.","1084-6999","0-7803-8732-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1453981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453981","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Antenna measurements;Etching;Gases;Glass;Plasma applications;Plasma measurements;Power measurement;Silicon;Wafer bonding","carbon compounds;masks;micromechanical devices;silicon;sorption;sputtered coatings;wafer bonding","135 micron;200 micron;430 micron;C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>;Si;anisotropic deep groove fabrication;anodic bonding;antenna power;bias power;bonded silicon wafer;deep reactive ion etching;dry etching method;etching mask;etching rate;gas flow rate;gas pressure;groove profile;inductively coupled plasma generation;pyrex glass;sidewall angle","","0","","8","","","30 Jan.-3 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bending stiffness difference between the imprint areas and the membranes ensures that the deformation of the stamp during the imprint process mainly takes place in the membranes, leaving the imprint structures unaffected. By this design the strong demand to the parallelism between stamp and substrate in the imprint situation is decoupled from the pressing tool and the wafer quality. The stamp consist of 1562 imprint areas (1 mm × 1 mm) containing the patterns to be replicated. The imprinted patterns are characterized with respect to the imprint depth and the polymer residual layer thickness.

In addition, the membranes may also prevent drug delivery through needles that do not pierce the skin tissue. Applying a small voltage to the microneedle chip pressed onto the skin causes an electrochemical dissolving of membranes only at the needles that penetrated the skin tissue. The gold membrane sealed microneedles where tested for two types of operational modes. Opening the membranes by means of pressure showed that a minimum pressure of 125 kPa is needed to burst open the membranes.

In the theoretical study, we present a bidirectionally oscillating flow model, where the boundary layer thickness governs the flow rectification performance of the microdiffuser. In the experimental study, we fabricate two different microdiffuser prototypes, having the neck widths of 100 μm (D100) and 300 μm (D300), respectively. The prototypes, D100 and D300, show the maximum net flow rates of 116.6 μl/min and 344.4 μl/min, respectively, for an identical piezoelectric flow actuation using the sinusoidal drive voltage of 100 V p-p at 50 Hz. The flow rates measured from D100 and D300 are approximately 47% of the theoretical values estimated from the conventional unidirectional flow model for the net boundary layer thicker than the neck width. The experimental flow rate of D300, however, decreases from 47% of the theoretical values at the flow frequencies higher than 90 Hz, at which the net boundary layer thickness is reduced to the microdiffuser neck width. It is experimentally verified that the flow rectification performance and the net flow rate of the microdiffuser tend to decrease when the boundary layer thickness is smaller than the diffuser neck width","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838551","","Bidirectional control;Biomedical measurements;Fluid flow measurement;Frequency;Laboratories;Mechanical engineering;Neck;Prototypes;Valves;Voltage","diffusion;flow simulation;fluid oscillations;microfluidics","100 V;100 micron;300 micron;50 to 90 Hz;bidirectionally oscillating dynamic flow;bidirectionally oscillating flow model;boundary layer thickness;flow rectification performance;frequency-dependent rectification performance;microdiffuser neck width;net flow rate;piezoelectric flow actuation;planar microdiffuser;sinusoidal drive voltage","","0","","14","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Split-top electrodes are used to drive the target mode and to achieve maximum electromechanical coupling while minimizing motional resistance. The devices are fabricated from SOI wafers using a 6-mask process, avoiding the need to deposit the structural silicon layer and sacrificial oxide layer. As a result, the maximum processing temperature is kept below 250°C, allowing post-CMOS compatibility. The highest measured resonant frequency is 1.14GHz at the third mode from a disk resonator of 30μm diameter.

In order to construct a functional device, the template must be positioned onto a predetermined site on a substrate to allow external connections, and the components must be properly aligned onto the template.

Such high yield requires that the bases of the template DNA be exposed so that its counterpart can interact freely, and the template be stretched to avoid folding or coiling that hampers the interaction.

While existing simulation tools allow designers to compute resonant frequencies, few tools provide estimates of the damping in these devices. This paper reports on a new tool that allows designers, for the first time, to compute anchor losses in high-frequency resonators and account for sub-surface scatterers. By exercising the tool on a family of radially driven disk resonators, we show that the anchor loss mechanism for this class of devices involves a parasitic mixed-mode bending action that pumps energy into the substrate. Further, using the tool, we predict a large variation in resonator quality depending upon film thickness. Our simulation shows that the source of this variation is a complex radial-to-bending motion interaction, which we visualize with a root-locus diagram.

A capacitive pressure sensor reads out the cavity pressure and valve seat position and provides feedback to determine when to apply the electrostatic hold voltage. Once latched, the power can be removed from the heater and, thus, the valve only requires power to transition from open to closed and consumes no static power. The thermopneumatic/electrostatic actuator combination provides high force, high speed, and low power in an 8×8mm die and is being developed for a low-power wireless gas chromatography system. The thermopneumatic actuator closes the valve in 1s at 200mW and the valve position is determined with a sensitivity of 4.3fF/Torr.

The nanomechanics-based immunoassay biosensor was proven to be repeatedly used with desorption of the pre-bound antigen-antibody by an in-situ alternative electrical field. This new approach of electric manipulation in separating the antigen out of the antibody in a buffer fluid environment was confirmed in nanomechanics-based immunoassay biosensor in which a conventional desorption is long used with high concentrated acid solution in a range of pH 2∼3. The potential benefit of the electrical means over a conventional pre-bound antigen-antibody desorption of strong acid solution is to maintain long-standing protein activity in multiple uses such that the micro biosensor is reliable and reproducible in every detection. The complete sensing history from a monolayer of biolinker, to antibody and antigen is also first demonstrated in nanomechanics-based immunoassay.","1084-6999","0-7803-8732-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1454050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1454050","","Biosensors;Electrodes;Gold;Immune system;Nanoscale devices;Nickel;Proteins;Sea surface;Silicon;Stress","biosensors;micromanipulators;nanotechnology;proteins","acid solution;alternative electrical field;antigen-antibody separation;biolinker;buffer fluid;desorption;electric manipulation;electrical manipulation;immunoassay biosensor;label-free biomolecular recognition;microbiosensor;microfabricated cantilever;nanomechanics transduction;protein activity;reusable protein biosensor","","1","","6","","","30 Jan.-3 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mechanical elements and the mirror plate consist of a 30 μm thick single crystal silicon layer. The mirror plate is suspended by a gimbal mounting and can therefore be deflected along two axes. It is shown that a special isolation technique is suitable to separate the electrical potentials on the movable elements and therefore allows to excite the two oscillations independently. The isolation technique is based on the oxidation and polysilicon filling of 1 μm wide trenches in the 30 μm thick layer of silicon. The influence of the surrounding gas on the coupling of the oscillations is examined. No significant influence is observed. The performance of the novel 2D-Micro-Scanning-Mirror is demonstrated by the generation of various Lissajous patterns by the reflected laser beam.

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating.

This way, the optical path length through the flat measurement chamber and thus the performance of the measurements are massively enhanced compared to direct (perpendicular) beam incidence. This is demonstrated by a chip-based, colorimetric glucose-assay on serum.

It is fabricated by micro-electro-discharge machining and deployed by an angioplasty balloon. Cuffs deployed within 3-mm i.d. silicone tubes demonstrate linear and symmetric responses of 3.1-4.3 μV per cm/sec over 180 cm/sec with magnetic fields of about 0.25 T. In the passive monitoring scheme, voltage from the cuff modulates a varactor that is also connected to an antenna stent (stentenna).

This result indicates energetic ions for physical sputtering and for enhancing chemical reactions are required to etch materials which produce nonvolatile reaction products.

Resonant drive also offers a versatile solution for position sense and generates the sense signal using a single drive capacitor. Resonant drive uses the fact that the voltage across the capacitor of a series LC tank can be much higher than the input signal driving the tank. The amplification is maximum at resonance and equal to the quality factor (Q). The tank circuit consists of an external inductor and the MEMS drive capacitor. Since the input signal is amplified through the tank, low voltage electronics can fully implement the drive function. As the actuator gap closes, resonance frequency of the tank decreases. This frequency shift is used for measuring the position. Resonant drive has been successfully demonstrated using torsional MEMS mirrors that require 100V for 20 deg-optical rotation. The LC tank (Q of 15) was formed by using a 390μH inductor. All drive and sense circuits were built using only 10V CMOS parts.","1084-6999","0-7803-8732-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1453887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453887","","Actuators;Capacitors;Circuits;Electrostatics;Inductors;Low voltage;Micromechanical devices;Q factor;Resonance;Signal generators","Q-factor;capacitors;inductors;low-power electronics;micromechanical devices","10 V;100 V;MEMS capacitor;MEMS drive electronics;external inductor;frequency shift;high voltage electrostatic drive;high voltage integrated circuits;low voltage electronics;position sensing;quality factor;resonance frequency;resonant drive;series LC tank;single drive capacitor;tank circuit","","2","1","6","","","30 Jan.-3 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have measured the pressure-resistance dependency of these MWNT-based micro sensors and preliminary results indicated that the MWNT sensors were capable of sensing input pressure variations. Moreover, the I-V measurements of the resulting devices revealed that the nominal resistance of the sensing elements can be adjusted by annealing the MWNTs through electrical current heating, which offers a potential method for resistance-off set calibration. Based on these experimental evidences, we propose that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a novel material for fabricating micro pressure sensors on polymer substrates - which may serve as alternative sensors for silicon based pressure sensors when bio-compatibility and low-cost applications are required.","1084-6999","0-7803-8732-5","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1453914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453914","","Biosensors;Carbon nanotubes;Chemical elements;Current measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Fabrication;Micromechanical devices;Piezoresistance;Polymers;Pressure measurement","carbon nanotubes;microsensors;polymers;pressure sensors","300 micron;AC electrophoretic manipulation;I-V measurements;MWNT-based micro sensors;PMMA-based micro pressure sensor chip;SU8 molding/hot-embossing technique;bio-compatibility applications;bulk multi-walled carbon nanotube;carbon nanotubes;electrical current heating;low-cost applications;piezoresistive sensing elements;polymer substrates;polymethylmethacrylate;pressure-resistance dependency;resistance-off set calibration","","8","","5","","","30 Jan.-3 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As 3D multiple-step structured nozzles are required for straight and high frequency ink ejection, it was formed by ICP deep-RIE employing a “multiple-step mask method” which makes troublesome stereo-photolithography unnecessary and 128 nozzles/chip were fabricated simultaneously. The required thin, 2 μm-thick pressure plates were formed by B doped etch-stop technology combined with two-step alkaline etching which enables smooth-surfaced and uniform (2.15±0.35 (3 σ)μm) pressure plates. The typical driving voltage is 26.5 V and the SEAJet head has achieved the uniform ink ejection up to a driving frequency of 18 kHz.

Microchannels were realized by bonding a glass wafer to the silicon substrate, resulting in a transparent cover for flow visualization. Phase change during the boiling process was studied under forced convection conditions, where DI water was used as the working fluid. No boiling plateau, associated with latent heat, has been observed in the boiling curves of microchannel heat sinks. Flow visualization was carried out to understand the boiling mechanism in such a system. Three phase-change modes were observed depending on the input power level. Local nucleation boiling within the microchannels occurred at low power level. At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system. At higher input power levels, a stable annular flow mode was observed, where a thin liquid film coated each channel wall until critical heat flux conditions developed with a dryout of the system","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838550","","Etching;Heat sinks;Hydraulic diameter;Microchannel;Micromachining;Microsensors;Silicon;Temperature;Visualization;Wafer bonding","boiling;channel flow;distributed sensors;forced convection;heat sinks;micromachining;microsensors;temperature sensors;two-phase flow","DI water;MEMS device;V-groove;bulk silicon etching;distributed temperature microsensor array;flow visualization;forced convection boiling;latent heat;liquid-vapour phase transformation;local heater;microchannel heat sink;surface micromachining;wafer bonding","","0","","12","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the pneumatic test result, it is confirmed that the out-of-plane motion of the microfinger depends on the thickness of the bottom diaphragm of pneumatic balloon actuators.

Finally, the silicon mold was etched away using the mixture of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid. The surface roughness of the SiC mold is 1.2 nm Ra, which is almost identical with that of the silicon mold. This suggests that this process is promising to make the SiC mold for optical uses.

Therefore, series switches provide a much better test/study vehicle for this complex problem. Some new findings are the existence of the non-zero pull-out power and its dependence on the frequency, the increase or decrease of pull-in power with the frequency depending on the device characteristic, the closure of the instability window for the air gap height and the consequent full tuning range.

The damping force is caused by viscous friction of the gas film between a moving mirror plate and the electrodes.

To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves. For that purpose, the idea of hydraulic mean depth is introduced and is applied to the Reynolds equation.

MEMS are no exception to this rule. Five-year predictions of explosive growth often turn into 20-year marathons of endurance. The adoption of new technology often requires overwhelming evidence of superiority before displacing an established technology.

The proposed chip carrier scheme is verified by fabricating and measuring a high resistivity silicon (HRS, 10 kΩ·cm) CPW on three types of carriers (conductor-back metal, lightly-doped Si, and HRS) in the frequency range 0.5 to 40 GHz. The proposed MEMS package using the lightly-doped (15 Ω·cm) Si chip carrier and the HRS shows low loss and is resonance-free since the lightly-doped Si chip carrier effectively absorbs and suppresses the resonant leakage.

Optical switching and wavelength tuning is obtainable by means of induced thermo and electro optical effects. These results indicate the feasibility of high-speed optical integrated circuits based on silicon photonic crystal structures. In addition, simulations have shown that an AFM tip can be used for tuning and damping. These results suggest a stand-alone MEMS solution to create a chip-based on-off switch or tunable filter.

To demonstrate the functionality of this platform, RNA-based detection for Dengue 2 virus has been preformed in an automatic format with less sample and reagent volumes in a shorter period thanks to lower thermal inertia of the micro systems.

LCP exhibits good dimensional stability, material flexibility, high chemical resistance, and extremely low moisture absorption, which makes it suitable for MEMS applications. The pressure sensor comprises of a cylindrical cavity formed by a sandwich of LCP substrate, LCP spacer layer with circular holes and LCP top layer. The bottom electrode and the top electrode of the capacitive pressure sensor are defined on the top surface of the LCP substrate and the bottom surface of the top LCP layer, respectively.

MEMS are very small devices in which electric as well as mechanical and fluid phenomena appear and interact. Because of their microscopic scale, strong coupling effects arise between the different physical fields, and some forces, which were negligible at macroscopic scale, have to be taken into account. In order to accurately design such micro-electro-mechanical systems, it is of primary importance to be able to handle the strong coupling between the electric and the mechanical fields. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) is used to model the electro-mechanical interactions and to perform static and transient analyses. The application example considered here is a micro-bridge consisting in a clamped-clamped beam suspended over a substrate (the lower electrode). When a voltage is applied between the beam and the substrate, electrostatic forces appear which force the beam to bend. When the applied voltage increases, the electrostatic force becomes dominant and the plates stick together. The corresponding critical voltage is called the pull-in voltage. When the dynamic behavior of the system is taken into account, it is shown that two new parameters have to be defined: the dynamic pull-in displacement and the dynamic pull-in time.","","0-7803-9062-8","","10.1109/ESIME.2005.1502828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1502828","","Couplings;Electrodes;Electrostatics;Finite element methods;Fluid dynamics;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Microscopy;Transient analysis;Voltage","electric potential;electromagnetic coupling;electromechanical effects;electrostatics;finite element analysis;micromechanical devices;superconducting microbridges","FEM;MEMS multiphysics simulation;coupled electro-mechanics simulation;critical voltage;dynamic pull-in;electric-mechanical coupling;electro-mechanical interaction;electrostatic force;finite element method;microbridge;microsystem;numerical methodology;pull-in voltage;static analysis;transient analysis","","1","","6","","","18-20 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, there are several technologies which have achieved > 100 billion cycles of operation (for switches), and very low phase noise oscillators (for oscillators). The talk will summarize the latest development in the field, show possible field of use in multi-band tele-phones, and discuss the practical aspects of this technology (packaging, cost, reliability).","","0-7695-2398-6","","10.1109/ICMENS.2005.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540845","","Communication switching;Oscillators;Phase noise;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Silicon;Switches;Switching circuits;Tunable circuits and devices;Varactors;Wireless communication","HF antennas;micromechanical resonators;power amplifiers;radiocommunication;radiofrequency oscillators;varactors","RF MEMS;antenna modules;linear switches;linear varactors;low power wireless communication;multiband telephones;phase noise oscillators;power amplifier;quadband telephone;radiofrequency micro-electro-mechanical systems;silicon resonators;tunable impedance circuits","","0","","","","","24-27 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new ""S-shape"" micromachine-based pneumatic pump using the concept of the time delay of the compressed air flow is adopted to transport a minute amount of samples/reagents and automate the diagnosis process. While compared to traditional pneumatic micropumps, the new S-shape micropumps provide a higher pumping rate, and more importantly, simplify the control system. The new micromachine-based pneumatic valves and pumps formed by PDMS membranes are designed and fabricated using MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems) technology and are integrated to form an automatic bio-sensing chip for fast diagnosis of the infectious diseases. Experimental data show that the driving frequency, the quantity of the intersections, and the length of the S-shape microchannel could affect the pumping rate. The bio-sensing chips integrated with the micro-pneumatic valves and the S-shape pumps could successfully execute ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)-based tests using less amounts of samples and reagents within a shorter time period. The development of the automatic bio-sensing chips could provide a useful tool for fast disease detection and be crucial for a micro-total-analysis system","","0-7803-9315-5","","10.1109/ROBIO.2005.246272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1708632","","Automatic control;Biomembranes;Control systems;Delay effects;Diseases;Frequency;Microfluidics;Micromechanical devices;Micropumps;Valves","microfluidics;micropumps;pneumatic actuators","MEMS;automatic diagnosis systems;biosensing chips;integrated microfluidic chips;microelectromechanical systems;micromachine-based pneumatic pump;pneumatic valves","","0","","16","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
