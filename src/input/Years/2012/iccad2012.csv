In this paper, we propose two approaches to parallelize forward and back substitution. The first approach exploits the parallelism by computing independent variables in parallel; the second approach resolves the data dependency by leveraging a node ordering produced by nested dissection. According to the requirements of TAU 2012 power grid simulation contest, a parallel power grid transient simulator is developed and tested with IBM power grid benchmarks. Results show that the second approach with the nested-dissection-based node ordering is more efficient.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386742","Power grid;forward and back substitution;transient analysis;voltage drop","Computational modeling;Design automation;Integrated circuit modeling;Matrices;Power grids;Runtime;Transient analysis","circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;iterative methods;power grids","IBM power grid benchmarks;TAU 2012 power grid simulation contest;data dependency;factorization-based direct iterative methods;nested-dissection-based node ordering;parallel forward-back substitution;parallel power grid transient simulator;preconditioned iterative methods","","0","","27","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Precise simulation of all electrical aspects of the design including the interfaces between digital and analog circuitry, coupling across power and ground planes, crosstalk, etc., across all process corners is very hard to achieve in a practical sense. The problem is expected to get worse as analog/mixed-signal/RF devices scale beyond the 45nm node and are more tightly integrated with digital systems than at present. In this context, a post-silicon validation methodology for analog/mixed-signal/RF SoCs is proposed that relies on the use of special stimulus designed to expose differences between observed DUT behavior and its predictive model. The corresponding error signature is then used to identify the likely “type” of electrical bug and its location in the design using nonlinear optimization algorithms.

Methods that predict the suboptimality well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the implications on standard cell library design are explored.

Board, package and on-die power grids deliver power to a die having both global (full-die) as well as local (intra-die) transient effects. With a simple excitation model and a detailed die/package/board model, one can come to understand the dynamic effects occurring inside the die in terms of global and local voltage droop scenarios. These effects have been confirmed by measurements on-die. However, a simple excitation model is usually not representative of the worst-case transient scenarios causing the largest voltage droop. Any chip, especially a microprocessor, contains so many potential state transitions that it is not possible to simulate or enumerate all of them. A spectral-based learning and optimization method can alleviate this problem pre-silicon, while a micro-architectural based test generation scheme can help alleviate the problem post silicon.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386744","Power grid;on-die;voltage droop","Capacitance;Capacitors;Design automation;Metals;Power grids;Power system dynamics;Resonant frequency","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging;power supply circuits;transients","die-package-board model;full die transient effect;global transient effect;intradie transient effect;local transient effect;on-die power grid effect;optimization method;spectral based learning method;state transition;voltage droop","","0","","7","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to enhance the inter-connect's performance, the NoC is often designed to include complex components and advanced features. Along with the increase in complexity and size, ensuring the functional correctness of the NoC can be particularly challenging This challenge pervades the entire verification effort, and particularly post-silicon validation, due to the lack of observability of the networks complex internal operation. We propose a post-silicon validation platform that enhances observability of network activity by periodically taking snapshots of the packets in flight. Each node's local cache is configured to store the snapshot logs in a temporary space allocated for post-silicon validation and released at deployment. Each snapshot log is periodically and locally analyzed by a software algorithm, running on the processor's core, in order to detect functional errors. If an error is detected, the snapshot logs are aggregated and additional debug data is extracted. This includes an overview of the traffic in the network at the time surrounding the manifestation of the error, as well as a partial reconstruction of the routes followed by the packets in flight. In our experiments, we found that this approach allows us to detect several types of functional errors, as well as observe over 50% of the network's traffic on average and reconstruct at least half of each of their routes through the network.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386727","","Clocks;Computer bugs;Debugging;Monitoring;Observability","multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip","CMP;NoC;debug data;functional post-silicon diagnosis;large chip multiprocessors;network complex internal operation observability;network traffic;networks-on-chip;snapshot logs;software algorithm","","0","","10","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our framework can be divided into three stages. First, the best design performance with all possible cell-types is achieved by a Minimum Clock Period Lagrangian Relaxation (Min-Clock LR) method, which extends the traditional LR approach to conquer the difficulties in discrete scenario. Min-Clock LR fully leverages the prevalent many-core systems as the main body of its workload is composed of independent tasks. Upon a timing-valid design, we solve the timing-constrained power optimization problem by min-cost network flow. Especially, we identify and address the core issues in applying network flow technique to library-based timing model. Finally, a power prune technique is developed to take advantage of the residual slacks due to the conservative network flow construction. Experiments on ISPD 2012 benchmarks show that on average we can save 13% more leakage power on designs with fast timing constraints compared to start-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, our algorithm shows a linear empirical runtime, finishing the largest benchmark with one million cells in 1.5 hours.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386613","","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitance;Delay;Logic gates;Optimization;Solid modeling","circuit CAD;electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics;optimisation;timing","IC design;conservative network flow construction;efficient algorithm;high-performance low-power design;leakage power;library-based cell-type selection;library-based timing model;many-core systems;min-clock LR;min-cost network flow;minimum clock period Lagrangian relaxation method;network flow technique;power prune technique;residual slack;time 1.5 h;timing-constrained power optimization problem;timing-valid design;traditional LR approach","","2","","33","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mask-assignment conflicts represent the biggest challenge for MP and limiting them through design rules is crucial for the adoption of MP technology. In this paper, we offer a methodology for the early evaluation and exploration of layout and MP rules intended for speeding up the rules-development cycle. Using a novel wiring-estimation method, we create layout estimates with fine-grained congestion prediction. MP-conflicts are then predicted using a machine-learning approach. In this work, we demonstrate the use of the method for double-patterning lithography in litho-etch-litho-etch process; the methodology is more general, however, and can be applied for other multiple-patterning technologies including tripe/multiple-patterning with multiple litho-etch steps, self-aligned double patterning (SADP), and directed self-assembly. Results of testing the methodology on standard-cell layouts show an 81% accuracy in DP-conflicts prediction. The methodology was then used to explore DP and layout rules and investigate their effects on DP-compatibility and layout area. The methodology allows for rules optimization; for example, pushing the minimum tip-to-side same-color spacing rule value from 1.7× to 1.5× the minimum side-to-side spacing design rule (i.e., from 110nm down to 90nm) would more than double the number of DP-compatible cells in the library.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386588","","Artificial neural networks;Estimation;Layout;Testing;Tiles;Training;Wiring","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);lithography","DP-MP lithography;SADP;design rules;double-multiple-patterning lithography;early exploration;machine-learning approach;mask-assignment;minimum side-to-side spacing design rule;minimum tip-to-side same-color spacing rule value;multiple litho-etch step process;rule optimization;rules-development cycle;self-aligned double patterning;size 20 nm;standard-cell layouts;wiring-estimation method","","0","","30","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since they consume much larger area and power than normal registers, it is imperative to minimize the total retention storage size. The current industry practice only replace all registers with single-bit retention ones, which significantly limits the design freedom and results in excessive area and power overhead. Towards this, for the first time in literature, we propose the concept of multi-bit retention register, with which only selected registers need to be replaced. It can significantly reduce the number of bits that need to be stored and thus the area and leakage power, but needs several clock cycles for mode transition. In addition, an efficient assignment algorithm is developed to minimize the total retention storage size subject to mode transition latency constraint. Experimental results show that our framework on average can reduce the leakage power in sleep mode and the retention storage area by 66.03%, compared with the single-bit retention register based design.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386628","Low power;power gating;retention register","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Flip-flops;Latches;Registers;Synchronization;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design","clock cycles;design freedom;efficient multiple-bit retention register assignment;mode transition;mode transition latency constraint;normal registers;power gated design;single-bit retention register based design","","0","","10","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Triple patterning lithography (TPL) is a natural extension of DPL to conquer the difficulties and achieve a stitch-free layout decomposition. In this paper, we study the standard cell based row-structure layout decomposition problem in TPL. Although the general TPL layout decomposition problem is NP-hard, in this paper we will show that for standard cell based TPL layout decomposition problem, it is polynomial time solvable. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem optimally and our approach has the capability to find all stitch-free decompositions. Color balancing is also considered to ensure a balanced triple patterning decomposition. To speed up the algorithm, we further propose a hierarchical algorithm for standard cell based layout, which can reduce the run time by 34.5% on average without sacrificing the optimality. We also extend our algorithm to allow stitches for complex circuit designs, and our algorithm guarantees to find optimal solutions with minimum number of stitches.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386589","","Color;Law;Layout;Lithography;Polynomials;Standards","graph colouring;integrated circuit layout;lithography","cell based row-structure layout;color balancing;next generation lithography;polynomial time algorithm;polynomial time triple patterning algorithm;size 20 nm;standard cell based layout;stitch free layout decomposition;stitch-free decomposition","","4","","11","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, one trend of embedded processors is toward larger Register Files (RFs) which further increases static power dissipation and aggravating the issue. This paper introduces an Application-guided Function-level Register file Power-gating (AFReP) that reduces static power of RFs in embedded processors. Our AFReP approach is based on a automatic analysis of register lifetime in the application binary, followed an automatic binary instrumentation for runtime RF power-gating. The instrumented code executes on a processor with ISA and micro-architecture extension for power-gating control over individual registers. Our application binary analysis/instrumentation operates at function-level granularity, automatically gating the registers that do not contribute to program outcome. Our experimental results using an AFReP-enhanced Blackfin processor demonstrate average RF static power reduction by 60% and 52% for control and DSP applications from Mibench and DSPstone suites, respectively. The added instructions for run-time power-gating increase execution time by only 1% on average.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386627","","Instruments;Pipelines;Program processors;Radio frequency;Registers;Runtime;Transistors","CMOS logic circuits;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;microprocessor chips","AFReP;CMOS;ISA;application guided function level register file power gating;automatic binary instrumentation;embedded processor;instrumented code;microarchitecture extension;power-gating control;register lifetime;runtime RF power-gating;static power reduction","","1","","23","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the first reactant minimization approach, REMIA, during sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). Given a target concentration, REMIA constructs a skewed mixing tree to guide the sample preparation process for reactant minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that REMIA can save about 31%~52% of reactant usage on average compared with three existing sample preparation methods.

However, the existing technique can only solve this NP-hard problem efficiently on small designs. In this paper, a much faster linear time approximation scheme is proposed, which can approximate the optimal voltage partitioning solution within a factor 1 + ϵ, for any 0 <; ϵ <; 1, and runs in O(n + 1/ϵ<sup>O(1)</sup>) time, where n is the number of functional units. There are multiple ingredients in such a surprisingly low time complexity algorithm. It first categorizes all the functional units into big functional units and small functional units using an ϵ related threshold. Subsequently, a rounding based dynamic programming procedure is performed to handle big functional units and a linear programming based algorithm is performed to handle small functional units, which is followed by the discretization of the continuous linear programming solution. Moreover, through the exploration of the unique nature of our problem, a greedy algorithm is proposed to optimally solve the linear programming formulation in a combinatorial fashion. Further, since patching a salient partitioning solution of big functional units with that of small functional units could lead to a much worse combined solution, a highly efficient enumeration process running in time independent of n is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm runs very fast. It needs only 0.3 second to partition a testcase with 5000 functional units which is more than 10000 X faster than the existing algorithm while still reducing the peak power by 7.4%.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386750","Energy Efficiency;Linear Time Approximation Scheme;Peak Power;Voltage Partitioning","Approximation methods;Capacitance;Dynamic programming;Greedy algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Linear programming;Partitioning algorithms","VLSI;circuit complexity;dynamic programming;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit design;linear programming","NP-hard problem;combinatorial fashion;continuous linear programming solution;energy reduction;functional units/blocks;greedy algorithm;linear time approximation scheme;optimal voltage partitioning solution;peak power driven voltage partitioning;peak power minimization;rounding based dynamic programming procedure;salient partitioning solution;time complexity algorithm;voltage island shutdown impact","","0","","9","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Together with lengthy set up and test times for certain measurements, these cause amortized test cost to comprise a high percentage of the total cost of manufacturing semiconductor devices. In this work, we investigate a spatial correlation modeling approach using Gaussian process models to enable extrapolation of performances via sparse sampling of probe test data. The proposed method performs an order of magnitude better than existing spatial sampling methods, while requiring an order of magnitude less time to construct the prediction models. The proposed methodology is validated on manufacturing data using 57 probe test measurements across more than 3,000 wafers. By explicitly applying probe tests to only 1% of the die on each wafer, we are able to predict probe test outcomes for the remaining die within 2% of their true values.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386584","","Data models;Gaussian processes;Kernel;Probes;Radio frequency;Semiconductor device measurement;Semiconductor device modeling","Gaussian processes;automatic test equipment;correlation methods;cost reduction;extrapolation;probes;semiconductor device manufacture;semiconductor device measurement;semiconductor device testing;semiconductor industry","Gaussian process model;RF device;automated test equipment;extrapolation;parametic measurement collection;probe test cost reduction;semiconductor manufacturing industry;sparse spatial sampling method;spatial correlation modeling approach","","2","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ROMC takes advantage of the (partial) redundancy inherent in digital signals. It prioritizes input signals based on their observability at the outputs, and combines inputs based on a compatibility property that enables them to share samples.

For sparse symmetric systems arising from large power grid analysis problems, however, preconditioners generated by traditional incomplete Cholesky factorizations are usually of low quality, resulting in slow convergence. On the other hand, although preconditioners generated by random walks are quite effective to reduce the number of iterations, it takes considerable amount of time to compute them in a stochastic manner. In this paper, we propose a new preconditioning technique for power grid analysis, named deterministic random walk, that combines the advantages of the above two approaches. Our proposed algorithm computes the preconditioners in a deterministic manner to reduce computation time, while achieving similar quality as stochastic random walk preconditioning by modifying fill-ins to compensate dropped entries. We have proved that for such compensation scheme, our algorithm will not fail for certain matrix orderings, which otherwise cannot be guaranteed by traditional incomplete factorizations. We demonstrate that by incorporating our proposed preconditioner, a conjugate gradient solver is able to outperform a state-of-the-art algebraic multigrid preconditioned solver on public IBM power grid benchmarks for DC power grid analysis, while potentially remaining very efficient for transient analysis.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386642","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Monte Carlo methods;Power grids;Stochastic processes;Symmetric matrices;Vectors","iterative methods;matrix decomposition;power grids","Cholesky factorizations;deterministic random walk preconditioning;high quality pre-conditioners;iterative linear equation solvers;matrix orderings;power grid analysis;preconditioners;preconditioning technique;sparse symmetric systems;stochastic random walk preconditioning;transient analysis","","0","","39","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In most previous works, the routing resources over the IP blocks were simply treated as routing blockages, resulting in significant waste of routing resources on higher metal layers not utilized by internal intra-block routing. On the other hand, routing over large IP blocks needs special attention as there is no way to insert buffers inside hard IP blocks, which can lead to unresolvable slew/timing violations. In this paper, we propose a novel BOB-RSMT algorithm which helps reclaim the “wasted” over-the-block routing resources while meeting user-specified slew constraints. Our algorithm incrementally and efficiently migrates initial tree structures with buffering-awareness to meet slew constraints while minimizing wire length. It can handle complex blocks including rectilinear shapes. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate very promising results. By utilizing over-the-block routing resources intelligently, we can save the outside-block wire length as well as the total wire length significantly compared with the conventional obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (OA-RSMT) algorithms. BOB-RSMT also reduces the repeater count/area needed to satisfy slew constraints, which is very important for modern design closure.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386600","","Capacitance;IP networks;Merging;Optimization;Routing;Timing;Wires","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","BOB-RSMT;OA-RSMT algorithms;buffering-aware over-the-block rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction;buffering-awareness;metal layers;obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree algorithms;over-the-IP-block routing resources;rectilinear shapes;slew constraints;unresolvable slew-timing violations;user-specified slew constraints;wasted over-the-block routing resources","","0","","21","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, programming STT-RAM is a stochastic process due to the random thermal fluctuations. Conventional worst-case (corner) design with a fixed write pulse period cannot completely eliminate the write failures but maintain it at a low level by paying high cost in hardware complexity and system performance. In this work, we systematically study the impacts of the stochastic switching of STT-RAM on circuit and cache performance. Two probabilistic design techniques, write-verify-rewrite with adaptive period (WRAP) and verify-one-while-writing (VOW), then are proposed for performance improvement and write failure reduction. Our simulation results show that compared to the result of the conventional design using Hamming Code to correct the write failures, WRAP is write error free while reducing the cache write latency and energy consumption by 40% and 26%, respectively. When an extremely low write failure rate (i.e., 10<sup>-22</sup>) is allowed, VOW can further boost the reductions on write latency and energy to 52% and 29%, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid STT-RAM based cache hierarchy taking advantages of probabilistic design techniques is proposed. The novel hierarchy can reduce the write failure rate of STT-RAM cache to 10<sup>-30</sup>, while improving the speed by 6.8% and saving 15% of energy consumption compared to a conventional design with Hamming Code.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386593","","Error analysis;Hamming weight;Optimized production technology;Random access memory;Switches;Temperature sensors;Writing","cache storage;circuit stability;probability;random processes;random-access storage;stochastic processes","STT-RAM cache;VOW;WRAP;cache capacity enhancement;energy consumption;fixed write pulse period;hardware complexity;leakage power consumption minimization;lower level on-chip cache;probabilistic design methodology;random thermal fluctuation;run-time stability;spin-transfer torque random access memory;stochastic process;verify-one-while-writing;write failure reduction;write-verify-rewrite with adaptive period","","0","","19","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a new preconditioned iterative method for fast DC and transient simulation of large-scale power grids found in contemporary nanometer-scale ICs. The emphasis is placed on the preconditioner which reduces the number of iterations by a factor of 5X for a 2.6M-node industrial design and by 72.6X for a 6.2M-node synthetic benchmark, compared with incomplete factorization preconditioners. Moreover, owing to the preconditioner's special structure that allows utilizing a Fast Transform solver, the preconditioning system can be solved in a near-optimal number of operations, while it is extremely amenable to parallel computation on massively parallel architectures like graphics processing units (GPUs). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a speed-up of 214.3X and 138.7X for a 2.6M-node industrial design, and a speed-up of 1610.5X and 438X for a 3.1M-node synthetic design, over state-of-the-art direct and iterative solvers respectively when GPUs are utilized.

However, the functions that can be computed in this way are quite limited. For example, high order polynomials and non-polynomial functions cannot be computed using prior approaches. This paper proposes a new finite-state machine (FSM) topology for complex arithmetic computation on stochastic bit streams.

For 3D ICs, higher current density/temperature and TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress further exacerbate the EM issue compared to 2D ICs. In this paper, we analyze the root causes of EM for 3D IC signal nets, with consideration of current density, temperature, and TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress. We develop compact EM models for both DC and AC signal nets using detailed finite-element-analysis (FEA) and build EM library for mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). For AC signal nets, we convert AC current into equivalent DC current and model EM with it. One unique property of EM in 3D ICs is that, depending on the current direction, TSV-induced stress may degrade or improve the MTTF, thus routing plays an important role for EM mitigation. We suggest EM-aware routing algorithms for 3D ICs for the first time to our best knowledge, guided by our stress-aware EM modeling.

However, most researches on 3D-stacked DRAM have focused on increasing the memory bandwidth to improve the overall throughput of a system, even though the memory access requirements of real-world applications are various just as the computational requirements. To tackle this problem, we propose an asymmetric 3D-stacked DRAM architecture where the DRAM die is divided into multiple segments and the segments are optimized for different memory requirements. Also, since the optimal architecture of the DRAM can be different for different heterogeneous CMPs, we propose an automatic synthesis method for the asymmetric 3D-stacked DRAM architecture.

We present an automatic test pattern generation algorithm which considers waveforms and their propagation on each relevant line of the circuit. The model incorporates individual delays for each gate and filtering of small glitches. The algorithm is based on an optimized encoding of the test generation problem by a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) instance and is implemented in the tool WaveSAT. Experimental results for ISCAS-85, ITC-99 and industrial circuits show that no known definition of path sensitization can eliminate false positives and false negatives at the same time, thus resulting in inadequate small-delay fault detection. WaveSAT generates a test if the fault is testable and is also capable of automatically generating a formal redundancy proof for undetectable small-delay faults; to the best of our knowledge this is the first such algorithm that is both scalable and complete.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386585","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Delay;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Robustness","automatic test pattern generation;fault diagnosis;waveform analysis","Boolean satisfiability instance;ISCAS-85;automatic test pattern generation algorithm;detectable fault;individual delay;industrial circuit;optimized encoding;path sensitization;small-delay fault detection;small-delay-fault ATPG;tool WaveSAT;waveform accuracy","","3","","26","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, Gate Level Information Flow Tracking (GLIFT) has been proposed to monitor information flows at the level of Boolean logic. At this level, all flows are explicit which makes it possible to detect security violations, even those that occur due to difficult to detect timing channels. In this paper, we show that the encoding technique used in previous GLIFT generation methods includes redundant encoding states, which leads to large overheads in area, delay and verification time. We present a new encoding technique with fewer encoding states by leveraging an inherent property of GLIFT. By denoting don't-care input conditions to logic synthesis tools, smaller GLIFT logic for dynamic information flow tracking is obtained and shorter simulation time for static information flow security verification is achieved.

There are usually multi-million nodes on a power grid. Analyzing these huge power grids has become very expensive in terms of both time and memory. This paper presents an efficient parallel implementation of the Additive Schwarz Method (ASM) for IR-drop analysis of large-scale power grid. Based on distributed memory system, a new data storage method is proposed to overcome memory bottleneck of traditional methods. Techniques including overlapping in multiple layer and irregular power grid, via detection and grouping are utilized to accelerate the simulation. Moreover, a new communication strategy exhibiting minimum communication overhead is proposed. The proposed method is very accurate in the final solution, with the maximum error less than 0.1mv. Experimental results on industrial medium size benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves more than 110X speedup over a state-of-the-art direct LU solver. The proposed approach can easily solve very large-scale benchmarks, while LU solver fails to obtain the solution because of system memory limitation.

In this paper, we develop a compact switching model for magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ), which is the data storage device in STT-RAM cells. By leveraging the capability to simulate the impacts of thermal and process variations on MTJ switching, our model is able to analyze the diverse mechanisms of STT-RAM write operation failures. Besides the impacts of thermal and process variation, the soft error induced by radiation striking on the access transistor is another important threat to the MTJ reliability. It can also be analyzed by using our model. The incurred computation cost of our model is much less than the conventional macro-magnetic model, and hence, enabling its applications in comprehensive STT-RAM reliability analysis and design optimizations.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386753","MTJ;soft error;switching model;variation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Fluctuations;Magnetic tunneling;Magnetization;Resistance;Switches","integrated circuit reliability;magnetic tunnelling;optimisation;radiation hardening (electronics);random-access storage","MTJ reliability;MTJ switching model;access transistor;compact switching model;data storage device;embedded memory applications;environmental disturbances;magnetic tunneling junction;nanosecond access time;nonvolatility;optimizations;process variation aware;small cell size;soft error analysis;spin-transfer torque random access memory;thermal variation aware","","1","","20","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a completely scalable hybrid verification and debug system based on dynamically reconfigurable co-simulation. Unlike existing systems, it allows one or more component logic blocks of a SoC to run on simulator for debugging while rest of the design still runs on emulator. The full design under test (DUT) is run on emulator at near hardware speed for long test sequences, and on error detection one or more logic blocks are transparently switched over to simulation for debugging, initializing the system as a piecewise co-simulator. Logic blocks can be flexibly relocated between simulator and emulator dynamically, without going through time consuming design recompilation phase, allowing designers to quickly debug functional issues.

In modern VLSI designs, obstacles usually block the device layer and a fraction of metal layers. Therefore, routing wires on top of obstacles is possible. However, if a long wire is routed over an obstacle, there will be signal integrity problems because buffers cannot be placed on top of any obstacle. To tackle this problem, we impose slew constraints on the interconnects that are routed over an obstacle. This is called the obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum trees (OARSMT) problem with slew constraints over obstacles. In this paper, we first analyze an optimal solution to this problem and show that the tree structures over obstacles with slew constraints will follow some very simple forms. Based on this observation, we propose an algorithm to find an optimal solution embedded in the extended Hanan grid [1]. The solutions can guarantee the interconnect performance and avoid post-routing electrical fixups due to slew violations. We also show that our algorithm achieves over 800 times speedup and is able reduce nearly 5% routing resources on average in comparison with the state-of-the-art optimal OARSMT algorithm.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386601","","Capacitance;Delay;Joining processes;Routing;Steiner trees;Wires","VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;trees (mathematics)","OARSMT problem;device layer block;extended Hanan grid;interconnect performance;metal layer fraction;modern VLSI designs;obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum trees;optimal solution;routing wires;signal integrity problems;slew constraints;tree structures","","0","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moore's law predicted the sustained scaling the semiconductor industry has enjoyed for decades, but in the coming decade the limits of physics will force the pace of geometric scaling to slow and perhaps all but stop. In the face of this issue, the electronics industry needs alternatives that can give end consumers the continual increase in function and reduction in cost that they have come to expect. 3D integrated circuits have emerged as the near term solution to mitigate the roll-off of geometric semiconductor scaling. The power of 3D circuit integration comes from its ability to reduce wire length. The ramifications of this are more numerous and powerful than one might initially realize. The shortened wires improve speed and reduce power, but they also allow new combinations of technologies optimized for the performance of specific circuitry. 3D wiring changes alone might provide a 5-30% device improvement, but combining disparate circuit types and using 3D optimized architectures could enable 100-500% improvements. This paper discusses the benefits of 3D and the methods of producing various types of 3D and examines various examples ranging from imagers to exascale computing memories.

For 2012, the contest is focused on dynamic analysis and parallel implementation. In this paper, the organizers review the TAU 2012 Power Grid Simulation Contest. This contest was held to seek new efficient methods with parallel implementation for performing dynamic (i.e. time domain) analysis for large power grid networks.

Numerous algorithms in this area have been proposed and implemented over the last 50 years. This paper presents a ""lazy” approach to logic synthesis based on the following observations: (a) optimal or near-optimal circuits for many practical functions are already derived by the tools, making it unnecessary to implement new algorithms or even run the old ones repeatedly; (b) larger circuits are composed of smaller ones, which are often isomorphic up to a permutation/negation of inputs/outputs. Experiments confirm these observations. Moreover, a case-study shows that logic level minimization using lazy man's synthesis improves delay after LUT mapping into 4- and 6-input LUTs, compared to earlier work on high-effort delay optimization.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386733","","Benchmark testing;Boolean functions;Delay;Least squares approximation;Libraries;Optimization;Table lookup","Boolean functions;minimisation;multivalued logic circuits","Boolean function;LUT mapping;high-effort delay optimization;input negation;input permutation;lazy man logic synthesis;logic level minimization;multilevel logic circuit;multilevel logic synthesis;near-optimal circuits;optimal circuits;output negation;output permutation","","5","","31","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This phase is challenged by poor observability, limited off-chip bandwidth, and complex, concurrent communication interfaces. Furthermore, pre-silicon verification and post-silicon validation methodologies are very different and share little information between them. As as result, the diagnosis and debugging of postsilicon failures is very much an ad-hoc and time-consuming task that is largely unable to leverage the vast body of design knowledge available in pre-silicon. We propose BiPeD, a novel methodology to identify the exact time and location of post-silicon bugs. During pre-silicon verification, BiPeD learns the correct behavior of a design's communication patterns. In post-silicon, this knowledge is used to detect errors by means of a reconfigurable hardware unit. When an error is detected, bug reproduction is not necessary: a diagnosis software algorithm analyzes information stored in the hardware unit to provide a wide range of debugging information. We show that our system provides accurate bug localization for a range of failures on the industrial-size OpenSPARC T2 design.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386594","","Computer bugs;Databases;Debugging;Detectors;Hardware;Monitoring;Protocols","computer debugging;elemental semiconductors;failure analysis;microprocessor chips;reconfigurable architectures;silicon","BiPeD;Si;ad-hoc task;bug localization;communication patterns;complex communication interfaces;concurrent communication interfaces;diagnosis software algorithm;industrial-size OpenSPARC T2 design;limited off-chip bandwidth;modern chips;poor observability;post-silicon debugging;post-silicon validation;postsilicon failure diagnosis;pre-silicon debugging;reconfigurable hardware unit;time-consuming task;verification effort","","0","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has become a major reliability concern especially when technology further scales to 45 nm and below. It is thus necessary to design on-chip structures that can provide accurate aging evaluation with no performance penalty. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to accurately evaluate aging in the field. Representative Critical Reliability Paths (RCRP-s) are synthesized as a stand-alone circuit to represent the aging of critical reliability paths, which are defined as paths that can potentially become critical at some point in time due to aging. By monitoring the RCRPs, aging of the critical reliability paths can be efficiently and accurately evaluated with no impact on the normal operation of the chip. The aging evaluation results can then be exploited to guide on-chip performance calibration to ensure lifetime reliability. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed structure.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386755","Circuit aging;On-chip measurement;Path delay measurement;Representative path","Aging;Benchmark testing;Delay;Estimation;Integrated circuit reliability;Temperature measurement","VLSI;ageing;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing","circuit performance;functional failure;lifetime reliability;on-chip aging evaluation;on-chip performance calibration;on-chip structures;reliability concern;representative critical reliability paths;stand-alone circuit;transistor aging","","1","","18","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these built-in global router and state-of-the-art academic global routers use maze routing to seek a detoured path. Although very effective, maze routing is relatively slower than other routing algorithms, such as pattern routing and monotonic routing algorithms. This work presents two efficient routing algorithms, called unilateral monotonic routing and hybrid unilateral monotonic routing, to replace maze routing and to realize a highly fast maze-free global router that is suited to act as a built-in routing congestion estimator for placers.

Data partitioning is an important technique for increasing memory bandwidth by scheduling multiple simultaneous memory accesses to different memory banks. In this paper we present a vertical memory partitioning and scheduling algorithm that can generate a valid partition scheme for arbitrary affine memory inputs. It does this by arranging non-conflicting memory accesses across the border of loop iterations. A mixed memory partitioning and scheduling algorithm is also proposed to combine the advantages of the vertical and other state-of-art algorithms. A set of theorems is provided as criteria for selecting a valid partitioning scheme. This is followed by an optimal and scalable memory scheduling algorithm. By utilizing the property of constant strides between memory addresses in successive loop iterations, an address translation optimization technique for an arbitrary partition factor is proposed to improve performance, area and energy efficiency. Experimental results show that on a set of real-world medical image processing kernels, the proposed mixed algorithm with address translation optimization can gain speed-up, area reduction and power savings of 15.8%, 36% and 32.4% respectively, compared to the state-of-art memory partitioning algorithm.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386711","Behavioral Synthesis;Memory Partitioning;Memory S ch eduling","Arrays;Kernel;Memory management;Partitioning algorithms;Schedules;Scheduling algorithms","iterative methods;parallel memories;parallel processing;processor scheduling;storage allocation","address translation optimization technique;affine memory inputs;arbitrary partition factor;area improvement;area reduction;behavioral synthesis;constant stride property;data partitioning;energy efficiency improvement;loop iterations;medical image processing kernels;memory access scheduling;memory address translation optimization;memory bandwidth;memory banks;mixed memory partitioning-and-scheduling algorithm;nonconflicting memory accesses;optimal throughput;optimal-and-scalable memory scheduling algorithm;performance improvement;power savings;speed-up;vertical memory partitioning-and-scheduling algorithm cooptimization","","0","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate the problem arising from the feature scale difference between stacked dies as well as package and PCB, the 3D system is divided into many subdomains. Each subdomain (die, package or PCB) can be meshed independently using different gridding based on its feature size and therefore the required meshing cells are greatly reduced compared to conventional method such as finite element or finite volume method. The heat flow continuity between subdomains is captured using the introduced interface basis functions. In addition, the proposed compact micro-fluidic model based on finite volume method is proved to be compatible with the finite element model for solid medium based on introduced forced convection boundary and energy conservation.

Such slow response does not allow for fine control over temperature, nor does it allow frequent migration which is necessary in certain systems. In this paper, we propose Thor, an approach which is a fine-grained reliable PM scheme, for Embedded MPSoCs, to overcome the limitations of existing PM approaches. Our approach leverages custom instructions to integrate a base processor architecture, with PM functionality. We have proposed three schemes, Thor-BM (migration at basic block boundaries), Thor-BM/CR (migration at basic block boundaries with checkpoint and recovery), and ThorIM/CR (migration at instruction level with checkpoint and recovery). Our experiments show that the execution time overhead is less than 2%, while the additional area cost and power consumption costs are approximately 50% (excluding main memories, which if taken into account would substantially decrease this overhead).

Conventional digital implementations of numerical integration using binary radix encoding are costly in terms of hardware and have long computational delay. This work proposes a novel method for performing numerical integration based on the paradigm of logical computation on stochastic bit streams. In this paradigm, ordinary digital circuits are employed but they operate on stochastic bit streams instead of deterministic values; the signal value is encoded by the probability of obtaining a one versus a zero in the streams. With this type of computation, complex arithmetic operations can be implemented with very simple circuitry. However, typically, such stochastic implementations have long computational delay, since long bit streams are required to encode precise values. This paper proposes a stochastic design for numerical integration characterized by both small area and short delay - so, in contrast to previous applications, a win on both metrics. The design is based on mathematical analysis that demonstrates that the summation of a large number of terms in the numerical integration could lead to a significant delay reduction. An architecture is proposed for this task. Experiments confirm that the stochastic implementation has smaller area and shorter delay than conventional implementations.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386603","","Adders;Clocks;Delay;Encoding;Logic gates;Radiation detectors;Random variables","adders;binary codes;delays;integration;mathematical analysis;probability;stochastic processes","adder;binary radix encoding;computational delay;definite integral;delay reduction;logical computation;mathematical analysis;numerical integration;ordinary digital circuits;probability;stochastic bit streams;stochastic design","","1","","12","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Node criticalities are usually computed using the complementary path delay. In order to speed up computations, it has been recently proposed that the circuit delay be used instead. In this paper, we show that there is a monotonic relationship between the node criticalities computed using the circuit delay and the complementary delay. They are not equal, but they can be used interchangeably. We discuss the sources of error in this computation and propose methods for more accurate computations. We also introduce a measure that is very easy to compute and is an approximate indicator of criticality. Since it is easy to compute, it can also be used effectively for pruning the number of edges involved in criticality computations thus improving the speed of criticality computations.

In this paper, we present power delivery system models that are able to achieve less than 10% deviation from the supply noise measurements on a 32nm industrial microprocessor design. Our models are able to capture the unique impacts of on-die inductance, state dependent coupling capacitance and die-package interaction. Those impacts happen to be prominent for the designs in 32nm or below but were considered negligible or even not noted in earlier technology nodes. Comparisons were made to quantify the impacts of different modeling strategies on supply noise prediction accuracy. This specifically provides designers insights in selecting appropriate models for power delivery analysis. The impact of power delivery noise on timing margin was accurately estimated showing a good agreement to the worst-case jitter measurements.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386618","Power grid;capacitance;inductance;jitter;simulation","Capacitance;Couplings;Inductance;Metals;Noise;Noise measurement;Power supplies","elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;microprocessor chips;silicon","Si;die-package interaction;industrial microprocessor design;microprocessor power delivery modeling;on-die inductance;post-silicon data;power delivery analysis;power delivery optimization;power delivery simulation;power delivery system models;power integrity;silicon-validated methodology;size 32 nm;state dependent coupling capacitance;supply noise measurements;supply noise prediction;timing margin;worst-case jitter measurements","","0","","21","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, many researches have been conducted to improve the storage density and enhance the scalability of STT-RAM, such as reducing the write current and switching time of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) devices. In parallel with these efforts, the continuous increasing of tunnel magneto-resistance(TMR) ratio of the MTJ inspires the development of multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM, which allows multiple data bits be stored in a single memory cell. Two types of MLC STT-RAM cells, namely, parallel MLC and series MLC, were also proposed. The storage margin of a MLC STT-RAM cell, i.e., the distinction between the lowest and highest resistance states, is partitioned into multiple segments for multi-level data representation. As a result, the performance and reliability of MLC STT-RAM cells become more sensitive to the MOS and MTJ device variations and the thermal-induced randomness of MTJ switching. In this work, we systematically analyze the variation sources of MLC STT-RAM designs and their impacts on the reliability of the read and write operations. On top of that, we also discuss the optimal device parameters of the MLC MTJ for the minimization of the operation error rate of the MLC STT-RAM cells from statistical design perspective. Our simulation results show that under the current available technology, series MLC STT-RAM demonstrates overwhelming benefits in the read and write reliability compared to parallel MLC STT-RAM and could potentially satisfy the requirement of commercial practices.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386721","","Current density;Error analysis;Magnetic domains;Magnetic tunneling;Magnetization;Resistance;Switches","integrated circuit reliability;minimisation;random-access storage;tunnelling magnetoresistance","MOS device;MTJ device;MTJ switching;STT-RAM scalability;magnetic tunneling junction;minimization;multilevel cell STT-RAM;multilevel data representation;nonvolatile memory technology;reliability;single memory cell;spin-transfer torque random access memory;statistical design;storage density;thermal-induced randomness;tunnel magnetoresistance ratio;write current","","2","","19","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the lack of supporting synthesis tools in current DPR design flow, leveraging these benefits requires specific designer expertise with laborious manual design effort. Considering the complicated concurrency relations among functions, it is challenging to properly select Partial Reconfiguration Modules (PR Modules) and partition them into groups so that the hardware modules can be swapped in and out during the run time. What's more, the design of PR Modules also impacts reconfiguration latency and resource utilization greatly. In this paper, we formulate the PR Module generation problem into a standard Maximum-Weight Independent Set Problem (MWISP) so that the original manual exploration can be solved optimally and automatically. Our proposed algorithm not only supports various design constraints, but also has the ability to consider multiple objectives such as area and reconfiguration delay. Experimental results show that our approach can optimize resource utilization and reduce reconfiguration delay with good scalability. Especially, the implementation of the real design case shows that our approach can be embedded in the Xilinx's DPR design flow successfully and it can save around 70% reconfiguration latency overhead compared with the heuristic PR Module generation approaches.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386716","Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration;FPGA;Independent set-based model;Partial Reconfiguration Module","Algorithm design and analysis;Concurrent computing;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Optimization;Resource management","field programmable gate arrays;logic design","FPGA;ISBA;Xilinx's DPR design;automated partial reconfiguration module generation;dynamic partial reconfiguration;hardware modules;independent set-based algorithm;maximum-weight independent set problem;reconfiguration latency;resource utilization","","0","","25","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent advances in semiconductor process technology especially interconnects using Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) enable heterogeneous system integration where dies are implemented in dedicated, optimized process technologies and then stacked together to form a system. Compared to conventional wire-bond chip interconnections, TSVs offer several advantages such as high density, low latency, low power, and possibly lower cost. TSVs provide vertical interconnects and hence naturally used for 3D vertical stacking of multiple dies, However, TSVs also have attractive benefits in interconnecting dies, which are placed next to each other on top of a passive silicon interposer. TSMC has proposed CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) process as the standard design paradigm to assemble interposer-based 3D ICs. Figure 1 shows an example of a CoWoS design with three heterogeneous (RF, logic and memory) dies. In order to reach quality requirements for volume production, several challenges need to be resolved for 3D ICs. Many of these challenges open up new horizon for the EDA industry and academia as they require innovative and compute efficient approaches. One of the critical challenges is effective and efficient testing of 3D ICs. Just like traditional 2D chips, 3D chips need to be tested for possible manufacturing defects. To minimize any yield loss and reduce overall cost, each die should not only be fully tested before stacking, but also post-stacking re-testing of individual dies is required to confirm that the stacking process did not damage the individual die. In addition, a new kind of test must be performed to check that inter-die interconnects are defects free. Furthermore, the passive silicon interposer needs to be tested in order to not become the bottleneck and the major yield killer in the overall design process. In this paper, we describe some of the innovative solutions developed by TSMC in this direction. The paper highlights complexities and- issues related to test architecture development and automation, test flow optimization as well as testing of passive interposer that requires special focus from the EDA industry.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386621","3D Stacked ICs;Design-for-Test;Silicon Interposer;Test Architecture and Wrappers","Companies;Conferences;Industries;Manufacturing;Silicon;Stacking;Testing","assembling;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;three-dimensional integrated circuits","2D chips;3D IC testing;3D vertical stacking;CoWoS process design;EDA industry;TSMC;TSV;chip-on-wafer-on-substrate process;complex 3D chip design;heterogeneous dies;heterogeneous system integration;interdie interconnects;interposer-based 3D IC assembly;manufacturing defects;optimized process technology;passive silicon interposer;post-stacking retesting;semiconductor process technology;test architecture development;test flow optimization;through-silicon vias interconnects;volume production;wire-bond chip interconnections;yield loss","","2","","","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circuit performance based on this technique relies on the accuracy of capacitance ratios, which are affected by random and systematic mismatches. To meet the accuracy requirement, designers can increase the layout area of unit capacitors to reduce random mismatch. Since increasing layout area enlarges the distance between unit capacitors, it induces more gradient errors, which results in larger systematic mismatch. Therefore, the better way for reducing the gradient errors is to carefully determine the locations of unit capacitors in a capacitor array. Moreover, the resulting placement must have high capacitance correlation in order to enhance yield. In this paper, we first explore the attributes of a good capacitor placement, which can reduce gradient errors and increase capacitance correlation. Then, an analytical-based approach is proposed to complete capacitor placement considering these issues. Finally, the results are optimized by arbitrarily swapping two unit capacitors. Compared with the simulated annealing based approach, the proposed method not only achieves better placement results but also gets 34x faster for the largest benchmark capacitor array.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386738","Analog placement;capacitor array","Arrays;Capacitance;Capacitors;Correlation;Dispersion;Indexes;Symmetric matrices","analogue integrated circuits;capacitors;gradient methods;integrated circuit layout;simulated annealing","accuracy requirement;analog design;analog integrated circuits;capacitance correlation;capacitance ratios;capacitor array;capacitor placement;circuit performance;device correlation enhancement;gradient error compensation;gradient errors;layout area;simulated annealing;switched capacitors;systematic mismatches;unit capacitors","","0","","29","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing TS optimization techniques achieve this objective with post-synthesis techniques such as gate sizing or body biasing. In this work, we propose to conduct logic synthesis for timing-speculated circuits from the ground up.

A data fusion strategy based on Bayesian inference, which combines information from these two sources, is demonstrated along with a temperature estimation approach using performance counters. The approaches are verified via simulation for an AMD Athlon 64 processor with 24 on-chip temperature sensors scaled to a 45nm technology node. Our results show that the standard deviation of temperature sensor measurement errors can be reduced from 3 ~ 4°C to ≤ 1°C using the proposed method.

This paper formally demonstrates an optimal way to reduce energy via voltage over-scaling at the cost of errors due to timing starvation in addition. We identify a fundamental trade-off between error frequency and error magnitude in a timing-starved adder. We introduce a formal model to prove that for signal processing applications using a quadratic signal-to-noise ratio error measure, reducing bit-wise error frequency is sub-optimal. Instead, energy-optimal approximate addition requires limiting maximum error magnitude. Intriguingly, due to possible error patterns, this is achieved by reducing carry chains significantly below what is allowed by the timing budget for a large fraction of sum bits, using an aligned, fixed internal-carry structure for higher significance bits. We further demonstrate that remaining approximation error is reduced by realization of conditional bounding (CB) logic for lower significance bits. A key contribution is the formalization of an approximate CB logic synthesis problem that produces a rich space of Pareto-optimal adders with a range of quality-energy tradeoffs. We show how CB logic can be customized to result in over-and under-estimating approximate adders, and how a dithering adder that mixes them produces zero-centered error distributions, and, in accumulation, a reduced-variance error. We demonstrate synthesized approximate adders with energy up to 60% smaller than that of a conventional timing-starved adder, where a 30% reduction is due to the superior synthesis of inexact CB logic. When used in a larger system implementing an image-processing algorithm, energy savings of 40% are possible.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386754","","Adders;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Measurement uncertainty;PSNR;Silicon;Timing","adders;approximation theory;logic design","CB logic synthesis;bit-wise error frequency reduction;conditional bounding logic synthesis;energy savings;error frequency;error magnitude;fixed internal-carry structure;image-processing algorithm;quadratic signal-to-noise ratio error measurement;quality-energy optimal approximate adders;reduced-variance error;signal processing applications;timing starvation;voltage over-scaling","","5","","15","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it still has been an extremely challenging task to develop general-purpose preconditioning methods that can deal with various large-scale nonlinear circuit simulations. In this work, a novel circuit-oriented, generalpurpose support-circuit preconditioning technique (GPSCP) is proposed to significantly improve the matrix solving time and reduce the memory consumption during large-scale nonlinear circuit simulations. We show that by decomposing the system Jacobian matrix at a given solution point into a graph Laplacian matrix as well as a matrix including all voltage and controlled sources, and subsequently sparsifying the graph Laplacian matrix based on support graph theory, the general-purpose support-circuit preconditioning matrix can be efficiently obtained, thereby serving as a very effective and efficient preconditioner in solving the original Jacobian matrix through Krylov-subspace iterations. Additionally, a novel critical node selection method and an energy-based spanning-graph scaling method have been proposed to further improve the quality of ultra-sparsifier support graph. To gain higher computational efficiency during transient circuit analysis, a dynamic support-circuit preconditioner updating approach has also been investigated. Our experimental results for a variety of large-scale nonlinear circuit designs show that the proposed technique can achieve up to 14.0X runtime speedups and 6.7X memory reduction in DC and transient simulations.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386703","","Integrated circuit modeling;Jacobian matrices;Laplace equations;Matrix decomposition;Nonlinear circuits;Sparse matrices;Transient analysis","Jacobian matrices;Laplace equations;SPICE;circuit simulation;graph theory;nonlinear network analysis;transient analysis","DC simulations;GPSCP;Jacobian matrix;Krylov-subspace iterations;Laplacian matrix;direct solution methods;energy-based spanning-graph scaling;general-purpose preconditioning;general-purpose support-circuit preconditioning;graph theory;large-scale SPICE-accurate nonlinear circuit simulations;matrix solving time;memory consumption;preconditioned iterative solution;transient circuit analysis;transient simulations;ultra-sparsifier support graph","","0","","14","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the operation of brain logic is still an unsolved problem, noise-based logic shows potential advantages of reduced power dissipation and the ability of large parallel operations with low hardware and time complexity. But there is a fundamental question: is randomness really needed out of orthogonality? Orthogonal signal systems (similarly to orthogonal noises) can also represent multidimensional logic spaces and superpositions. So, does randomness add any advantage to orthogonality or is it disadvantageous due to the required statistical evaluation of signals? In this talk, after some general physical considerations, we show and analyze some specific examples to compare the computational complexities of logic systems based on orthogonal noise and sinusoidal signal systems, respectively. The conclusion is that, in certain special-purpose applications that are particularly relevant for mimicking quantum informatics, noise-based logic is exponentially better than its sinusoidal version: its computational complexity (time and hardware) can exponentially be smaller to perform the same task.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386602","Noise-based logic;orthogonality;random telegraph waves;randomness;sinusoidal signals","Entropy;Fluctuations;Harmonic analysis;Noise;Vectors","circuit noise;computational complexity;logic circuits","brain logic;computational complexity;logic states;logic systems;multidimensional logic spaces;noise based logic;noise-based logic;orthogonal noises;orthogonal signal systems;power dissipation;quantum informatics;sinusoidal signal systems;statistical evaluation","","0","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since most chips are fabricated at process conditions better than the worst-case corner, adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) is commonly used to reduce power consumption whenever possible. A typical AVS setup relies on a performance monitor that replicates critical paths of the circuit to guide voltage scaling. However, it is difficult to define appropriate critical paths for an SoC which has multiple operating modes and IPs. In this paper, we propose a different methodology for AVS which matches the voltage scaling characteristics of a circuit rather than the delays of critical paths. This fundamental change in monitoring strategy simplifies the monitoring circuitry as well as the calibration flow of conventional monitoring methods. To enable the proposed methodology, we study voltage scaling characteristics of digital circuits. Based on our analyses, we develop design guidelines as well as design monitoring circuits which have tunable voltage scaling characteristics. Our experimental results show that this methodology can be used for AVS with a simplified calibration flow.","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386582","","Frequency measurement;Monitoring;Resistance;Sensors;Silicon;System-on-a-chip;Voltage measurement","VLSI;calibration;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit measurement;sensors;system-on-chip","AVS;SoC;VLSI circuits;adaptive voltage scaling;calibration flow;critical path delay;design monitoring circuits;digital circuits;monitoring strategy;power consumption;process-aware voltage scaling;tunable sensors;voltage scaling characteristics;worst-case process variation","","0","","24","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the design flow of EWOD chips, reliability is a critical challenge as it directly affects execution of bioassays. The major factor to degrade chip reliability is the trapped charge problem, which is induced by excessive applied voltage. Nevertheless, to comply with the pin constraint for PDMFBs, signal merging is inevitably involved, and thereby incurring trapped charges due to unawareness of applied voltage. Except for the trapped charge problem, wire routing to accomplish electrical connections increases the design complexity of pin-constrained EWOD chips. Unfortunately, no existing works tackle the problems of excessive applied voltage and wire routing, and thus the resultant chip will have more probabilities to fail during execution or can not be realized because of wire routing problem. In this paper, we present a network-flow based algorithm for reliability-driven pin-constrained EWOD chips with the consideration of voltage issue. Our algorithm not only minimizes the reliability problem induced by signal merging but also provides a comprehensive routing solution for EWOD chip-level designs.

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 13 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, including USA, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea, Italy, and Taiwan. Continuing its great success in 2012, 2013 CAD contest attracts 87 teams from 9 regions, including USA, Canada, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, achieving 55% growth. Three contest problems on technology mapping, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Hwei-Tseng Wang of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on technology mapping for macro blocks. The implementation of a digital function is more flexible and powerful as technology advances. Therefore, how to fully utilize and reuse macro blocks in a highly optimized design becomes an important issue. However, it is challenging to identify the boundaries of macro blocks in such complex netlists. For the first problem, contestants are required to map and replace a given design by a set of macro blocks as much as possible. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on the placement finishing step, detailed placement and legalization. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. Although there are significant improvements on global placement techniques via recent placement contests, the need for high performance detailed placeme- t continues to grow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total wirelength, placement/pin density are optimized. Topic chair Shayak Banerjee of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. As technology advances, the printed feature size is smaller than the wavelength of the light shining through the mask. The subwavelength gap causes unwanted shape distortions. To compensate these distortions, mask optimization is performed. For the third problem, contestants are required to find the best mask solution for a given pixelated layout. The best mask solution means least EPE violations and minimum process variations over different corners measured by a provided lithography simulation model. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691128","Technology mapping;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Force;Integrated circuits;Iris;Lithography;Optimization","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;lithography","CAD contest;DAC contest;EDA domain;Hong Kong;IC design flow;ICCAD;IEEE CEDA;ISPD contest;Italy;Japan;Korea;Mainland China;Ministry of Education;TAU contest;Taiwan;USA;United States of America;circuit elements;computer aided design;detailed placement;electronic design automation;integrated circuit design flow;legalization;lithography mask optimization;lithography simulation model;macro blocks;mask optimization;placement finishing step;research and development","","0","","","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 14 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, while 2013 CAD contest attracted 87 teams from 9 regions. Continuing its great success in 2012 and 2013, 2014 CAD contest attracts 93 teams from 9 regions, including Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, US, Canada, Brazil, and Russian Federation. Three contest problems on verification, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Chih-Jen Hsu of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on efficiently solving the combinational single-output netlists. The efficiency of solving a single-output function highly depends on the CNF encoding and the SAT solving. For the first problem, contestants are required to explore the best CNF encoding and SAT solver setting to solve the most tests within the shortest runtime. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on incremental timing-driven placement. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total slack and worst slack are optimized. Topic chair Rasit O. Topaloglu of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. In a circuit layout, densities of polygons within windows of interest may have a large v- riation across such windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, fills are inserted to make the density of several windows uniform. For the third problem, contestants are required to minimize the density variation with least fills. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001374","Verification;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Educational institutions;Encoding;Force;Integrated circuits;Optimization","","","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
