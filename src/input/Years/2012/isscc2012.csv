Conventional routers use distinct logic blocks for routing data and handling arbitration. At higher radices, connections between these blocks become a bottleneck, limiting router scalability and degrading performance. Recently, two switch topologies merged the data routing fabric with arbitration control, avoiding this bottleneck. However, relies on centralized control for channel allocation, limiting performance, while restricted to a small set of fixed priorities, rendering input ports prone to starvation. In addition, ever larger CMPs will require continued increases in bandwidth over previous designs. To address these issues, we present a 64x64 single-stage swizzle-switch network (SSN) with 128b data buses (8192 total input/output wires). The SSN can connect any input to any output, including multicast. It has a peak measured throughput of 4.5Tb/s at 1.1V in 45nm SOI CMOS at 25°C. The SSN's key features are: 1) a single-cycle least-recently granted (LRG) priority arbitration technique that reuses the already present input and output data buses and their drivers and sense amps; 2) an additional 4-level message-based priority arbitration for quality of service (QoS) with 2% logic and 3% wiring overhead; 3) a bidirectional bitline repeater that allows the router to scale to >;8000 wires. These features result in a compact fabric (4.06mm2) with throughput gain of 2.1 x over at 3.4Tb/s/W efficiency, which improves to 7.4Tb/s/W at 600mV.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177098","","Delay;Fabrics;Quality of service;Repeaters;Routing;Switches;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;logic circuits;low-power electronics;quality of service;silicon-on-insulator;switched networks","QoS;SOI CMOS;bidirectional bitline repeater;bit rate 4.5 Tbit/s;channel allocation;data buses;data routing fabric;drivers;energy efficiency;high-speed routers;limiting router scalability;logic blocks;low-power routers;on-die interconnect fabrics;quality-of-service arbitration;self-updating least-recently-granted priority arbitration technique;sense amplifier;single-stage swizzle-switch network;size 45 nm;switch fabric;switch topology;temperature 25 degC;voltage 1.1 V;voltage 600 mV;wiring overhead;word length 128 bit","","0","","8","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The PA for GSM [1] was insufficient for our target, so we needed to greatly improve the linearity in order to comply with the W-CDMA standard, which has better frequency-usage efficiency. Conventional CMOS PAs only support a single band [2,3] or are for WLAN [4] where the output power level is low (typically about 20dBm).

DDR4 SDRAM is the next-generation memory that meets these demands in computing and server systems. In comparison with current DDR3 memory, the major changes are supply voltage reduction to 1.2V, pseudo open drain I/O interface, and data rate increase from 1.6 to 3.2Gb/s. To achieve high performance at low supply voltage and reduce power consumption, this work introduces new functions and describes their implementation. Data bus inversion (DBI) is employed for high-speed transactions to reduce power consumption of I/O and SSN noise. Dual-error detection, which adopts cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for DQ, and command address (CA) parity is designed to guarantee reliable transmission.

A multi-modality transceiver block compatible with different transmission media is highly desirable as it offers great versatility by allowing the exact same interface circuitry to be used with different transmission media.

However, a number of SC converter topologies are very effective in their utilization of switches and passive elements, especially in relation to the ever-popular buck converters [1,2,5]. This work encompasses the complete design, fabrication, and test of a CMOS-based switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, addressing the ubiquitous 12 to 1.5V board-mounted point-of-load application. In particular, the circuit developed in this work attains higher efficiency (92% peak, and >;80% over a load range of 5mA to 1A) than surveyed competitive buck converters, while requiring less board area and less costly passive components. The topology and controller enable a wide input voltage (V<sub>!N</sub>) range of 7.5 to 13.5V with an output voltage (V<sub>οuτ</sub>) of 1.5V Control techniques based on feedback and feedforward provide tight regulation (30mV<sub>pp</sub>) under worst-case load-step (1A) conditions.

One of the popular solutions is the flyback converter which is widely used in low-to-moderate power applications [2]. However, generally, it requires secondary voltage or current-sense circuit, and opto-coupler isolator to form a feedback loop. Thus, primary-side regulation (PSR) flyback converters have been steadily used in LED applications since they do not need secondary circuits and isolator [3].

To resolve this problem, dual-tuning PLLs (DT-PLLs) have been studied [1-4]. The DT-PLL structure adds a narrow-bandwidth coarse (high-K<sub>VCO</sub>) path to the fine (low-K<sub>VCO</sub>) path consisting of a type-II PLL. The narrow-bandwidth analog filter in the coarse path plays an important role in preventing the charge pump and the loop filter from increasing the output jitter, while a wide-tuning range is maintained. Moreover, the coarse path adds another pole at origin to the fine path and transforms it from a type-II to type-III PLL [3-4]. Compared to a type-II PLL, owing to its boosted low-frequency loop gain, a type-III PLL can better suppress a low-frequency disturbance to the ring VCO, such as temperature drift. However, a type-III PLL has stability problems. To ensure sufficient phase margin (PM), a type-III PLL requires an extremely narrow-bandwidth (e.g. ~10-100Hz) analog filter in the coarse path or must make the K<sub>VCO</sub> of the fine path larger. The former requires a nano-Farad capacitor or a fairly complex design for shrinking the capacitance, while the latter way increases total jitter. This paper presents a digitally stabilized type-Ill PLL with a ring VCO. It employs a DT-PLL structure and improves its stability by composing the coarse path with a digital integrator and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). It can set the K<sub>vco</sub> of the fine path to 10MHz/V, which is 1000χ lower than that of the coarse path with a sufficient PM. For further in-band phase-noise reduction, the proposed type-Ill PLL adopts a sub-sampling PLL (SS-PLL) in its fine path [5], and achieves 1.01 ps<sub>rms</sub> integrated jitter.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176996","","Frequency measurement;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Phase noise;Solid state circuits;Transient analysis;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;charge pump circuits;circuit stability;circuit tuning;digital-analogue conversion;integrated circuit noise;jitter;phase locked loops;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS;DAC;DT-PLL structure;VCO control gain;charge pump;digital integrator;digital-to-analog converter;digitally stabilized type-III PLL;dual-tuning PLL;in-band phase-noise reduction;integrated jitter;loop filter;low-frequency disturbance;low-frequency loop gain;low-jitter VCO-based PLL;narrow-bandwidth analog filter;narrow-bandwidth coarse;output jitter;phase margin;phase noise contribution;ring VCO;size 65 nm;stability;subsampling PLL;temperature drift;wide-tuning range","","1","","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An integrated readout was designed for the tracking of resonant frequency shift due to a change in the VOC environment concentration. It interfaces a piezo-actuated functionalized doubly clamped beam resonator that combines low actuation power (μW), high VOC sensitivity but low quality factor in air, large parasitic capacitance and multiple resonance modes.

The first problem is the self-startup capability. Because many wireless sensor nodes are likely to be located where human-maintenance is difficult, starting them up manually can be as difficult as replacing the battery. Its realization has been difficult because μEHs must be able to turn itself on without any stored energy. Some previous works have reported such a function: some needed high voltage [1] or vibration [2] and one used a transformer as a starter [3]. The other problem is the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) capability. Because it is known that MPPT algorithms usually require considerable power consumption [4], using them in μEHs is impractical. This paper suggests a new boost converter architecture and MPPT control method which can bring μEH into practical use.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176895","","Conferences;Energy harvesting;Generators;Switches;Voltage control;Voltage measurement","energy harvesting;power convertors;transformers;wireless sensor networks","MPPT control method;boost converter architecture;maximum power point tracking capability;micro-energy harvesters;power consumption;seamless energy source;self-startup capability;thermoelectric energy harvesting;transformer-reuse self-startup boost converter;voltage 40 mV;wireless sensor node","","5","","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the down side, unlike batteries that provide a stable power source, unexpected variations in the coils' mutual coupling from misalignments can lead to wide variations in the received voltage across the secondary coil to the extent that the input voltage may not be sufficient to supply power to the IMD [3]. Hence, there is a need to improve the robustness of inductive power transmission without sacrificing efficiency to allow the IMDs to operate over a wider range of received input voltages.

Recently, in mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs, higher performance is required to support 3D gaming mode and high-quality video.

DRAMs with wide I/O or serial I/O have been reviewed as candidates for over 6.4GB/s channel bandwidth. However, wide-I/O DRAMs [1] must solve issues such as stacking yield for higher density and failure analysis modeling of system-in-package (SiP), and most serial I/Os have worse I/O power efficiency than LPDDR2. For an evolutionary successor of LPDDR2, therefore, we design a 1.2V 1.6Gb/s/pin ×32 4Gb low-power DDR3 SDRAM (LPDDR3) with input skew calibration and enhanced refresh control schemes, achieving 6.4GB/s total data bandwidth.

In order to increase the LED driver efficiency, besides controlling the LED current, it is necessary to regulate the voltage applied to the LED itself, to minimize the voltage drop across the driver current source and, hence, the power consumption. Depending on the kind of LED and on the current forced through the LED itself (0.1 to 2A in this design) and, hence, on the desired light emission, the voltage required to drive the LED, while maintaining the voltage headroom across the driver current source to the minimum, varies over a wide range (0 to 5V).

While FMCW is an excellent approach for accurate ranging, its implementation becomes particularly difficult at high frequencies as the resolution is heavily dependent on sweep linearity and the high RF front-end performance required to support the wideband swept carrier. For 3D mm-Wave imaging applications, this high operating frequency is indispensable as the attainable spatial (XY) resolution is fundamentally limited by the wavelength of the imaging system.

The performance variation of general circuits is predicted to be over 60% in 2012. In general, a single-die-based DRAM has a large process variation from chip to chip, which among other parameters, causes tAC (address access time) variation in the application system. In order to reduce the tAC variation, most highspeed SDRAMs adopt a delay-locked loop (DLL) at the cost of additional area and power consumption. For TSV-based stacked dies, large tAC variantion results in higher power consumption due to short circuit current from data conflicts among shared I/Os. Since the number of I/Os for TSV-based stacked DRAM (TSV DRAM) might be 512 or more, the additional power consumption can be very high. Even though it is desirable in mobile DRAM to exclude the DLL because of the power cost, TSV DRAM for high-speed operation partially adopts a DLL in the master die.

Minimizing the carbon footprint of each node is paramount from the sustainability perspective. In ultra-low-power applications, the life-cycle carbon footprint results from a complex balance between both embodied and use-phase energies [1]. The embodied energy arises mainly from CMOS chip manufacturing, and is essentially proportional to die area. Use-phase energy depends on both active and sleep-mode power, because of long stand-by periods in WSNs. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power 25MHz microcontroller SoC that fully exploits the versatility of a 65nm CMOS process with a low-power/general-purpose (LP/GP) transistor mix (dual-core oxide) to obtain: i) 7μW/MHz active power consumption due to a 0.4V ultra-low-voltage (ULV) thin-core-oxide (GP) CPU supplied by a 78%-efficiency embedded DC/DC converter; ii) 0.66mm<sup>2</sup> die area for low embodied energy due to a compact converter design and a dual-V<sub>DD</sub> architecture, enabling the use of the foundry's 1V high-density 6T SRAM bitcell; and, iii) 1.5μW sleep-mode power due to body-biased sleep transistors embedded into the converter and thick-core-oxide (LP) MOSFETs for retentive SRAM and always-on peripherals (AOP). Moreover, an on-chip adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) system controlling the converter ensures safe 25MHz operation at ULV for all PVT conditions. A multi-V<sub>t</sub> clock tree is also proposed to achieve reliable timing closure with low-power SoC features. Finally, a glitch-masking instruction cache (I$) is implemented to reduce the access power of the 1V program memory (PMEM).","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177104","","Clocks;MOSFETs;Microcontrollers;Random access memory;Synchronization;System-on-a-chip;Wireless sensor networks","CMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;MOSFET;SRAM chips;microcontrollers;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;system-on-chip;wireless sensor networks","AVS system;CMOS chip manufacturing;Internet of Things;LP-GP CMOS;PMEM;PVT conditions;SRAM;ULV conditions;active power consumption;always-on peripherals;ambient intelligence;body-biased sleep transistors;compact converter design;die area;dual-VDD architecture;embedded DC-DC converter;embodied energies;frequency 25 MHz;glitch-masking instruction cache;high-density 6T SRAM bitcell;life-cycle carbon footprint minimization;low-carbon wireless sensor nodes;low-power-general-purpose transistor mix;multiV<sub>t</sub> clock tree;on-chip adaptive voltage scaling system;power 7 muW;program memory;size 65 nm;sleep-mode power;sustainability perspective;thick-core-oxide MOSFET;trillion connected wireless sensor nodes;ultra-low-voltage microcontroller SoC;ultra-low-voltage thin-core-oxide;use-phase energies","","6","","8","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the 2P-SRAM is placed in front of large scale logic circuitry for image processing, a faster access time (e.g., <;1 ns) is required. In general, the read-out operation in 2P-SRAM utilizes full-swing of the single read bitline (BL), so a drastic improvement of the access time is not expected.

In this area, savings will come from three sources: more efficient appliances (with an estimated 60% reduction), intelligent lighting and HVAC (with up to 50% reduction), and increased energy-consumption consciousness at the consumer level, thanks to energy monitoring in-house systems (with up to 20% potential saving). Furthermore, the advent of the Smart Grid will contribute to energy saving and to eco-sustainability. Grid optimization, through the improved modeling and control that will be possible with the deployment of Smart Meters and Automatic Meter Infrastructures (AMI), will significantly reduce infrastructure losses.

Expansion of such applications is going to require more human-friendly and humanlike interactive systems. Improvements in energy efficiency, dependability, security, intelligent sensor networks are among technologies, which are expected from the next generation silicon system, that provide the means to the development of the next generation interactive robots.

SoCs for such image recognition applications are required to be powerful enough to support real-time multiple object recognition, with power consumption not exceeding a few Watts. Adaptability to a range of applications is also desirable. In this context, massively parallel processors and heterogeneous many-core processors with 200GOPS have been proposed. However, rising demands for simultaneous execution of multiple applications leads to even higher performance requirements. In advanced driver-assistance systems for automotive, for example, forward collision warning and traffic sign recognition should execute simultaneously to improve safety of the system. In addition, the accuracy of recognition is also important. With its high accuracy (96% detection rate/0.1% false-positive rate), object recognition using co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) is a promising algorithm. However, the algorithm requires an extensive amount of computation. For example, a desktop computer with a 3GHz quad-core processor is needed for CoHOG-based pedestrian detection in a backover prevention (BOP) application. Considering these requirements, we have developed an image recognition SoC with the following features: 1) a multi-core processor to provide adaptability to various applications; 2) accelerators for image processing tasks and image recognition tasks to realize high performance at low power consumption; and, 3) a hardware accelerator for a CoHOG based real-time recognition.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176984","","Histograms;Image recognition;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Power demand;Program processors;System-on-a-chip","digital signal processing chips;image recognition;multiprocessing systems;object recognition;system-on-chip","automotive;backover prevention application;cooccurrence histogram;desktop computer;driver assistance systems;forward collision warning;frequency 3 GHz;hardware accelerator;heterogeneous many-core processor;heterogeneous multicore SoC;image processing task;image recognition;multicore processor;object recognition;oriented gradient;parallel processor;pedestrian detection;quad-core processor;real-time recognition;surveillance;traffic sign recognition","","7","","7","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, this technique is suitable for addressing both linearity and flexibility requirements in wideband and cognitive radio applications. However, given the typically low resistance level at the RF side of the receiver chain, the RC product necessary for filtering results in large capacitors, and, consequently, large die area that does not scale with technology. In addition, filter rejection at the RF side is limited by the resistance of the switches of the passive mixer. Thus, large switches are typically needed for moderate rejection values (5Ω switches for 16dB rejection [2]), which translates to higher power consumption in the LO buffers. Furthermore, filtering prior to the LNA [1] or eliminating it altogether [3] improves linearity at the expense of noise and switching harmonics being injected directly at the antenna node. Conversely, an LNA first architecture offers an opposite trade-off. This work demonstrates a highly compact design of a direct-conversion receiver with an active feedback frequency translation loop to perform channel selection at the LNA output while simultaneously cancelling its distortion.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176961","","Gain measurement;Noise measurement;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Receivers;Semiconductor device measurement;Wideband","CMOS integrated circuits;distortion;mixers (circuits);passive networks;radio receivers","CMOS;LNA output;active feedback frequency translation loop;active feedback receiver;cognitive radio applications;direct-conversion receiver;distortion cancelling;filter rejection;impedance transformation property;integrated high-Q channel selection;integrated tunable RF channel selectivity;low resistance level;passive mixers;programmable center frequency;size 65 nm;stopband rejection;wideband IIP3","","0","","7","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pioneering recent work [2-5] has demonstrated frequency synthesizers that meet the performance requirements of wireless communications systems, while containing no analog circuits except for an LC-oscillator. In order to build an All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL), it is necessary to measure the oscillator's momentary phase accurately, in a digital way, since the output phase noise at frequencies within the PLL loop bandwidth is ultimately limited by the time quantisation step Δt of this phase measurement [6]: L=20.log<sub>10</sub> (Δt·ω<sub>osc</sub>/√12·√f<sub>sample</sub>) [dBc/Hz] (1) In [2-5], a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is used to measure the oscillator's phase with a resolution of a single inverter delay. However, this approach requires calibration of the TDC conversion gain. Previous work [2] included a small microprocessor incorporated in the PLL circuit, to perform all necessary calculations related to the calibration. Obviously, this renders the circuit complex, is prone to calibration errors and consumes power and area. In this paper, an alternative approach is presented, allowing all-digital frequency synthesizers that meet the requirements for wireless communications standards, that benefit from the benign scaling properties, porting properties, process independence and controlled design flow, inherent to digital circuits, but that, on the other hand, do not require the burden of calibration and associated calculations.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177039","","Calibration;Frequency measurement;Frequency synthesizers;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement;Phase noise;Quantization","CMOS integrated circuits;frequency synthesizers;oscillators;phase locked loops;phase noise;time-digital conversion","ADPLL;CMOS;LC-oscillator;PLL loop bandwidth;Phase-Locked Loop;TDC;all-digital fractional-N synthesizer;bang-bang all-digital PLL;frequency synthesizer;phase noise performance;size 40 nm;time-to-digital converter","","4","","7","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These studies suggest that noticeable merits can be achieved by using PRAM in improving power consumption, system cost, etc. However, relatively low chip density and insufficient write bandwidth of PRAMs are obstacles to better system performance. In this paper, we present an 8Gb PRAM with 40MB/s write bandwidth featuring 8Mb sub-array core architecture with 20nm diode-switched PRAM cells [4].

High-performance opamps that meet the requirements for dc gain, speed, and signal range usually consume large power. We propose a scheme where the residue amplification is performed first by a coarse amplifier (CA), and then by a fine amplifier (FA). The CA generates a large-swing output that may not be accurate due to low dc gain and slow speed. Subsequently, the FA produces a small-swing output that stands as the error of the CA. The requirements for the CA and FA are different. They can be designed and optimized separately, resulting in low power dissipation. We report a 10b SC pipelined ADC to demonstrate this technique. Fabricated in 65nm CMOS, this ADC achieves 56.7dB SNDR at 200MS/s sampling rate, and consumes 5.37mW from a 1V supply.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177091","","CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;Clocks;Frequency measurement;Pipelines;Power dissipation;Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;low-power electronics;operational amplifiers;sample and hold circuits","CMOS;coarse amplifier;dc gain;dual-path pipelined ADC;fine amplifier;high-performance opamps;low power dissipation;power 5.37 mW;residue amplification;residue generation;sample-and-hold;signal range;size 65 nm;small-swing output;switched-capacitor pipelined ADC;voltage 1 V","","6","","3","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using frequency multipliers with high efficiency and multiplication factor to generate the N<sup>th</sup> harmonic signal that is phase-locked by a PLL at the fundamental frequency provides an alternative solution. The desired signal in an active frequency multiplier can be generated using Class B/C amplifiers, where a half-wave signal containing all harmonics is first created and then filtered to remove the undesired harmonic components [1]. Another approach is to apply the same signal to both the IF and RF ports of a mixer to construct a doubler followed by cascading to form the quadrupler [3]. The linear superposition (LS) technique that superimposes four phase-shifted half-waves of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° is another popular scheme [5]. For multipliers with high multiplication factors, these prior techniques may offer very low power efficiency (η). Quadrupler cores based on Class B/C amplifiers, mixers, or the LS technique had been reported with η of 0.9% [1], 0.04% [3] and 0.0002% [5], respectively. Therefore, instead of improving the η of the multiplier cores, the design of the subsequent amplifiers after the multiplier to boost the η and output power has become a popular approach. We have substantially enhanced the η of a frequency quadrupler core using a phase-controlled push-push (PCPP) technique to directly synthesize the 4<sup>th</sup> harmonic. We noted that in an ideal situation, the proposed quadrupler circuit is able to generate almost no other harmonics, attaining an η of 50%. In this paper, we present a 121-to-137GHz frequency quadrupler based on a 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS process. For the purpose of measurement, a balun coupled with buffers to provide the differential signals is also designed. The DC power con- umptions of the quadrupler core and input buffers are 6.4mW and 28.8mW, respectively. Our demonstrated quadrupler core is able to achieve 9% (1.6% including input buffers) power efficiency at 1.6V, with a -2.4dBm output signal.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177008","","BiCMOS integrated circuits;Harmonic analysis;Impedance matching;Power generation;Power harmonic filters;Silicon germanium;Transistors","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;Ge-Si alloys;field effect MIMIC;frequency multipliers;millimetre wave amplifiers;phase locked loops","BiCMOS process;DC power consumptions;IF ports;LS technique;PCPP technique;PLL;RF ports;SiGe;class B-C amplifiers;efficiency 9 percent;frequency 121 GHz to 137 GHz;frequency multipliers;half-wave signal;harmonic components;harmonic signal;high-data-rate short-range communication;image systems;linear superposition technique;phase-controlled push-push frequency quadrupler;phase-controlled push-push technique;phase-shifted half-waves;power 28.8 mW;power 6.4 mW;power efficiency;quadrupler circuit;quadrupler core;signal sources;size 0.13 mum;voltage 1.6 V","","0","","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a remedy, a 3-level switching scheme allows to eliminate the filters, hence helping to reduce the system cost. Moreover, the 3-level switching scheme provides additional benefits of less electromagnetic interference and better power efficiency.

With mismatch among the PV cells, the energy production of the array suffers in several ways: 1) in series strings, current is limited to the lowest-performing cell in the string, 2) if current is forced to exceed this level, external bypass diodes need to turn on throwing away power available in the string and incurring conductive losses, 3) with bypass diodes on, total string voltage may deviate from maximum power voltage (Vmpp), reducing energy production of all modules in the string.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176893","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176893","","Clamps;Insertion loss;Logic gates;Loss measurement;Photovoltaic systems;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;embedded systems;invertors;power conversion;power electronics;power grids;solar cells","carbon-producing source;central inverter;conversion efficiency;distributed photovoltaic energy optimization;embedded system;energy production reduction;external bypass diode;grid parity;grid-connected system;high-voltage CMOS IC;insertion loss;multiple string management;power electronic;series-connected PV module;solar photovoltaic energy","","16","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A conventional AC-coupled BM- RX has an inherent tradeoff between short settling time and decision threshold droop, which makes an RX settling time shorter than 400ns hard to achieve. Some techniques have been developed to overcome this limitation, demonstrating a settling time of 150 to 200ns. Our previous work uses feed-forward automatic offset compensation (AOC) to achieve a response time as short as 25.6ns. However, a feed-forward scheme using peak detectors is intrinsically less accurate and results in relatively high power consumption. In this paper, we present a DC-coupled 10Gb/s BM-TIA and burst-mode limiting amplifier (BM- LA) chipset that uses a feedback type AOC circuit with switchable loop BW. This new technique is capable of removing input DC offset in less than 75ns, and offers continuous decision threshold tracking during payload, to cope with the maximum length of CID. The differential TIA output port senses a CM reset signal provided by the succeeding BM-LA, and activates an on-chip reset and lock function. This BM-LA also integrates auto reset/activity generation circuits providing the AOC BW switching signal, so that this time-critical signal is not required from the PON system.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177071","","Bit error rate;Clocks;Optical switches;Passive optical networks;Radiation detectors;System-on-a-chip","amplifiers;limiters;passive optical networks;signal detection","PON system;auto reset/activity generation circuits;burst-mode TIA;burst-mode limiting amplifier chipset;decision threshold droop;feed-forward automatic offset compensation;feedback type AOC circuit;lock function;network transmission efficiency;on-chip reset/lock CM signaling detection;passive optical network system;peak detectors;time 75 ns;time-critical signal","","4","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, constant monitoring with maximum awareness requires large power consumption and is not suitable for energy-limited applications such as battery-operated and/or energy-scavenging wireless sensor nodes. One of the ways to reduce power is voltage scaling [1-4]. However, it significantly reduces the SNR and results in poor image quality [4]. The signal can be easily corrupted from the noise in dark conditions or be saturated in bright conditions. Most imagers with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range [5,6] consume large power >;50mW, unsuitable for wireless imager node applications. Therefore, it is imperative to implement a sensor adaptable to environmental changes: i.e., the sensor keeps monitoring at extremely low power operation and only turns into high-sensitivity or wide-dynamic-range operations when requested due to illumination changes or requested from the host for detailed image transmission. The sensor changes its operation back to the monitoring mode as a default or when enough operating energy is not available from the battery or energy-harvester. In this paper, we report an adaptive CMOS image sensor that employs four different modes: monitoring, normal, high-sensitivity and wide-dynamic-range (WDR) modes.

The increase in power and circuit complexity in full-rate clocking makes the problem even worse in the design of a parallel transceiver whose clock tree travels through long interconnects. As an alternative to the full-rate clocking, frequency generation with a multiphase PLL has been also considered to relax the tight requirements of operating frequency of oscillator and flip-flops. DRAM interface, as a representative of high-speed parallel links, has adopted quadruple data rate (QDR) schemes for high-speed graphic applications [1-2].

With analog integer-n PLL-based clock generators, it is difficult to meet all these needs with a common reference clock. One disadvantage is that the frequency resolution in an integer-n PLL is limited by the reference frequency. A lower reference frequency limits the bandwidth and lock time, amplifies jitter from the reference, and increases the loop filter area. Additionally, analog PLLs suffer from unpredictable loop dynamics and clock skews with PVT, mismatch, and transistor leakage, further exacerbated by process scaling. Turning off and waking up an analog PLL requires charging or discharging loop filter capacitors which is inherently slow. This paper presents an all-digital clock generation architecture which (1) provides fractional-n capability in the digital domain; (2) implements SSC within the PLL loop; (3) performs digital clock deskew; and (4) provides dynamic loop bandwidth adjustment to shorten lock time.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176934","","Clocks;Computer architecture;Frequency modulation;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits;clocks;phase locked loops","PVT;all-digital clock generation architecture;analog integer-n PLL-based clock generator;clock skews;digital clock deskew;distributed all-digital clock generator core;diverse SSC generation;dynamic loop bandwidth adjustment;frequency resolution;high-k tri-gate LP CMOS;loop dynamics;size 22 nm;skew correction;spread spectrum clocking;transistor leakage","","4","","3","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Column-parallel ≥14b A/D conversion is one of the major approaches to meet these requirements in CMOS image sensors (CIS). Oversampling ADCs such as incremental delta-sigma (I-ΔΣ) ADCs are the solution for a high-resolution ADC having tolerance of analog component errors. Oversampling reduces input temporal noise as well as the quantization error of the ADC itself [1]. However, an I-ΔΣ ADC is also classified as a slow ADC because it requires exponential conversion time to get higher bit resolution. To reduce conversion time, there are two alternative methods: 1) higher-order modulation, and 2) two-step conversion such as an extended-counting technique [2]. In this paper, the extended-counting (EC) method is used since a high-order structure requires more complex hardware and greater power consumption [1,2]. For a general two-step ADC, coarse conversion restricts the total ADC resolution since it determines accuracy of the residue. However, an EC ADC overcomes the accuracy limitation, since the I-ΔΣ can improve its precision through oversampling. Moreover, oversampling also suppresses the noise of the pixel's source follower. Our 14b EC ADC is a blend of a 1<sup>st</sup>-order I-ΔΣ ADC and a cyclic ADC to simultaneously get high resolution and high speed.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177060","","CMOS image sensors;Clocks;Image resolution;Noise;Noise measurement;Signal resolution;Solid state circuits","CMOS image sensors;analogue-digital conversion;delta-sigma modulation","14b EC ADC;14b extended counting ADC;1<sup>st</sup>-order I-ΔΣ ADC;24Mpixel APS-C CMOS image sensor;CIS;I-ΔΣ ADC;analog component errors;cyclic ADC;delta-sigma ADC;extended-counting method;high-quality imaging;high-resolution ADC;high-speed imaging;higher-order modulation;input temporal noise;power consumption;quantization error;two-step ADC;two-step conversion","","1","","3","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, FEXT in parallel microstrip lines causes a significant peak noise due to smaller capacitive coupling by inhomogeneous structure with the upper side exposed to air.

However, conventional CTBPDSMs suffer from large power consumption and occupy large area. CTBPDSMs based on LC tanks are large, while biquad-based resonators are also large and suffer from high power consumption because two amplifiers are usually required in each resonator. The fact that there are typically twice as many feedback paths compared to a lowpass ΔΣ modulator with the same bandwidth and performance also increases power consumption, area and complexity.

Organic RFID tags have been shown, initially using p-type organic semiconductors [1-4]. The introduction of n-type organic semiconductors with reasonable performance made organic CMOS conceivable [5] and organic CMOS RFID tags were shown [6]. However, all currently reported organic RFID tags are based on a tag-talks-first principle: as soon as the tag gets powered from the RF field, its code is transmitted at a data rate determined by an internal ring oscillator. Practical RFID systems will need to be able to read multiple RFID tags within the reach of the reader antenna. Existing anti-collision protocols implemented in organic RFID tags [2,4] are limited to about maximum 4 tags and come at the cost of a slow reading time. In this paper, we for the first time realize a reader-talks-first low-temperature thin-film transistor (TFT) RFID circuit. We use a complementary hybrid organic/oxide technology. As organic transistors with reasonable channel lengths (≥2μm) have a cut-off frequency below 13.56MHz, the base carrier frequency of HF communication, present technologies on foil do not yet allow to extract the circuit clock as a fraction of the base carrier. We solve this by introducing an original uplink (reader-to-tag) scheme, in which a slow clock (compatible with our transistors' speed) is transmitted as amplitude-modulation on the base carrier while data is encoded on this clock by pulse width modulation (PWM).","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177027","","Clocks;Decoding;Inverters;RFID tags;Rectifiers;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;amplitude modulation;pulse width modulation;radiofrequency identification","CMOS;HF hybrid organic-solution-processed metal-oxide RFID tag;amplitude modulation;anticollision protocols;bidirectional communication;complementary hybrid organic/oxide technology;item-level RFID tags;n-type organic semiconductors;organic transistors;printed electronics research;pulse width modulation;reader-talks-first low-temperature thin-film transistor RFID circuit;reader-to-tag scheme;tag-talks-first principle","","11","","8","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main challenge is to improve its power efficiency. Although many linearization and efficiency improvement techniques have been proposed, most of these techniques are based on feed-forward, which may not be effective under varying PVT and load conditions [1-3]. The bandwidth is the issue for feedback techniques such as Cartesian and polar loop. There is a severe trade-off between output power and bandwidth, since generating high output power requires many gain stages including mixers and multiple drivers, which results in a large group delay. To overcome the trade-off, we propose a PA-closed loop, where an integrated feedback directly controls the final stage of a watt-level CMOS PA, as shown in Fig. 4.6.1. Although stable feedback at RF is difficult, separate phase and amplitude feedback can be realized without the stability issue. Large bandwidth and high output power are simultaneously realized, as the loop contains only the PA in the signal path and it is composed of a small number of building blocks. In addition, the proposed architecture is desirable for system integration, as the PA does not require an off-chip linearizer. The feedback improves ACLR with WCDMA output by 6dB, where the output power and PAE are +27.1dBm and 28%, respectively. Thanks to the feedback nature, it can improve the linearity and efficiency with varying load conditions, and is suitable for the increasing isolator-less applications. The linear output power and PAE are improved by up to 2.3dB and 6%, respectively, while the circuits for the loop consume 28.3mW.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176880","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Radio frequency;Spread spectrum communication","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;circuit feedback;code division multiple access;linearisation techniques;power amplifiers;wavelength division multiplexing","ACLR;Cartesian;PA-closed loop;PAE;PVT;WCDMA CMOS power amplifier;amplitude feedback;bandwidth;efficiency 28 percent;efficiency improvement;feedback technique;high output power;isolator-less application;linear output power;linearization;load condition;low-cost fully integrated CMOS PA;phase feedback;polar loop;power 28.3 mW;power efficiency;signal path;system integration;watt-level CMOS PA","","4","","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design of analog DLLs has become a challenge due to the trends associated with CMOS scaling, namely, high leakage current, low supply voltage, etc. Consequently, many designers have shifted their focus to digitally-assisted or all-digitally implemented DLLs, which are easier to design for wide range and fast-locking requirements. Due to the need for wide operating frequency range applications in all-digital DLLs (ADDLLs), many delay cells are normally deployed. As a result, a large portion of the die area is consumed by the delay cells. To address this issue, we develop a phase-tracing delay unit (PTDU) technique to reduce delay-cell usage and achieve low area and low power.

Typical TCSPC apparatus includes a pulsed optical source, a discrete detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT), external time-to-digital conversion (TDC) hardware and a PC to compute the decay constant, resulting in a bulky, expensive and power-hungry acquisition system. A major limitation of this approach is the restrictively low photon count limit of 1-to-5% of the excitation rate, which is necessary in order to avoid distortion due to photon `pile-up' caused by both long detector dead-time and the inability of the TDC hardware to process more than one event per excitation period. As such, promising applications of TCSPC including cell cytometry, confocal microscopy, high throughput screening (HTS), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are severely limited by peak acquisition rates of 1MHz. Although 100MHz has been achieved [2], the approach used is restricted to fluorescent dyes with lifetimes less than 2ns. Recent advances in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and on-chip TDCs manufactured in standard CMOS processes have enabled TCSPC measurements to be performed by an imaging array [3]; however such devices produce data at over 25Gb/s, have low fill factors of ~2% and pixel update rates are limited.

A silicon carbide (SiC) based power switch has a very good performance when it comes to switching and conduction losses. As on silicon, the manufacturing of junction devices is easier than MOSFET devices because the growth of highly reliable oxide is very challenging [1]. Recently, a family of high-voltage SiC junction FET (JFET) transistors has been developed which has made it possible to reach an efficiency of more than 99% with a buck converter. The low switching loss of these transistors allows for the use of a higher switching frequency and smaller external components which in turn reduce PCB area and overall system cost. A dedicated gate driver with possible bootstrap operation has been developed for a normally-on n-type JFET. It allows maximum efficiency, operation as safe as that of a normally-off switch, and reduced number of external components because of integration of voltage regulator and supervision circuitry. Bootstrapping minimizes the number of supplies needed for the power converter and reduces board space and BOM.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177003","","JFETs;Logic gates;MOSFET circuits;Regulators;Silicon carbide;Switches;Voltage control","MOSFET;bootstrap circuits;junction gate field effect transistors;power convertors;printed circuits;silicon compounds","BOM;JFET-based switch;MOSFET devices;PCB;SiC;board space reduction;bootstrap operation;high-voltage junction FET transistors;power converters;power factor correctors;solar panels;supervision circuitry;voltage regulator","","5","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the overwhelming digital content of a mobile platform, ideally, the RF components should be realized with topologies that allow for their seamless scaling into 22nm and 14nm CMOS technologies. The Power Amplifier (PA) remains one of the most challenging circuit blocks to implement in nanoscale CMOS due to the strict requirements for output power, efficiency and linearity imposed by wireless communication standards. The low breakdown voltage of nanoscale MOSFETs limits the maximum drain voltage swing and the maximum achievable output power. In order to circumvent this problem, a typical approach is to increase the device size and use a reactive matching network to transform the load resistance to a value significantly lower than 50Ω. Nevertheless, due to the typically low-Q passive components that can be manufactured in a nanoscale CMOS process, and because of the high impedance transformation ratio involved, most of the additional output power that would be gained by increasing the device size is wasted in resistive losses in the matching networks, resulting in poor efficiency. This problem is exacerbated at mm-Wave frequencies where the loss of the passive components is even higher, and using lower f<sub>T</sub>/f<sub>MAX</sub> thicker oxide or extended drain MOS devices [1] is not viable.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176882","","CMOS integrated circuits;Inverters;Logic gates;MOSFETs;Power amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits;power amplifiers;radio transceivers;silicon-on-insulator","RF components;SOI CMOS class-D mm-wave PA;breakdown voltage;deeply-scaled silicon technologies;differential swing;low-Q passive components;low-cost portable communication devices;maximum achievable output power;maximum drain voltage swing;mobile platform;nanoscale CMOS process;nanoscale MOSFET;power amplifier;reactive matching network;size 45 nm;wireless communication standards;wireless transceivers","","9","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A 2.4GHz sub-harmonically injection-locked PLL with self-calibrated injection timing","Yi-Chieh Huang; Shen-Iuan Liu","Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2012 IEEE International","20120403","2012","","","338","340","A low-phase-noise integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL) is attractive in many applications, such as clock generation and analog-to-digital conversion. The sub-harmonically injection-locked technique, sub-sampling technique, and the multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) can significantly improve the phase noise of an integer-N PLL. In the sub-harmonically injection-locked technique, to inject a low-frequency reference clock into a high-frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the injection timing should be tightly controlled. If the injection timing varies due to process variation, it may cause a large reference spur or even cause the PLL to fails to lock. A sub-harmonically injection-locked PLL (SILPLL) adopts a sub-sampling phase-detector (PD) to automatically align the phase between the injection pulse and a VCO. However, a sub-sampling PD has a small capture range and a low bandwidth. The high-frequency non-linear effects of a sub-sampling PD may degrade the accuracy and limit the maximum speed of a VCO. In addition, a frequency-locked loop is needed for a sub-sampling PD. A delay line is manually adjusted to achieve the correct injection timing. However, the delay line is sensitive to process variations. Thus, the injection timing should be calibrated.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177037","","Jitter;Noise measurement;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement;Phase noise;Pulse generation;Timing","clocks;frequency locked loops;phase detectors;phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","analog-to-digital conversion;clock generation;delay line;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency-locked loop;injection timing calibration;low-phase-noise integer-N phase-locked loop;multiplying delay-locked loop;phase noise;reference clock;self-calibrated injection timing;sub-sampling technique;subharmonically injection-locked PLL;subharmonically injection-locked technique;subsampling phase-detector;voltage-controlled oscillator","","11","2","9","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The vital function of the gate driver is to provide an isolated gate signal against the reference source voltage that operates at high voltage. In addition to this function, their integration with GaN power HFETs is also desirable to achieve smaller system size, lower cost and user-friendliness. Although there are several signal isolation techniques for a gate driver such as to use a photo-coupler and wireless pulse transformer [2], these techniques have disadvantages such as large system size and difficulty in integration. Other bootstrap or charge pump techniques [3] in high voltage gate drivers (HVIC) have been developed to generate a reference voltage, but the driver can only be used in particular applications such as inverters. Meanwhile, we have focused our attention on the recent technology of wireless power transmission using an electromagnetic resonant coupler (EMRC) [4] with an open-ring resonator [5], which is very attractive due to its high efficiency in power transmission and its compactness at high frequency.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177066","","Gallium nitride;HEMTs;Integrated circuits;Logic gates;MODFETs;Substrates;Switches","III-V semiconductors;bootstrap circuits;carrier transmission on power lines;charge pump circuits;driver circuits;electric connectors;gallium compounds;high-voltage techniques;microprocessor chips;microwave integrated circuits;microwave resonators;power HEMT;power semiconductor switches;pulse width modulation;radio networks;wide band gap semiconductors","DC-isolated gate drive IC;HVIC;Si power devices;bootstrap techniques;charge pump techniques;drive-by-microwave technology;electromagnetic resonant coupler;heterojunction field-effect transistors;high power applications;high voltage gate drivers;isolated gate signal;open-ring resonator;outstanding GaN-based HFET power devices;power switching device;pulse width modulation signal;reference source voltage;signal isolation techniques;user-friendliness;wireless power transmission","","10","1","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For stimulation, most EA systems use a pair of needles with long, thick wires connected to an external power supply to form a closed current loop. The thin (φ=2mm) needle may suffer from the inconvenient and unstable connection to the thick wire and if there are many needles, it is difficult to supply power to all needles [4]. Recently, a wirelessly-powered EA system was proposed in [4] to remove the wire connections for convenient treatment, but its wireless power harvesting generated only 8μW which is not enough for various applications [1-3]. Most EA systems use bi-phase stimulation to reduce tissue damage, electrolysis, and electrolytic degradation [5].

To prevent VCO pulling by the PA, fractional dividers can be used to offset the VCO frequency (f<sub>VCO</sub>) with respect to the PA. Multistandard radios covering, for example, WiFi 2.4 to 2.5GHz and 5 to 5.8GHz, and WiMAX 2.3 to 2.7GHz and 3.3 to 3.8GHz, may require multiple VCOs and/or multiple fractional dividers to cover all bands [1], resulting in complexity and area overhead. This paper proposes a versatile reconfigurable fractional divider capable of covering the above standards with a single VCO with 20% tuning range. The divider is all-digital, hence scaling-friendly, and uses digital calibration to eliminate the need for filtering and area-intensive inductors. The versatility afforded by the reconfigurable fractional divider allows for the transceiver's LO generation (LOG) frequency plan to be adjusted on-the-fly. This can avoid VCO pulling from interferers which may not be known a-priori, like SoC-CPU clocks that are adjusted dynamically for best performance.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177048","","Calibration;Delay;Frequency conversion;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Transceivers;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS digital integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;UHF oscillators;calibration;frequency dividers;interference;phase locked loops;radio transceivers;system-on-chip;voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS all-digital reconfigurable fractional frequency divider;PLL;SoC-CPU clock;VCO;area-intensive inductor;digital calibration;filtering elimination;frequency 2.3 GHz to 2.7 GHz;frequency 3.3 GHz to 3.8 GHz;frequency 5 GHz to 5.8 GHz;multiple fractional dividers;multistandard SoC radio system;on-chip PA;on-the-fly interference management;radio circuitry;size 32 nm;transceiver LO generation frequency plan;transceiver LOG frequency plan;wireless transceiver","","8","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reconfigurability can be used to reduce their size, provided that power consumption is not adversely affected. For 2G/3G transceivers, local oscillator (LO) generation requires significant area and power. Reconfigurable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are generally used to maximize the achievable tuning range to reduce their number in the presence of many supported bands. However, no VCO capable to support both WCDMA and GSM has been reported that is also competitive with the power consumption achieved using two separate oscillators. In fact, the very demanding GSM phase-noise specs require a current up to four times higher (depending on the duplexer selectivity) than that used in the WCDMA case. In the design of an LC-tank harmonic oscillator, phase noise normalized to power consumption (i.e. the figure-of-merit, FOM), reaches an optimum at the maximum oscillation amplitude compatible with the supply voltage V<sub>dd</sub>. This condition impairs the power reconfigurability of a VCO, since there is only one value of bias current yielding the highest FOM, once tank and V<sub>dd</sub> are chosen. On the other hand, making the tank reconfigurable invariably results in a degradation of its Q, i.e. a reduced FOM.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177040","","Frequency synthesizers;Logic gates;Phase noise;Solid state circuits;Tuning;Voltage-controlled oscillators","cellular radio;code division multiple access;frequency synthesizers;radio transceivers;smart phones;voltage-controlled oscillators","2G transceiver;3G transceiver;CMOS;GSM frequency synthesizer;LC-tank harmonic oscillator design;RF front-end;WCDMA frequency synthesizer;digitally controlled oscillator;duplexer selectivity;local oscillator generation;phase noise normalization;power 36 mW;power 9 mW;power consumption;reconfigurable voltage-controlled oscillator;size 55 nm;smart phone","","8","","3","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The desire for wide voltage range operation to optimize power and performance dictates the need for SRAM arrays that can achieve both high performance and low minimum voltage of operation (V<sub>MIN</sub>). The 8T bitcell is commonly used in these applications because its decoupled read and write ports offer fast read (RD) and write (WR) operations with generally lower V<sub>MIN</sub> than the 6T bitcell. However, process variations result in mismatches between the pull-up and access devices limiting write V<sub>MIN</sub>, and/or between read port and keeper transistors limiting read V<sub>MIN</sub>. Traditional device up-sizing provides diminishing returns at a large area and power cost. In addition to cell upsizing, dynamic assist techniques have been used for V<sub>MIN</sub> reduction in 6T and 8T arrays - examples include temporary collapse of bitcell voltage for write V<sub>MIN</sub> reduction and boosting read and write wordlines requiring careful design of the embedded charge pump and the level shifters. In contrast, this paper describes a new capacitive-coupling (CC) write wordline boost which employs intrinsic coupling capacitance between write bitlines (WBL) and accessed write wordline (WWL) to boost WWL without the need for a charge pump or complex level shifters. The scheme has a built-in self-induced V<sub>CC</sub> collapse (SIC) allowing the cell voltage to partially collapse during the write operation, further improving write V<sub>MIN</sub>. The technique is implemented in a 12KB, 8T cell macro with cell area of 0.238μm<sup>2</sup>, fabricated in a 22nm CMOS technology.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176990","","Arrays;Boosting;Capacitance;Couplings;Delay;Random access memory;Silicon carbide","CMOS digital integrated circuits;SRAM chips;cache storage;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip","CMOS technology;SRAM;SoC;access device;capacitive-coupling wordline boosting;capacitive-coupling write wordline boost;cell upsizing;dynamic assist technique;embedded charge pump;embedded memory array;high-performance microprocessor;intrinsic coupling capacitance;keeper transistor;level shifter;low-level cache;memory size 8 TByte;pull-up device;read operation;read port;register file;size 22 nm;wide voltage range operation;write bitline;write operation","","3","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In NTC, cores are operated near the threshold voltage (~200mV above Vth) to optimally balance power and performance [1]. In Centip3De, we operate cores at 650mV, as opposed to the wear-out limited supply voltage of 1.5V. This improves measured energy efficiency by 5.1×.

Good audio quality is a prerequisite and mW-range power consumption is compulsory in view of battery size. However, the GHz communication channel typically shows a significant attenuation; for an ear-to-ear link, the attenuation due to the narrowband fade dominates and is in the order of 55 to 65dB [1]. The typically small antennas, close to the human body, add another 10 to 15dB of losses.

Digital processors are typically implemented in the latest CMOS process to take advantage of the increased density and performance afforded by CMOS scaling. Integration of traditional RF circuits, however, requires accurate RF and passive models that typically lag behind digital transistor models by several quarters. This makes RF integration the limiting factor for time-to-market for the whole SoC, or results in sub-optimal multiple-chip solutions. Furthermore, traditional RF circuits do not benefit from scaling as digital circuits do, e.g. due to extensive use of inductors, the ever-lowering supply voltage, etc. This work presents a digital WiFi transmitter (TX) implemented in a 32nm digital CMOS process to address these issues. An outphasing architecture allows implementation of both amplitude and phase modulation using scaling-friendly, delay-based, switching phase modulators. The integrated PA was already shown to be possible to design with no RF models [1]; known issues of outphasing PA design (e.g. output impedance modulation, linearity, efficiency) are also addressed in [1]. The phase modulator uses an open-loop architecture to accommodate OFDM bandwidths up to 40MHz. The TX achieves state-of-the-art performance already in 32nm and is moreover expected to: (1) improve with scaling and (2) port easily over successive process nodes.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176962","","CMOS integrated circuits;Computer architecture;Delay;Phase modulation;Radio transmitters;System-on-a-chip","CMOS digital integrated circuits;radio transmitters;radiofrequency integrated circuits;system-on-chip;wireless LAN","CMOS scaling;OFDM bandwidths;RF circuits;RF integration;RF models;WLAN application;amplitude modulation;application processors;digital CMOS process;digital WiFi transmitter;digital baseband;digital circuits;digital outphasing transmitter;digital processors;digital transistor models;form-factor reasons;frequency 2.4 GHz;open-loop architecture;outphasing architecture;passive models;phase modulation;process nodes;size 32 nm;sub-optimal multiple-chip solutions;switching phase modulators;system-on-chip","","3","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, OFDM modulation in LTE20 creates up to 100 Resource Blocks (RB) each containing 12 subcarriers with 15kHz spacing, spread over the channel bandwidth. For an RB with frequency offset f<sub>s</sub> from the LO, transmitter non-linearity causes counter-intermodulation (CIM) products at -3f<sub>s</sub>, +5f<sub>s</sub>, -7f<sub>s</sub>, ... from the LO. These spurious signals directly, or through remixing due to PA non-linearity, may fall on other bands. The worst case is when one or just a few RBs are transmitted at the edge of the channel. The CIM effect, specific to 4G signals, makes the design of multimode transmitters more challenging since such transmitters also need to meet the substantially different 2G and 3G requirements. Previous works on LTE have mainly focused on the stringent RX-band noise and ACLR requirements for SAW-less transmitter design without discussing the CIM performance [1]. CIM terms are first generated by mixers. A drive amplifier (DA) placed after the mixers will cause these terms to be regenerated due to high-level harmonic sidebands. DA noise contribution can also be significant, especially at low output power. If current-mode mixers are employed, the use of a differential DA may be prohibitive due to large power consumption [2]. A transmitter without DA avoids these problems while it helps reduce die area and power consumption. This paper describes a multi-mode multiband DA-less transmitter which meets the counter-intermodulation and RX-band noise requirements for SAW-less operation for 2G, 3G and 4G standards while avoiding excessive power consumption, as reported in [3,4].","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176960","","Computer integrated manufacturing;Impedance matching;Mixers;Noise;Power generation;Radio frequency;Transmitters","4G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;OFDM modulation;mixers (circuits);power amplifiers;radio transmitters;radiofrequency amplifiers","ACLR;Long Term Evolution;OFDM modulation;SAW-less transmitter;counter-intermodulation products;current-mode mixers;driver amplifier;fourth-generation mobile devices;multiband multimode transmitter;resource blocks;transmitter nonlinearity","","21","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They exhibit inherent noise-shaping properties and can operate at low supply voltages and high sampling rates [1-3]. However, usage of VCO-based ADCs has been limited due to their nonlinear voltage-to-frequency (V-to-F) transfer characteristic, which severely degrades their distortion performance. Digital calibration is used to combat nonlinearity in an open-loop VCO-based ADC, but 1<sup>st</sup>-order noise-shaping mandates high OSRs, thus increasing power dissipation in digital circuits, even in a nanometer-scale CMOS process [1]. In [2], nonlinearity is suppressed by embedding the VCO in a ΔΣ loop. While this technique works in principle, the need for large loop gain at high frequencies makes it very difficult to achieve high SNDR. For instance, the suppression level near the band edge is approximately 20dB for a VCO-based 2<sup>nd</sup>-order modulator operating with an over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 30. Our ADC overcomes the impact of VCO non-linearity by minimizing the input signal processed by the VCO.

Especially, low-power efficiency enhancement (LPEE) techniques, considering the probability distribution function of the practical wireless communication environments, extend the battery lifetime in handheld devices. Therefore, there are many studies for the LPEE in handheld CMOS PAs using transmission-line transformers (TLTs) with parallel amplifiers. Designing a series/parallel-combining transformer (SCT/PCT) is one of the key factors in the implementation of a dual-mode CMOS PA. However, the dual-mode performances of the PA must be optimized by using one output TLT structure. It is expected that there are difficulties in designing a highly efficient dual-mode PA. Therefore, this paper introduces a fully integrated dual-mode CMOS PA with a proposed output TLT with 2 control switches, which allows an LPEE with a back-off region of 10dB or more with a very low quiescent current.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176939","","CMOS integrated circuits;Impedance;Impedance matching;Logic gates;Power amplifiers;Power generation;Radio frequency","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;UHF power amplifiers;code division multiple access;radio transceivers;statistical distributions;transformers","WCDMA;battery lifetime;frequency 1.95 GHz;fully integrated dual-mode CMOS power amplifier;handheld devices;low-power efficiency enhancement techniques;parallel amplifiers;probability distribution function;quiescent current;radio front-ends;series-parallel-combining transformer;single-chip transceiver;transmission-line transformers;wireless communication environments","","27","1","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventionally, this phase shift is controlled by the baseband with exhaustive tuning algorithms resulting in very long tuning time as the beam direction is changed, which grows exponentially with the number of elements used.

"A high-stability emulated absolute current hysteretic control single-inductor 5-output switching DC-DC converter with energy sharing and balancing","Se-Won Wang; Gyu-Ha Cho; Gyu-Hyeong Cho","KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2012 IEEE International","20120403","2012","","","276","278","Several types of DC-DC converters for active-matrix organic LED (AMOLED) displays have been introduced to date [1-4]. Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters with current-mode control have many advantages including reduced PCB space and less cost for mass-production due to the use of only one off-chip inductor to provide many outputs [1,2]. However, a load-dependent stability issue has to be addressed which is due to the output capacitance and an internal integrator with an error amplifier. Recently, in efforts to overcome the stability issue of current-mode control, load-independent control converters have been developed. Although this concept works well, the inductor-current sensing and artificial ramp generation for stability still make the controller complicated [3,4]. In addition, the freewheeling current control converter requires an extra power switch for freewheeling current flow, thereby lowering power efficiency [3]. The vestigial current control converter, meanwhile, has weak points of requiring auxiliary output and an additional inductor, and thus consumes some additional power in the steady state [4]. Besides the controller issue, the previous converters when operating with a large step-up ratio, usually have heavy voltage stress applied to the inductor, resulting in a low efficiency [1,4]. To overcome these problems, the proposed SIMO converter employs emulated absolute current hysteretic control, which uses full current information and is characterized by intrinsic high stability. The energy sharing capacitor is also used for high output voltage to reduce the voltage swing of the switching node and the associated loss. In addition, to balance the total energy across the inductor, the energy balancing capacitor is adopted.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177002","","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Capacitors;Current control;Inductors;Switches;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;LED displays;capacitors;electric current control;inductors;stability","AMOLED;SIMO converter;active-matrix organic LED displays;artificial ramp generation;energy balancing capacitor;energy sharing;error amplifier;high-stability emulated absolute current hysteretic control;inductor-current sensing;internal integrator;load-independent control converters;mass-production;single-inductor 5-output switching DC-DC converter;single-inductor multiple-output converters","","3","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The binary BCH code is widely used for the SSD due to its powerful error-correction capability. As it is hard to achieve high-throughput strong BCH decoders [4-5], multiple BCH decoders are typically on a high-performance SSD controller, leading to a significant increase of hardware complexity. This paper presents an efficient BCH encoder/decoder architecture achieving a decoding throughput of 6Gb/s.

Energy efficiency can be increased by per-core dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and by employing a globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS) system architecture in which distribution of a synchronous high-speed clock is not required. For global on-chip communication this presents major challenges due to the need for reliable data synchronization, high bandwidth requirements and speed limiting RC effects on long wires. It has been shown recently that low-swing differential on-chip links provide highest bandwidth, low energy-per-bit and uninterrupted transfers over lengths up to 10mm [1-3, 6]. Capacitively-driven links are promising because of their built-in pre-emphasis thereby countervailing the low-pass behavior of long on-chip wires [1, 4-5]. However, all of these existing implementations focus mainly on the transmission line itself. The capacitively-driven links are not able to forward a stoppable clock signal as there is no well defined differential DC level on the wires with no data or clock activity. In addition, clocking is not reported [5] or fully synchronous, which means a high-speed clock must be distributed globally on-chip. This work provides a solution for capacitively-driven links with a parallel DC resistive divider to allow forwarded clocking with complete gating capability.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176902","","Capacitance;Clocks;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic gates;Synchronization;System-on-a-chip;Transmission line measurements","CMOS integrated circuits;asynchronous circuits;clocks;dividing circuits;system-on-chip","CMOS;DVFS;GALS system architecture;bit rate 90 Gbit/s;capacitively-driven links;dynamic voltage frequency scaling;energy efficiency;forwarded clocking;gating capability;globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous system architecture;parallel DC resistive divider;size 65 nm;source-synchronous capacitively driven serial on-chip link","","8","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Switched-inductor integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) can enable effective implementation of DVFS, eliminating the need for separate VRMs and reducing power distribution network (PDN) impedance requirements by performing dc-dc conversion close to the load while supporting high peak current densities [2-3].

In addition, these Razor techniques introduce significant hold time constraints that are difficult to meet given worsening timing variability. To address these two issues we propose Bubble Razor (B-Razor), which uses a novel error-detection technique based on two-phase latch timing and a local replay mechanism that can be inserted automatically in any design. The error detec tion technique breaks the dependency between minimum delay and speculation window, restoring hold-time constraints to conventional values and allowing timing speculation of up to 100% of nominal delay. The large timing specula tion makes Bubble Razor especially applicable to low-voltage designs where tim ing variation grows exponentially.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177103","","Clocks;Delay;Flip-flops;Latches;Logic gates;Random access memory","delay circuits;error correction;error detection;flip-flops;low-power electronics;timing circuits","B-Razor;architectural invasiveness;architectural replay;architecture-independent approach;bubble razor;commercial processor;error-detection technique;flip-flops;hold time constraints;hold-time constraints;late arriving signals;local replay mechanism;low-voltage designs;minimum delay;nominal delay;razor techniques;razor-style systems;speculation window;timing margins;timing speculation;timing variation;timing-error correction;timing-error detection;transient delay errors;two-phase latch timing;worsening timing variability","","16","","6","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, the memory interface has been improved up to 20Gb/s/link [1]. Considering PCB routing area, a multi-drop bus architecture is still preferable for large memory capacity to the point-to-point connection. However, the multi-drop approach suffers from performance degradations due to reflections at each stub. To mitigate this problem, reference [2] proposes an impedance-matched bidirectional multi-drop DQ bus architecture that is difficult to realize due to smaller series resistor if more than 4 modules are used. To avoid multi-reflections from each stub, other approaches have used coupled transmission lines (CTL) [3, 4]. While a horizontal directional coupler buried in the PCB was used [3], coupled traces on the bent loop of flex fixed to a module were used for signal delivery in vertical direction [4]. In [3], a long coupler with long main bus line was used so that the signal integrity degrades at the far-end coupler.

DVB-T, DVB-C, ATSC-A/74 as well as cable modems (DOCSIS) and analog TV require low-noise, high-linearity front-ends with high-performance local oscillators. Integrability and cost dictate minimization of external components. Unlike common approaches the silicon tuner presented in this paper features one single-ended RF input for the entire 40MHz-to-1GHz band, requires no external SAW filters or balun, and supports channel bandwidths from 5 to 8MHz. The analog IF output is programmable from 5MHz to 44MHz, supporting both modern digital demodulators and legacy analog demodulators. The receiver uses a low-IF architecture and is able to process the broadband input spectrum through the combination of a low-noise programmable RF filter, a digitally calibrated harmonic-rejection mixer, and a wide dynamic range ADC, whose intrinsic filtering nature and large SNDR make the tuner compatible with the very demanding ATSC A/74 standard. The chip's sophisticated digital back-end provides channel filtering and image rejection for the signal path, runs the RF and IF AGCs, and controls a variety of calibration schemes used to improve performance and robustness toward PVT variations. The chip has been designed in a scaled 90nm CMOS technology, requires a 1.8V analog supply and a 1.0V digital supply, and dissipates <;450mW during normal operation and <;10mW in standby mode. The BoM is limited to a single LNA bias inductor and a 40MHz crystal, thus minimizing the required footprint and cost.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176959","","CMOS integrated circuits;Calibration;Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Power harmonic filters;Radio frequency;Tuners","CMOS integrated circuits;calibration;circuit tuning;demodulators;elemental semiconductors;filtering theory;silicon;software radio;television equipment","ATSC A/74 standard;CMOS technology;DVB-C;DVB-T;PVT variations;SAW filters;Si;analog TV;balun;bandwidth 5 MHz to 8 MHz;broadband input spectrum;cable modems;channel filtering;chip sophisticated digital back-end;digital demodulators;digitally calibrated harmonic-rejection mixer;dynamic range ADC;frequency 40 MHz to 1 GHz;fully integrated multistandard silicon tuner;high-performance local oscillators;image rejection;legacy analog demodulators;low-IF architecture;low-noise high-linearity front-ends;low-noise programmable RF filter;signal path;single LNA bias inductor;size 80 nm;software-defined-radio paradigm;voltage 1.0 V;voltage 1.8 V","","5","","7","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It also has the advantage of miniaturization for point-of-care (PoC) or on-site sensing applications, unlike the 3-electrode topology in electrochemical sensors [3]. Several studies have proposed capacitive biosensors that utilize a nonfaradaic process, which refers to transient currents charging a geometrical capacitor in an electrolyte-electrode interface [4]. Conventional capacitive biosensors using the excitation of the bidirectional current [5,6] can be implemented with a compact design, but they have several issues that degrade the sensitivity of the sensor, such as DC drift in the electrode caused by a charge imbalance, the electrolysis generated by DC voltage across the electrodes, the offset generated by pre-charged initial values, and weakness against common-mode noise.

This 16-core processor has 3 key features: (1) A cluster-based hierarchical architecture supporting both shared-memory and message-passing communication. (2) A cache-free memory hierarchy with an extended register file, small private memory and moderate shared memory to avoid complex cache coherence issues and achieve high energy efficiency by keeping data accesses local. (3) A hardware-aided mailbox mechanism to accelerate the synchronization procedure between different processor nodes.

For instance, a fast file transfer by “touch-and-proceed data communication” provides a user-friendly interface for electronic products [1,2]. Wireless I/O's may replace conventional connectors on a PCB to overcome performance limitations [3,4]. High-speed (>;Gb/s), low energy dissipation (<;100pJ/b), low bit-error-rate (BER<;10<sup>-3</sup>), and low cost (small layout area in matured CMOS processes) are required as well as compliance with spectral regulation and EMI/EMS. None of the previous research achievements has satisfied all these requirements (Fig. 26.2.6). Non-coherent UWB transceivers are typically low speed and energy hungry; i.e. 15Mb/s with 2680pJ/b in a heterodyne transceiver [1] and 1Mb/s with 373pJ/b in a direct-conversion transceiver [3]. Millimeter-Wave radio is often used to raise the data rate at the cost of increase in energy dissipation. A heterodyne non-coherent 60GHz transceiver performed 2.5Gb/s with 114pJ/b [2]. To further reduce the energy dissipation a direct-conversion coherent 56GHz transceiver was developed in 40nm CMOS and 11Gb/s was achieved with 6.4pJ/b [4]. Unfortunately, as a free-running TX LO and injection-lock carrier synchronization were employed, the injection locking range was very narrow. For an RF input power of -30dBm, the locking range was 60MHz, only 0.1% of the center frequency. Tight control of frequency under variation and noise is not easy for manufacturing. Raising the RF input power is also limited by the FCC spectral mask regulation. In this paper, we present a UWB direct-conversion coherent transceiver in 90nm CMOS. 2Gb/s with 75pJ/b is achieved while meeting the FCC regulation for indoor communications. An IQ-switching carrier recovery scheme is proposed to save layout area and energy dissipation by 43% and 20%, respectively, compared with those in the conventional Costas loop. The transceiver - ith the proposed carrier recovery scheme uses binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177082","","Energy dissipation;Hysteresis;Receivers;Switches;Training;Transceivers;Wireless communication","CMOS integrated circuits;phase shift keying;radio transceivers;radiocommunication;ultra wideband technology","BER;BPSK;CMOS;Costas loop;EMI;EMS;IQ-switching carrier recovery scheme;PCB;UWB direct-conversion coherent transceiver;binary phase shift keying;bit rate 11 Gbit/s;bit rate 15 Mbit/s;bit rate 2 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s;bit-error-rate;direct-conversion transceiver;electronic products;energy dissipation;frequency 56 GHz;frequency 60 GHz;frequency 60 MHz;injection-lock carrier synchronization;millimeter-wave radio;power 150 mW;short-distance wireless communications;size 40 nm;touch-and-proceed data communication;wavelength 90 nm;wireless I/O","","2","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Ivy Bridge architecture is derived from the second-generation Intel Core™ processor. The processor has about 1.4 billion transistors in about 160mm2 in its largest incarnation. It introduces several enhancements in power, performance, and features over its predecessor. The IA core adds a pipelined divider, a next page prefetcher, additions to the ISA for 16b floating point conversion, fast string moves, and fast access of the FS/GS base registers. The Graphics/Media block provides significantly improved performance along with DX11 API support. Further, display capabilities have been augmented with a third independent display pipeline. The on-die power management control unit (PCU) and its associated firmware have added several power and thermal optimizations to improve performance and yield within the existing platform power envelopes, as well as to improve idle power relative to its predecessor. Power gates are distributed throughout the cores, enabling the PCU to independently either reduce voltage to a state retention voltage, or turn off voltage to a given core, depending on the current core usage conditions. The processor also implements power gating for portions of the DDR I/O buffers, reducing CPU power consumption when memory is in ""self-refresh"" mode. To optimize core sleep time, Ivy Bridge incorporates smart interrupt routing logic, which sends interrupts to active cores. The PCU also analyzes the processor's inherent voltage-frequency dependency to determine the optimum operating voltages across the entire dynamic range of operation.

In, an ADC with both flexible resolution and sample rate is reported; however, its power efficiency is not as good as the point-solutions in. This paper describes a SAR ADC that achieves both good power efficiency (6.5-to-16fJ/conversion-step) and a wide range of flexibility (7-to-10b resolution, sample rates up to 4MS/s) to cover a large variety of applications, thereby reducing cost, design-time and overall complexity. To optimize the power efficiency for each resolution, both the DAC and comparator are reconfigurable.

Specifically, CD encodes two bits of data over four binary wires in such a way that post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) is completely eliminated across the entire unit-interval (UI). CD signaling is NRZ on individual wires and is balanced across the bus, meaning over any UI half the four-wire set have a high signaling level while the other half have a low level. The balanced nature of signaling leads to low supply switching noise. Received data is detected differentially by discriminating the difference between the signals on wire pairs without the need for a fixed reference voltage.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176953","","Clocks;Decoding;Latches;Multiplexing;Prototypes;Receivers;Wires","decision feedback equalisers;interference suppression;intersymbol interference","1-tap decision feedback equalization;CD signaling;ISI mitigation;NRZ;UI;bit rate 16 Gbit/s;coded differential bidirectional parallel electrical link;coded differential signaling;four-wire set;high-speed parallel electrical links;low supply switching noise;post-cursor intersymbol interference;unit-interval","","1","","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, in harmonic imaging, a well-established method resulting in enhanced contrast, higher harmonic echoes (usually the second) of the fundamental transmitted frequency, either generated by reflection from micro-bubbles or on propagation, are selectively detected and used for imaging [1]. As a consequence, the second harmonic of the transmitted signal is suppressed as much as possible and the received signal is derived solely from the nonlinear behavior of the body. Pulsers are usually adopted having high efficiency, being simple and lending themselves to harmonic imaging for example by means of out-of-phase pulse transmission techniques [1]. Output signals with arbitrary shape allow better performances, enabling apodization profiles with high resolution, beams with low harmonic content and instantaneous changes in transmit energy between pulses [2]. However, the implementation of arbitrary waveform generators in commercial solutions is presently limited to high-end systems because of manufacturing costs, power dissipation and space constraints. To this extent, the availability of an adequate IC technology such as BCD, handling high dynamic range signals at high frequency and capable of multi-watt level driving, opens up to the investigation of integrated amplifier topologies [3]. Advantages in terms of EM interference reduction, reliability improvement, space and cost would derive. Achieving adequate gain-bandwidth products is nonetheless challenging considering the limited f<sub>T</sub> of high voltage devices.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177054","","Harmonic analysis;Harmonic distortion;Imaging;Impedance;Power amplifiers;Ultrasonic imaging;Voltage measurement","power amplifiers;ultrasonic imaging","BCD6-SOI;EM interference reduction;GBW linear power amplifier;apodization profiles;frequency 720 MHz;harmonic imaging;integrated amplifier topologies;pulse transmission technique;reliability improvement;transducer drivers;ultrasound imaging transmitters;waveform generators","","4","","4","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If radios operate in close proximity, blockers as strong as 0dBm may occur, driving almost any receiver in compression (note that 0dBm in 50Ω corresponds to a peak-to-peak voltage of half a 1.2V supply). Thus RF blocker filtering is highly wanted. However, fixed filters are undesired when aiming for multiband, software-defined or cognitive radio transceivers. Passive LC filters show limited Q and tunability. Recently frequency translated filtering has been proposed as a potential solution direction for high-Q filtering. We showed that by applying the “N-path concept”, more than a decade of center frequency range with good linearity, compression point (P<sub>1dB</sub>>;0dBm, IIP3 >;14dBm) and low noise is feasible for a bandpass (BP) filter. A notch filter with a combination of active and passive mixers is applied in a feedforward path realizing a BP filter. The low input impedance of a transimpedance amplifier with feedback is upconverted to create a notch filter at low frequencies (80MHz) suppressing TX leakage in an FDD system. In this work we explore the possibility to realize a notch filter applying the N-path concept at RF frequencies and in a completely passive way. A single-ended (SE) and a differential 8-path notch filter with passive frequency mixing are presented. The filters are power-matched in the input and output in the passband and provide a low insertion loss, high compression point and also low noise property, thus they can be utilized in front of a receiver to provide rejection of high-power blockers with a large frequency tuning range.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176936","","Band pass filters;Harmonic analysis;Passband;Power harmonic filters;RLC circuits;Receivers;Resonator filters","band-pass filters;cognitive radio;mixers (circuits);notch filters;operational amplifiers;passive filters;radiofrequency filters;software radio","8-path tunable RF notch filter;N-path concept;RF blocker filtering;active mixer;bandpass filter;blocker suppression;cognitive radio transceiver;differential 8-path notch filter;fixed filter;frequency 80 MHz;frequency translated filtering;high-Q filtering;multiband radio transceiver;passive LC filter;passive frequency mixing;passive mixer;resistance 50 ohm;single-ended notch filter;software-defined radio transceiver;transimpedance amplifier;voltage 1.2 V;wireless device","","14","1","8","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To lower cost and increase integration, MOSFETs in CMOS are being investigated for implementing broadband detectors [1-3]. However, neither measured noise-equivalent power (NEP) nor noise floor of the imager was given in [1]. Although NEP of 17pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> was achieved at 650GHz in [2], an external lens was attached to the 65nm SOI CMOS chip. In [3], an NEP of 66pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> was measured at 1.05THz using 65nm CMOS without a lens attached to the chip. Additionally, although the efforts reported in [1-3] realized an array, none demonstrated the image-array function. As an alternative, polysilicon-gate-separation (PGS) Schottky-barrier diodes (SBD) with cut-off frequency of ~2THz were fabricated in CMOS without process modifications [4] and were used to demonstrate a 280GHz detector with NEP of 30pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> [5,6]. To significantly enhance the scanning speed, a 16-pixel 280GHz SBD imager is fabricated and its array function is reported in this paper. The imager including baseband amplifiers achieves responsivity of 5.1kV/W and NEP of 29pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup>. More importantly, its operation was demonstrated in a setup that requires no mirror or lens that is bulky and costly. Next, an 860GHz SBD detector is demonstrated with a measured non-amplified responsivity of 355V/W and NEP of 32pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup>. This NEP is ~2X lower than the best reported work in CMOS [3].

The classical BGVR generates a reference voltage that is slightly larger than the material bandgap: a little above 1200mV in silicon. For deep-sub-micron technologies the supply voltage is about the same as the material bandgap which prevents using the classical bandgap structure. As a solution a number of BGVR topologies that create a sub-1V are invented; most of them are based on the structure introduced by Banba [1], some are using resistive voltage division [2] or voltage averaging [3]. For low-power operation high-ohmic resistors (occupying a large area!) must be used in all these techniques, leading to an immediate trade-off between power consumption and chip-area. This trade-off prevents the local generation of reference voltages where they are required: either the power penalty or the area penalty would be too significant.

Moreover, HD resolution has become so universal today that even smartphones support applications with HD resolution. However, many object recognition processors and accelerators reported for mobile applications only support SD resolution due to the computational complexity of object recognition algorithms.

From pre vious analyses, the Transmission-Gate Pulsed Latch (TGPL) proved to be the most energy-efficient FF in a large portion of the design space, ranging from high speed (minimizing ED' products with j>;1) to minimum ED product designs, while simple Master-Slave FFs (TGFF and ACFF ) are the most energy-efficient in the low-power E-D space region. TGPL also has the lowest D Q delay along with STFF. However, the latter has considerably worse energy efficiency, hence, the TGPL is the best reference for a comparison. In this work, two new FFs are introduced, the Conditional Push-Pull Pulsed Latch (CP3L), and a version with a Shareable (CSP3L) Pulse Generator (PG). The adoption of a fast push-pull second stage, which requires a conditional PG, enables 50-to-100% delay improvements compared to TGPL, and absolute D-Q up to 0.7FO4. CP3L and CSP3L also exhibit superior energy efficiency to TGPL in terms of minimum ED3 and ED products. A test chip is fabricated in 65nm CMOS technology (VDD=1V) to measure delay and energy consumption of CP3L, CSP3L and TGPL in minimum ED and ED3 sizings.

A recent circuit tackles this problem by dispensing with the LNA entirely. This mixer-first approach achieves impressive linearity, but at the expense of noise figure and, since such a receiver has no gain prior to down-conversion, the flicker noise corner can be unacceptably high. Other SDR attempts invariably use a noise-cancelling LNA at the front end, which provides wideband matching, however such approaches have either inadequate linearity or display too large a noise for our purposes. In this work, we propose a hybrid frequency-translational, noise-cancelling (FTNC) receiver that employs two separate down-conversion paths to enable noise cancelling with no voltage gain prior to base-band filtering. The resulting design has a sub-2dB noise figure and tolerates 0dBm blockers with no gain back-off, breaking the traditional noise-linearity trade-off common in all receivers.","0193-6530","978-1-4673-0376-7","","10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6176935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176935","","Mixers;Noise;Noise figure;Radio frequency;Receivers;Wideband","broadband networks;integrated circuit noise;interference suppression;microprocessor chips;radiofrequency filters;software radio","FTNC receiver;SDR receiver;base-band filtering;blocker-tolerant wideband noise-cancelling receiver;down-conversion path;hybrid frequency-translational noise-cancelling receiver;minimal gain compression;mixer-first approach;narrowband off-chip RF filtering;noise figure 2 dB;noise figure degradation;out-of-band blocker;software-defined radio","","34","3","5","","","19-23 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are typically implemented using either an opamp-RC or a G<sub>m</sub>-C architecture depending on bandwidth and linearity requirements. The performance of both these topologies depends on the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) used to implement the integrator. Reduced supply voltage and lower transistor output impedance make it difficult to implement high-gain wide-bandwidth OTAs in a power-efficient manner. Consequently, the DC gain of the integrator is often severely limited when designed in deep-submicron CMOS processes. Conventional integrators employ multi-stage OTAs operating in weak inversion and forward body biasing to achieve large DC gain at low supply voltages [1]. These techniques require automatic biasing to guarantee robust operation under all conditions and the use of frequency compensation combined with large dimensions needed to bias the transistors in weak inversion severely limits the bandwidth and increases power dissipation.

The most important consideration in implementing a wake-up receiver (WuRX) is low power dissipation while maximizing sensitivity. Because of this requirement of very low power, WuRX are usually designed by a simple RF envelope detector (RFED) consisting of Schottky diodes [1,3] or MOSFETs in the weak inversion region [2] without active filtering or amplification of the input signal. Therefore, the performance of the RFED itself is critical for attaining good sensitivity of the WuRX. Moreover, the poor filtering of the input signal renders the WuRX vulnerable to interferers from nearby terminals with high transmit power such as mobile phones and WiFi devices, and this can result in false wake-ups [1].

The continuing increase of network-connected devices risks depletion of IPv4 addresses. As for IPv6, the number of routing-table entries is about to reach 16k with a rapid annual growth rate of 90%. This growth trend will continue in the Internet-of-Things era. In growing network applications with large amounts of traffic, there is a demand for routers and switches capable of packet processing for applications such as forwarding, quality of service, classification and access control. Fully parallel ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) are the key devices to handle the large number of routes in the lookup table with high-throughput low-latency header processing [1-6]. Realizing both high-density (high-capacity) and high-speed search operation is a challenge due to high power consumption and diminishing signal integrity for search operations. Process scaling is important to achieve a high-density high-performance TCAM, but it incurs the decrease of operating margin caused by threshold-voltage variation. This paper presents a 400MHz 4-paralleled search-operation 80Mb TCAM test-chip in a 28nm process that can accommodate 1M entries. This chip has three key features: flexible search mode, row and column shift redundancy, and search omission with valid-bit. With flexible search mode, the TCAM can be adapted to both IPv4 and IPv6.","0193-6530","978-1-4799-0918-6","","10.1109/ISSCC.2014.6757417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757417","","Clocks;Computer aided manufacturing;Power demand;Power measurement;Redundancy;Sensors;Solid state circuits","CMOS memory circuits;IP networks;content-addressable storage;search problems;telecommunication network routing","4-paralleled search-operation 80Mb TCAM test-chip;IPv4 addresses;IPv4 routing table entries;IPv6;Internet-of-Things era;diminishing signal integrity;flexible search mode;frequency 400 MHz;fully parallel ternary content-addressable memories;header processing;high-capacity search operation;high-density search operation;high-speed search operation;lookup table;memory size 80 MByte;network-connected devices;operating margin decrease;power consumption;process scaling;routers;row and column shift redundancy;search omission;size 28 nm;switches","","1","","6","","","9-13 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2012 the US President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended sharing government spectrum from 2.7GHz to 3.7GHz for public use while advocating that future systems deliver significantly improved spectrum efficiency. Cognitive radio systems with multi-tiered shared spectrum access (MTSSA) are expected to deliver such superior efficiency over existing scheduled-access systems; they have 3 or more device tiers with different access privileges. Lower tiered `smart' devices opportunistically use the underutilized spectrum and need spectrum sensing for incumbent detection and interférer avoidance. Incumbent detection will rely on database lookup or narrowband high-sensitivity sensing. Integrated interférer detectors, on the other hand, need to be fast, wideband and energy efficient while only requiring moderate sensitivity. During designated slot boundaries (10s of us), they quickly detect the presence of a few (3 or so) large interferers over e.g., a 1GHz span (2.7 to 3.7GHz) with a 20MHz RBW (i.e. 50 bins) so that the carrier-aggregating receiver can be reconfigured on a frame (10s of ms) or even slot (100s of us) basis.","","978-1-4799-6223-5","","10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063069","","Baseband;Detectors;Energy efficiency;Radio frequency;Wideband","UHF radio propagation;analogue-digital conversion;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;interference suppression;microwave propagation;mobility management (mobile radio);radio spectrum management;telecommunication traffic","Integrated interferer detector;MTSSA;cognitive radio system;compressed sampling;database lookup;frequency 2.7 GHz to 3.7 GHz;government spectrum sharing;incumbent detection;interferer avoidance;mobile data traffic;multitiered shared spectrum access;narrowband high sensitivity sensing;quadrature analog-to-information converter;scheduled access system;smart devices;spectrum efficiency improvement;spectrum sensing;underutilized spectrum","","0","","","","","22-26 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article reviews such digital MOS circuits as they have been developed over the last 50 years, since the advent of integrated circuits (ICs). A particular emphasis is placed on MPUs, systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), and SRAMs and DRAMs; the discussion is based mainly on papers presented at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) and the Symposium on VLSI Circuits. Flash memories that necessitate unique circuits for high density rather than low power and high speed are excluded.","1943-0582","","","10.1109/MSSC.2012.2230833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449375","","CMOS integrated circuits;Computer architecture;Digital circuits;History;Low power electronics;MOSFETs;Microprocessors;Random access memory;System-on-a-chip;Voltage control","DRAM chips;MOS digital integrated circuits;SRAM chips;VLSI;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","DRAM;International Solid-State Circuits Conference;MOS large-scale integration;SRAM;Symposium on VLSI Circuits;flash memories;high-end microcomputers;integrated circuits;low-power low-voltage digital MOS circuits development;portable systems;systems-on-a-chip","","0","","","","","winter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
