Cells were cultured in the microwells, and different drugs were applied to the cells to modify cell cytoskeletons. Multi-spot, localized cytolysis with micron precision was carried out with the SFAT array. Experimental results show that the SFAT array produced localized cytolysis with a focal spot of about 100-300 microns in diameter in multiple microwells, and the changes of the acoustic intensity threshold (AIT) for cytolysis were in accord with the alterations of the cytoskeleton induced by the drug treatments. Therefore, cytoskeleton-specific fast drug screening can be realized by observing the variation of the AIT. Since the SFAT array can lyse multiple cell samples within 3 minutes, it is easy to discern the lysed cells under fluorescent microscope, and the SFAT array system improves the efficiency and simplicity of the drug screening greatly.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170307","","Acoustics;Arrays;Biomembranes;Drugs;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Ultrasonic imaging","acoustic intensity;acoustic transducer arrays;bioMEMS;biomedical ultrasonics;bone;cellular biophysics;drugs;fluorescence;self-focusing;ultrasonic transducers","MEMS ultrasonic transducers;SFAT;Self Focused Acoustic transducers;acoustic intensity threshold;acoustic transducer array;cell cytoskeletons;combinatory localized cytolysis;disposable cell culture microwells;drug induced cytoskeleton alteration;drug treatments;fast screening;fluorescence-stained cytolysis assay;fluorescent microscope;micron precision;multispot localized cytolysis","","0","","10","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The merits of the device are to use minimal liquid and to increase the sensitivity for measuring the viscosity. The micro-viscometer is composed of two chambers connected by several micro-channels. Each chamber has a unimorphic piezoelectric diaphragm for driving and sensing sound waves. The micro-channel plays a role as a waveguide and an attenuator of sound waves. Attenuation of sound wave is a function of the viscosity of the liquid. So, the output voltage of sensor is also changed as the viscosity of liquid is changed. After fabrication through micromachining, the device was tested on several viscous liquids, and then it was demonstrated that the device can play a role of a viscometer with high sensitivity.

This design allows most of the cantilever body to freely deform when the compartment shell is deformed with shear forces. Consequently, the stress concentration that is often found in conventional design of such type of sensor is effectively eliminated. The sensor therefore endures larger loading. We measured the relationship between the displacement of the tip of the cantilevers and their change in resistivity, and calculated the sensitivity of the sensors.

The circulating power in the double-ring resonator generates strong optical force, leading to deformation of the suspended ring. As a result, a resonance shift at the output leads to the switching operation. In experiment, a switching contrast of more than 25 dB is achieved, with a switching time of nano-seconds.

A prototype LOBAR device [1] was previously demonstrated and showed great potentials for enabling very high Q resonators for applications such as low phase noise oscillators and narrowband channellizers by taking advantage of the intrinsic low damping of SiC. However, the demonstrated performances were far from ultimate and the SiC LOBAR design space has not been fully explored. Therefore, an analytical model has been developed to further understand the LOBAR operation and provide guidelines for Q optimization in this work. The designed experiments focus on LOBAR optimization by exploring the effect of structural dimension variations such as the piezoelectric film thickness (250 and 500 nm) used for transducing the SiC into vibration, coverage ratio (ratio of AlN area to SiC ranging 0.5-2.5%), and aspect ratio (SiC length to width ratio ranging 6-10) of the resonant cavity on the device Q. Consequently, more than 20% increase in Q (from 4250 to 5378) has been achieved at 1.5 GHz, and over 100% increase in Q (from 1900 to 4296) at 2.3 GHz.

The smaller gap leads to the enormous change in capacitance, realizing the larger output power. Note that this device is not piezoelectric but capacitive. The electret needs no comb-shaped patterning, which is effective for realizing stable and high surface potential. The alignment between mass and electret is not necessary, making fabrication process simple and economical. The output power of 1.2 mW was realized for a forced vibration at 40 Hz/250 μm amplitude. Even if the wire is not connected to the facing counter electrode, which is set over the ferroelectric, the current still flows to the ground thanks to the polarization of ferroelectric. One wiring simplifies the packaging and reduces the electric noise.

Plasma treatment greatly improves the wetability of thin threads and surface quality of the threads. The measured electrical currents on plasma treated threads are 10 times greater than the threads without treatment.

The thin film sapphire (TFS) is fully suspended in air and made to vibrate in the GHz range by a sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN) film. For the first time, the realization of the TFS is achieved via a layer transfer process from a single crystal c-plane sapphire wafer. In order to demonstrate the superior intrinsic material quality of the sapphire membrane, a lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonator (LOBAR) configuration, recently introduced by our group, was employed. The LOBAR is engineered to minimize the effects of mechanical energy dissipation and extract the ultimate limit set by phonon-phonon dissipation in the TFS. In addition to the conventional rectangular design, an annular LOBAR geometry is introduced in this paper. This design permits to lower the device impedance (~3k Ω), while attaining a high quality factor (Q). The measured responses exhibit f·Q of 4.1·10<sup>12</sup> Hz and 4.6·10<sup>12</sup> Hz at 1 and 2 GHz, respectively in the annular configuration with a 9% of transducer to sapphire coverage ratio.

A silicon comb-drive translates a miniature lens across the optical axis in front of an optical circuit to create different viewing angles through a single optical channel. Up to ±50 μm of lens translation has been tested at 24 V<sub>DC</sub> providing stereo acquisition for 3D perception.

The SOI-oxide layer can be added as a capacitor to the classical anodic bonding model, and the behavior of the bonding can be estimated with the basic circuit theory. The oxide capacitance in the model acts as a short circuit at the time instant when the bonding potential is applied, and then it gradually becomes an open circuit.

The viscoplastic behaviors are investigated by uniaxial tensile tests at different strain rates (Figure 2), cyclic loading/unloading test (Figure 3) abrupt strain rate changing (Figure 4), creep-recovery (Figure 5), and stress-relaxation (Figure 6). There are three major conclusions here. First, below a stress of 2.5MPa, no observable viscoplastic behavior of 20-μm-thick parylene-C is found. Secondly, parylene-C film is a strain (or stress) and strain-rate dependent viscoplastic material. Thirdly, Burger's model is adequate to describe both creep and stress relaxation behaviors. In addition, the rate of the creep recovery (modeled with a single time constant) and stress relaxation (modeled with two time constants) decreases with increasing applied stress and/or strain.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170170","","Creep;Films;Fitting;Load modeling;Loading;Strain;Stress","polymer films;recovery-creep;stress relaxation;tensile strength;tensile testing;viscoplasticity","Burger model;creep-recovery;cyclic loading-unloading test;implant material;parylene-C film;size 20 mum;strain rate;stress relaxation;temperature 37 degC;thermal plastic;uniaxial tensile tests;viscoplasticity","","0","","9","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work is applying MEMS technologies to reduce this thermal resistance via the integration of small-scale oscillating actuators into small heat exchangers. Improved HT performance either yields smaller heat sinks or higher heat fluxes.

This allows for improved electromechanical coupling and large operational bandwidth. Measurements are presented to include different excitations and proof masses and an IC for voltage regulation is evaluated. At an excitation frequency of 2 Hz and an acceleration of 2.72 m/s<sup>2</sup> a power output of 2.1 mW was achieved.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170380","","Acceleration;Energy harvesting;Generators;Geometry;Micromechanical devices;Power measurement;Voltage control","cantilevers;energy harvesting;voltage control","IC;electromechanical coupling;frequency 2 Hz;human body motion;impulse excited piezoelectric energy harvesting prototype;piezoelectric cantilevers;power 2.1 mW;random low frequency excitation;scalable piezoelectric impulse-excited generator;voltage regulation","","4","","10","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Measurements on the package LED demonstrate: (1) the surface-patterning of flip-glass reduce refraction at the surface, causing an increase of light emission intensity.

Enabling FRET imaging of stretched cells provides a powerful tool for modern cell biology and mechanobiology [1]. FRET techniques require high magnification as well as a stable focal plane for imaging. Here, we address this requirement for stretchable substrates with a microfabricated cell strain device suitable for live cell imaging while allowing high-resolution FRET microscopy of cells. We adapt a uniaxial cell stretching concept previously demonstrated by Huh [2] for high magnification imaging by using thin bottom channels and membranes supported above an inverted oil immersion objective.

"Challenges and emerging directions in spintronics","Fert, A.","Palaiseau & Univ. Paris-Sud, Orsay, France","Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), 2012 IEEE 25th International Conference on","20120315","2012","","","1","2","Summary form only given. Spintronics is a new field of research exploiting the influence of the electron spin on the electrical conduction. It is mainly known for the “giant magnetoresistance” (GMR)1-2 and the large increase of the hard disc capacity obtained with the read heads based on GMR. But the research on spintronics has also revealed many other interesting effects and is now developing along promising novel directions. The physical basis of spintronics is the influence of the electron spin orientation on the electrical conduction in magnetic materials: the conductivity can be much larger for electrons having, for example, their spin aligned with the magnetization 3-4. The GMR1,2,5 exploits this spin dependence in magnetic multilayers composed by a stack of ultrathin layers (a few nm) with, alternately, layers of magnetic (iron for example) and nonmagnetic metals (copper or chromium for example). A magnetic field, by aligning the magnetizations of all the magnetic layers, makes that there is an electrical short-circuit by half of the electrons which have the “good” spin orientation in ALL the magnetic layers. Without magnetic ordering by an applied field, the short-circuit effect does not exist and the electrical resistance is much larger. The large reduction of the electrical resistance by a magnetic field has been called “giant magnetoresistance” or GMR. The GMR is used to read the magnetic inscriptions on the hard discs of today 6-7 and the possibility of reading smaller inscriptions has led to a considerable increase (three orders of magnitude) of the capacity of the hard discs 6-7. The discovery of the GMR in 1988 kicked off an intense search of other phenomena also related to the influence of the electron spin on the electrical conduction. New effects have been found and this domain of research is now called spintronics8, sometimes described as a new type of electronics exploiting both the charge and the - pin of the electrons. An example of very active field of research is the study of the spin transfer phenomena 9-11. In a spin transfer experiment one manipulates the magnetization orientation of a magnet without applying any magnetic field - the usual way - but by a transfusion of spin angular momentum from a spin-polarized current. This can be used, for example, to reverse the magnetization10 and this will be used soon in the next generation of magnetic memories called STT-RAM. The STT-RAM, in contrast with the semiconductor RAM of today, are nonvolatile, they do not need any electrical power to maintain the memory alive7. This will probably lead to a significant reduction of the energy consumption by the computers ad servers. In another regime the spin transfer can be used to generate oscillation in the radio wave frequency range11. The spin transfer oscillators (STO) are very promising of applications in telecommunications. The research in spintronics extends today in many promising directions. Spintronics with semiconductors aims at combining the potential of conventional semiconductors with the potential of spintronics8. Spintronics with graphene, carbon nanotubes or organic molecules has revealed the advantage of carbon-based materials on metals and semiconductors in term of long spin life time and long spin diffusion length12. The recent results on graphene are promising for the relay of conventional electronics in the so-called “beyond-CMOS” perspective and open the road, for example, to “spin only logic circuits” for a novel type of computer technology. Emerging directions are also single electron spintronics, one of the way to quantum computing, and neuromorphic spintronics in the direction of bio-inspired computers.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170078","","Magnetic domains;Magnetic fields;Magnetic multilayers;Magnetic superlattices;Magnetic tunneling;Magnetoelectronics;Metals","electron spin;magnetoelectronics","bio inspired computers;electrical conduction;electron spin;giant magnetoresistance;hard disc capacity;magnetization;spin transfer oscillators;spintronics","","0","","","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results show that the bubble oscillation amplitude highly depended on the applied frequency and was proportional to the strength of bubble-induced streaming. To improve the controllability of manipulating objects, twin bubbles-induced streaming patterns in the different distances between the twin bubbles were experimentally studied on patterned EWOD electrodes. To transport bubbles in a microfluidic chip, the arrays of EWOD electrodes were microfabricated and EWOD signals were controlled by a digital I/O board through a custom-made Labview code.

With 16.9X improvement on power handling capability for a 9.7-MHz beam resonator via the proposed high-stiffness driving concept, a MEMS-based oscillator referenced to it greatly benefit from power handling enhancement, therefore leading to 26.5 dB reduction in far-from-carrier phase noise as compared to its low-stiffness driving counterpart.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170283","","Electrodes;Optical resonators;Phase noise;Resonant frequency;Sensors;Silicon","micromechanical resonators;oscillators;phase noise","carrier phase noise;high stiffness driven micromechanical resonator oscillator;low stiffness driving configuration;phase noise performance;power handling;series resonant resonator oscillator","","1","","9","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The differences in deformation-mode are determined by loading position and with or without plate support. The specimen made of SCS consists of a SCS plate supported by two SCS micro-beams, and a frame, and was fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) with the same fabrication recipe. All the SCS specimens tested in those deformation-modes were fractured in a brittle manner at a laboratory temperature. The fractured strength was calculated assuming that all the specimens had an ideal flat surface, and the data were arranged using two-parameter Weibull distribution function. Both the specimen size and deformation-mode dependencies were apparently found. To estimate the “true” strength, finite element analyses (FEAs) using the models that included scalloping sidewalls were carried out. The revised strength data that were estimated by multiplying stress concentration factors into the original data suggested that no deformation-mode dependency on strength existed. Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, we have found that specimen size dependency was probably related to the number of nanoscale surface defects that were introduced during a DRIE process.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170221","","Force;Laser beams;Materials;Shape;Strain;Stress;Surface morphology","finite element analysis;microfabrication;scanning electron microscopy;silicon;sputter etching","deep reactive ion etching;deformation mode dependency;finite element analyses;fracture strength;microbeam structures;scanning electron microscopy;single crystal silicon;specimen size;torsion bending","","1","","5","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transponder has two phases of operation: 1) mechanical vibration phase, in which an acoustic receiver (a piezoelectric cantilever) converts the sound vibration into electrical power and charges a capacitor; and 2) electrical radiation phase, in which the stored charge is dumped into an LC tank, forcing it to oscillate at its natural resonance frequency and emitting the energy to an outside receiver. In a pressure sensing configuration, the distance between a planar coil and a ferrite core is modulated by the pressure, thus changing the inductance and in turn inducing a change in the frequency of the emitted signal. A prototype transponder was built and tested using a PZT cantilever with a mechanical resonant frequency of 435 Hz encapsulated in a glass capsule (length=40 mm, diameter=8 mm) along with a rectifier circuitry and a storage capacitor. The inductive pressure sensor located outside the capsule had a sensitivity of 2.5k Hz/kPa.

One order of magnitude multiplication in displacement can be achieved by simple parameters modification and sacrificing die size; using such a new architecture can result in displacement beyond 1 mm while preserving the high yield and productivity.

Nanotubes are grown on a separate die, between the arms of a fork structure, and are subsequently transferred onto receiving electrodes of a device die. The device die is maintained at room-temperature; and thus, it can in principle contain temperature-sensitive readout circuitry. The liquid-free, room-temperature transfer is performed under light microscopy observation, while placement is detected by monitoring the current through the device electrodes. In contrast to manipulation under electron beam observation, electron-beam-induced carbonaceous contamination is prevented. Moreover, pre-selection of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy is rendered possible, avoiding any contamination of the nanomaterial during selection and integration into NEMS.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170417","","CNTFETs;Carbon nanotubes;Electrodes;Logic gates;Nanoscale devices;Substrates","carbon nanotubes;field effect transistors;microactuators;nanotube devices","Raman spectroscopy;device die;device electrodes;dry transfer process;electron beam observation;electron-beam-induced carbonaceous contamination;fork structure;hysteresis-free nanotube field-effect transistors;hysteresis-free transistors;light microscopy observation;low thermal budget;micro-actuated electrodes;microactuators;nanomaterial;nanotube growth temperature;principle contain temperature-sensitive readout circuitry;room-temperature transfer;separate die;single-walled carbon nanotubes;suspended;ultraclean","","1","","15","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is necessary to quantitatively study probe-induced stress on the tissue/neurons and the damage during the probe penetration. Here we propose a vertically-aligned electrical recording neuroprobe array each with the force detection capability during the probe penetration into biological samples (Fig. 1). We fabricated the force sensitive probe array based on piezoresistive p-type silicon probes (~0.9 Ω·cm) with the length of 60 μm and the diameter of 5 μm. The p-type silicon probe array was vertically assembled over an n-type silicon island by using in-situ doping vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth technology. Each probe has two terminal interconnections at the tip and the base formed by three-dimensional metallization process. The probe resistance for the piezoresistance effect in silicon was confirmed by measuring the current-voltage characteristics of vertically assembled individual probes. During the probe penetration, the probe array can also be used for multi-site electrical recordings of neural activities via Pt-black electrodes at probe-tips with a low impedance of 14 KΩ at 1 kHz.","1084-6999","978-1-4673-0324-8","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2012.6170136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170136","","Current measurement;Electrodes;Force;Impedance;Piezoresistance;Probes;Silicon","metallisation;micromechanical devices;neural chips;probes","3D metallization process;MEMS-based penetrating micro-scale probe electrodes;biological sample;current-voltage characteristics;doping vapor-liquid-solid growth technology;electrical recording neuroprobe array;electrophysiological measurement;force detection capability;force sensitive penetrating electrical neuroprobe arrays;force sensitive probe array;multisite electrical recordings;neural activity;piezoresistance effect;piezoresistive p-type silicon probe;probe penetration;probe resistance;probe-induced stress;tissue/neurons","","2","","10","","","Jan. 29 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
