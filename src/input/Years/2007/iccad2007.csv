IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","705","712","In ultra-deep sub-micron technologies, modeling waveform shapes correctly is essential for accurate timing and noise analysis. Due to process and environmental variations, there is a need for a variational waveform model that is compact, efficient and accurate. The mode) should capture correlations due to common dependence on process parameters. This paper proposes a waveform model derived from basic transformations of a nominal waveform in the absence of variations. The transformations are parameterized by variational quantities that capture the sensitivity of the waveform to process parameters. The resulting waveform model works well with current-source models for static timing analysis. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the model both in capturing variational waveforms and in propagating waveforms through logic gates.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397348","","CMOS technology;Circuit optimization;DH-HEMTs;Electronic design automation and methodology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Manufacturing;Predictive models;Semiconductor device modeling;Shape;Timing","logic gates;timing circuits;waveform analysis","current-source models;logic gates;modeling waveform shapes;noise analysis;nominal waveform;static timing analysis;ultradeep submicron technologies;variational waveforms compact modeling;waveform propagation","","3","1","19","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ICCAD 2007.

Process variations affect the on-chip performance of both active and passive components. This necessitates the inclusion of the effect of these variations on distributed interconnect structures in modeling overall circuit performance. In this work, first it is shown through field-solver simulations that larger process variations lead to non-Gaussian PDFs (probability density functions) for the circuit equivalent parameters of distributed passives. Next, a method for accurate statistical analysis of coupled circuit-EM (Electromagnetic) systems without computing the equivalent circuit parameters of EM-modeled objects is demonstrated. This method also obviates the need to generate random variables representing the equivalent circuit parameters, from distributions which are correlated, non-Gaussian and non-closed-form. The proposed approach relies on application of the response surface (RS) methodology to the y-parameters of both the circuit and the distributed structures independently and expressing the eventual performance measures through a suitable combination of the y-parameters. The eventual performance measures are expressed through a hierarchical approach in terms of the underlying Gaussian random variables representing the process parameters. A rapid response surface Monte Carlo (RSMC) analysis on these derived response surfaces furnishes the PDFs and can also be used to predict the yield based on different qualifying criteria and objective functions.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397237","","Analytical models;Circuit optimization;Circuit simulation;Electromagnetic coupling;Equivalent circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Radio frequency;Random variables;Response surface methodology;Statistical analysis","Monte Carlo methods;circuit simulation;equivalent circuits;integrated circuit modelling;probability;response surface methodology;statistical analysis","Gaussian random variable;RF circuits;circuit equivalent parameter;circuit modeling;circuit simulation;coupled circuit-electromagnetic system;equivalent circuit;field-solver simulation;nonGaussian probability density functions;response surface Monte Carlo;statistical analysis","","3","","19","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Song, 2006) has demonstrated that the variation between two devices on the same die due to random mismatch is inversely proportional to the square root of the device area: sigma ~ 1/sqrt(Area). Based on the Pelgrom model, analog devices are sized to be large enough to werage out random variations. Importantly, with CMOS scaling, variations due to random doping fluctuations are making it exceedingly difficult to control device mismatches by sizing alone; namely, the devices have to be made so large that the benefits of CMOS scaling are not realized for analog and RF circuits. In this paper we propose a novel post-silicon timing methodology to reduce random mismatches for analog circuits in sub-90 nm CMOS. A novel dynamic programming algorithm is incorporated into a fast Monte Carlo simulation flow for statistical analysis and optimization of the proposed tunable analog circuits. We apply the proposed post-silicon tuning methodology to several commonly-used analog circuit blocks. We demonstrate that with the post-silicon tuning, device mismatch exponentially decreases as area increases: sigma-exp(-alpha-Area).","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397306","","Analog circuits;CMOS analog integrated circuits;Circuit analysis;Circuit optimization;Doping;Fluctuations;Radio frequency;Semiconductor device modeling;Semiconductor process modeling;Timing","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;circuit tuning;dynamic programming;elemental semiconductors;silicon","CMOS scaling;Monte Carlo simulation flow;Pelgrom model;RF circuits;adaptive post-silicon tuning;analog circuits;dynamic programming algorithm;random doping fluctuations;statistical analysis","","9","1","24","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, analysis of such massively coupled networks is significantly hindered by the sheer size of the network and tight coupling between non-tree interconnects and large numbers of clock drivers. The presented Harmonic-weighted model order reduction algorithm is motivated by the key observation of the steady-state operation of the clock networks, and its efficiency is facilitated by the locality analysis via port sliding. The scalability of the analysis is significantly improved by eliminating the need of computing infeasible multi-port passive reduced order interconnect models with large port count.

The new algorithm introduces a circuit formulation which makes it possible to utilizes either multilayer Green's function or equivalent charge method to extract impedance in multiple dielectrics. The novelty of the formulation is the reduction of the number of unknowns and the application of the hierarchical data structure. The hierarchical data structure permits efficient sparsification transformation and preconditioners to accelerate the linear equation solver. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm is accurate and efficient.

Previously, a charge recycling (CR) MTCMOS architecture was proposed to reduce the large amount of energy consumption that occurs during the mode transitions in power-gated circuits. Considering the RC parasitics of the virtual ground and VDD lines, proper sizing and placement of charge-recycling transistors is key to achieving the maximum power saving. In this paper, we show that the sizing and placement problems of charge-recycling transistors in CR-MTCMOS can be formulated as a linear programming problem, and hence, can be efficiently solved using standard mathematical programming packages. The proposed sizing and placement techniques allow us to employ the CR-MTCMOS solution in large row-based standard cell layouts while achieving nearly the full potential of this power-gating architecture, i.e., we achieve 44% saving in switching energy due to the mode transition in CR-MTCMOS compared to standard MTCMOS.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397362","","CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Chromium;Delay;Energy consumption;Linear programming;Logic devices;Mathematical programming;Recycling;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit packaging;linear programming;recycling","MTCMOS circuits;charge recycling transistor;leakage reduction;linear programming problem;multithreshold;placement techniques;power-gating architecture;row-based standard cell layout;sizing techniques;standard mathematical programming package","","1","","12","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An incompletely specified range pattern can accurately and succinctly represent a process-hotspot where any configuration of objects (that is unknown to the user apriori) can exist in some of its peripheral regions. These new types of range patterns cannot be accurately represented and/or detected using the concept of range patterns introduced in [7]. A new detection algorithm that can accurately detect these new types of patterns is also proposed. This is necessitated since the range pattern matching algorithm proposed earlier causes mismatches: it either misses true matches or reports false matches for these new kinds of patterns.

We transform the problem to a linear programming problem using a robust optimization technique. Our approach can be used in late-stage design where the detailed distribution information is known, and is most useful in early-stage design since our approach does not assume specific underlying distributions. In addition, with the help of block-level timing budgeting, our approach can reduce the timing pessimism. Our approach is applied to the leakage power minimization problem.

To handle the process variation, statistical optimization has emerged as a popular technique for yield improvement. As a relatively new technique, second-order conic programming (SOCP) has recently attracted very much attention in the literature for statistical circuit optimization. However, we observe significant limitations of SOCP in its flexibility, accuracy, and scalability for statistical circuit optimization, especially when interconnects are considered. We thus present in this paper an effective and efficient alternative for multi-constrained statistical circuit optimization by both gate and wire sizing using Lagrangian relaxation (LR).

Temperature, area, and wire length must be simultaneously optimized during 3D floorplanning, significantly increasing optimization complexity. Most existing floorplanners use combinatorial stochastic optimization techniques, hampering performance and scalability when used for 3D floorplanning. In this work, we propose and evaluate a scalable, temperature-aware, force-directed fioorplanner called 3D-STAF. Force-directed techniques, although efficient at reacting to physical information such as temperature gradients, must eventually eliminate overlap. This can cause significant displacement when used for heterogeneous blocks. To smooth the transition from an unconstrained 3D placement to a legalized, layer-assigned floorplan, we propose a three-stage force-directed optimization flow combined with new legalization techniques that eliminate white spaces and block overlapping during multi-layer floorplanning. A temperature-dependent leakage model is used within 3D-STAF to permit optimization based on the feedback loop connecting thermal profile and leakage power consumption. 3D-STAF has good performance that scales well for large problem instances. Compared to recently published 3D floorplanning work, 3D-STAF improves the area by 6%, wire length by 16%, via count by 22%, peak temperature by 6% while running nearly 4times faster on average.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397329","","Energy consumption;Feedback loop;Integrated circuit technology;Scalability;Simulated annealing;Stochastic processes;Temperature dependence;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;White spaces;Wire","integrated circuit layout;optimisation;stochastic processes","3D IC design;3D-STAF;combinatorial stochastic optimization;feedback loop connecting thermal profile;layer-assigned floorplan;leakage power consumption;legalization techniques;scalable temperature-leakage aware floorplanning;three-dimensional integrated circuit;three-stage force-directed optimization flow","","28","1","25","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve CMP quality, dummy feature filling is typically performed by foundries after the routing stage. However, tilling dummy features may greatly degrade the interconnect performance and lead to explosion of mask data. It is thus desirable to consider wire-density uniformity during routing to minimize the side effects from aggressive post-layout dummy filling. In this paper, we present a new full-chip grid-based routing system considering wire density for reticle planarization enhancement. To fully consider wire distribution, the router applies a novel two-pass, top-down planarity-driven routing framework, which employs a new density critical area analysis based on Voronoi diagrams and incorporates an intermediate stage of density-driven layer/track assignment based on incremental Delaunay triangulation.

This reduction is particularly attractive in processors where it is desirable to reduce, the access time between the main logic die and the L2 cache or the main memory die. Process variations in 2D ICs lead to a drop in parametric yield (as measured by speed, leakage and sales profits), which forces manufacturers to speed bin their chips and to sell slow chips at reduced prices. In this paper we develop a model to quantify the impact of process variations on the parametric yield of 3D ICs, and then we propose a number of integration strategies that use a graph-theoretic framework to maximize the performance, parametric yield and profits of 3D ICs. Comparing our proposed strategies to current yield-oblivious methods, it is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the number of 3D ICs in the fastest speed bins by almost 2times, while simultaneously reducing the number of slow ICs by 29.4%.

Due to its complex dependence on operating conditions, especially signal probability, it is a tremendous challenge to accurately predict the degradation rate in reality. On the other hand, we demonstrate in this work that it is feasible to reliably predict the relative importance of gates under NBTI. By identifying critical gates that are the most important ones for timing degradation, we will be able to effectively protect the circuit from aging, with the minimum design overhead. The proposed method is based on a new timing analysis framework that integrates a NBTI-aware library. For each potential critical path, we prove that there exists a particular signal probability, which leads to the worst case of timing degradation. The search of such worst case signal probability provides a safe guardband for the degradation, yet avoiding overly pessimistic analysis. By applying this method to ISCAS and ITC benchmark circuits at the 65 nm node, we demonstrate that in average only 1% of total gates need to be protected in order to control the timing degradation within 10% in ten years. Since this method only requires one-time analysis of each critical path, it is very efficient in computation. With the information of critical gates available, it further enables other resilient design techniques to mitigate circuit aging under NBTI.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397353","","Aging;Circuit optimization;Degradation;Integrated circuit reliability;Libraries;Negative bias temperature instability;Niobium compounds;Protection;Timing;Titanium compounds","logic gates;probability","NBTI-aware library;circuit aging;circuit performance degradation;critical gates identification;negative bias temperature instability;worst case signal probability","","39","","19","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scaling of voltage is associated with larger variations, while Vdd up-scaling or transistor up-sizing for process tolerance can be detrimental for power dissipation. However, for certain signal processing systems such as those used in color image processing, we noted that effective trade-offs can be achieved between Vdd scaling, process tolerance and ""output quality"". In this paper we demonstrate how these tradeoffs can be effectively utilized in the development of novel low-power variation tolerant architectures for color interpolation. The proposed architecture supports a graceful degradation in the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations in sub-70 nm technologies. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that some computations are more important and contribute more to the PSNR improvement compared to the others. The computations are mapped to the hardware in such a way that only the less important computations are effected by Vdd-scaling and process variations.

In this paper, we propose a new global routing algorithm Archer, which resolves some of the most common problems with the state-of-the-art global routers. It is known that concurrent global routing algorithms are typically too expensive to be applied on today's large designs, which may contain up to a million nets. On the other hand, iterative rip-up and reroute (RNR) based algorithms are susceptible to getting stuck in local optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose an RNR-based global routing algorithm that guides the routing iterations out of local optima through effective usage of congestion histories. We also focus on the problem of how to enable a smooth trade-off between seemingly conflicting objectives of overflow and wirelength minimization. Furthermore, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation based bounded-length min-cost topology improvement algorithm that enables Steiner trees to change dynamically for the purpose of congestion optimization. Our experiments show that Archer obtains congestion-free solutions for all circuits in the standard ISPD98 benchmarks, which is the best result published so far. Furthermore, it produces better results than the best results reported in the ISPD-07 Global Routing Contest in terms of routability.

This paper proposes the first unified adaptivity optimization on logical and clock signal tuning, which enables us to significantly save resource. In addition, it does not need any assumption on variation distributions. Our unified optimization is based on a novel linear programming formulation which can be efficiently solved by an advanced robust linear programming technique. Due to the discrete nature of the problem, the continuous solution obtained from linear programming is then efficiently discretized. This procedure involves binary search accelerated dynamic programming, batch based optimization, and Latin Hypercube sampling based fast simulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that up to 50% area cost reduction can be obtained by the unified optimization compared to optimization on logic or clock alone.

As a result, a paradigm shift from deterministic to statistical design methodology at all levels of the design hierarchy is inevitable [1]. In this paper, we propose a variation-aware task allocation and scheduling algorithm for Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architectures to mitigate the impact of parameter variations. A new design metric, called <i>performance yield</i> and defined as the probability of the assigned schedule meeting the predefined performance constraints, is used to guide the task allocation and scheduling procedure.

For example, computing a good quality 6-LUT mapping of an AIG with 1 M nodes takes 150 Mb of RAM and 1 minute on a typical laptop. An extension of the algorithm allows for sequential mapping, which searches the combined space of all possible mappings and retimings.

With bit error rates projected to be as high as 10%, designing a usable nanoscale memory system poses a significant challenge. In particular, we need to bootstrap a sea of unreliable bits into contiguous address ranges which are preferably as large as 4K-byte virtual memory pages. We accomplish this bootstrapping through a combination of dynamic error correction codes within 32-bit blocks and a static defect map which tracks usability of these blocks. The key insight is that statically-determined defect locations can be much more powerful than dynamically correcting for unknown locations, but that defect maps are only practical at a coarse granularity. Using a combination of BCH error correction codes and a Bloom-Filter-based defect map, we achieve a memory efficiency of 60% and 13% for 4K-byte pages at 1% and 10% bit-error rates, respectively.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397359","","Bit error rate;CMOS technology;Error analysis;Error correction codes;Information filtering;Information filters;Manufacturing processes;Nanoscale devices;Prototypes;Usability","BCH codes;error correction codes;error statistics;integrated memory circuits;nanoelectronics","BCH error correction codes;Bloom-filter-based defect map;bit error rates;dynamic defect-tolerance techniques;dynamic error correction codes;nanoscale memory systems;static defect-tolerance techniques;virtual memory pages","","2","3","21","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As delay-noise depends strongly on the skew between the victim-aggressor input transitions', it is not possible to apriori identify the victim input transition that results in the latest arrival time at the victim. Several approaches that heuristically search for the worst-case victim-aggressor alignment have been proposed in literature. In this paper we present an analytical result that obviates the need to search for the worst-case victim input transition, thereby simplifying the victim-aggressor alignment problem significantly. Using the properties of standard nonlinear CMOS drivers, we show that regardless of the switching of the aggressors, the worst-case victim input transition is the one that switches at the latest point in its timing window. Although this result has been empirically observed in the industry, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a rigorous analysis and shows that the result holds for both linear and non-linear drivers. We also show that limiting the alignment of the victim to only the latest victim input transition can significantly reduce the runtime of existing heuristic techniques with no loss of accuracy.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397347","","Capacitance;Circuit noise;Coupling circuits;Crosstalk;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Design automation;Engines;Switches;Timing","CMOS integrated circuits;circuit noise;delays;integrated circuit design;timing","circuit delay;coupling noise;crosstalk aware timing analysis;delay-noise depends;nonlinear CMOS drivers;static timing analysis;victim alignment;victim-aggressor alignment problem;victim-aggressor input transitions;worst-case victim input transition","","0","","16","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, checking if a system, modeled as a set of concurrent processes, is a refinement of another is of tremendous value. In this paper, we focus on concurrent systems modeled as communicating sequential processes (CSP) and show their refinements can be validated using insights from translation validation, automated theorem proving and relational approaches to reasoning about programs. The novelty of our approach is that it handles infinite state spaces in a fully automated manner. We have implemented our refinement checking technique and have applied it to a variety of refinements. We present the details of our algorithm and experimental results.

As crosstalk transitions have significant impact on propagation delay, several bus encoding techniques have been proposed in literature to eliminate such transitions. In this work, we propose a technique, namely, selective shielding, to eliminate crosstalk transitions. Compared to the conventional shielding technique, our technique significantly reduces the number of extra wires.

Our techniques are centered around the understanding that, while the widening process variability calls for accurate non-first-order timing models, their deployment requires well-controlled characterization techniques to cope with the complexity and scalability. We present a methodology by which timing variabilities in interconnects and nonlinear gates are translated efficiently into quadratic timing models suitable for accurate statistical timing analysis.

"TIP-OPC: a new topological invariant paradigm for pixel based optical proximity correction","Peng Yu; Pan, D.Z.","Texas Univ., Austin","Computer-Aided Design, 2007. ICCAD 2007. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","847","853","As the 193 nm lithography is likely to be used for 45 nm and even 32 nm processes, much more stringent requirement will be posed on optical proximity correction (OPC) technologies. Currently, there are two OPC approaches - the model-based OPC (MB-OPC) and the inverse lithography technology (ILT). MB-OPC generates masks which is less complex compared with ILT. But ILT produces much better results than MB-OPC in terms of contour fidelity because ILT is a pixel based method. Observing that MB-OPC preserves the mask shape topologies which leads to a lower mask complexity, we combine the strengths of both methods - the topology invariant property and the pixel based mask representation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that this topological invariant pixel based OPC (TIP-OPC) paradigm is proposed, which fills the critical hole of the OPC landscape and potentially has many new applications. Our technical novelty includes the lithography friendly mask topological invariant operations, the efficient fast Fourier transform based cost function sensitivity computation and the TIP-OPC algorithm.

Existing algorithms for escape routing, an important step in PCB routing, are net-centric. Directly applying these algorithms will result in mixing nets of different buses together. But in practice, it is preferred to bundle together nets in a bus. Thus the bus-centric escape routing problem can be naturally divided into two subproblems: (1) finding a subset of buses that can be routed on the same layer without net mixings and crossings, which we refer to as the bus sequencing problem, and (2) finding the escape routing solutions for each chosen bus, which can be solved by a net-centric escape router. In this paper, we solve the bus sequencing problem. We introduce a new optimization problem called the longest common interval Sequence (LCIS) problem and model the bus sequencing problem as an LCIS problem. By using dynamic programming and balanced search tree data structure, we present an LCIS algorithm which can find an optimal solution in O(n log n) time. We also show that O(n log n) is a lower-bound for this problem and thus the time complexity of our algorithm is also the best possible.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397296","","Binary search trees;Circuit synthesis;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Packaging;Pins;Printed circuits;Routing;Tree data structures;Wires","circuit complexity;circuit optimisation;dynamic programming;network routing;printed circuits;tree searching","PCB routing problem;balanced search tree data structure;bus-centric escape routing problem;dynamic programming;longest common interval sequence problem;net-centric routing;optimal bus sequencing;time complexity","","6","","7","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","667","673","Parameter variations cause high yield losses due to their large impact on circuit delay. In this paper, we propose the use of so-called soft-edge flip-flops as an effective way to mitigate these yield losses. Soft-edge flip-flops have a small window of transparency (ranging from 0.25-3 FO4) instead of a hard edge, allowing limited cycle stealing on critical paths, and thus compensating for delay variations. By enabling time borrowing, soft-edge flip-flops allow random delay variations to average out across multiple logic stages. In addition, they address small amounts of delay unbalance between logic stages, further maximizing the frequency of operation. We develop a library of soft-edge flip-flops with varying amounts of softness. We show that the power and area overhead of soft-edge flip-flops grows directly with the amount of softness. We then propose a statistically aware flip-flop assignment algorithm that maximizes the gain in timing yield while minimizing the incurred power overhead. Experimental results on a wide range of benchmark circuits show that the proposed approach improves the mean delay by 1.9-22.3% while simultaneously reducing the standard deviation of delay by 1.9-24.1% while increasing power by a small amount (0.3-2.8%).","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397342","","Circuits;Clocks;Delay effects;Design optimization;Flip-flops;Frequency;Latches;Libraries;Logic;Timing","delays;flip-flops;logic design;timing","benchmark circuits;circuit delay;high yield losses;incurred power overhead minimization;mean delay;random delay variations;soft-edge flip-flops","","8","","16","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Compatibility path based binding algorithm for interconnect reduction in high level synthesis","Taemin Kim; Xun Liu","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh","Computer-Aided Design, 2007. ICCAD 2007. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","435","441","This paper describes a register and functional unit (FU) binding algorithm in high level synthesis. Our algorithm targets the reduction of multiplexer inputs. Since multiplexers connect multiple inputs to FUs or registers, the multiplexer count is a good indicator of the interconnect complexity. Reducing the number of multiplexer inputs results in reducing interconnect cost. Specifically, our algorithm constructs a weighted and ordered compatibility graph, and binds operations that form a long path in the graph together. As a result, operations with many flow dependencies and common inputs are bound to same FU, leading to a small number of FU inputs. In addition, the operation variables generated by a single FU are assigned to the same register so that connections between FUs and registers are reduced. We have implemented our algorithm within a MATLAB to Verilog conversion tool, and applied it to a suite of benchmark programs. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme achieves 11.8%. 43.6% and 58.8% multiplexer input count reduction on average over weighted bipartite matching algorithm, k-cofamily algorithm and left edge algorithm, respectively. To assess the impact on interconnect reduction, we have generated layouts of the circuits from our Verilog description. It is shown that our approach delivers a 10.1% reduction in total wire-length of global interconnects with minor area overhead of register and FUs in comparison to the best previously proposed scheme.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397304","","Costs;Fabrication;Hardware design languages;High level synthesis;Integrated circuit interconnections;MATLAB;Multiplexing;Power system interconnection;Registers;Transistors","hardware description languages;high level synthesis;multiplexing equipment","Verilog conversion tool;compatibility path based binding algorithm;functional unit;high level synthesis;interconnect complexity;interconnect reduction;multiplexer;register","","8","","27","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are presenting the first approach of an adaptive on-chip communication scheme. It provides an adaptive routing/path allocation algorithm to meet a required level of QoS (guaranteed bandwidth). In our architecture adaptive runtime links are established by re-assigning buffer blocks on-demand. This adaptive buffer allocation scheme increases the buffer utilization and decreases the overall buffer use on an average of 42% in our case study analysis compared to a fixed buffer assignment strategy. The area overhead introduced by the adaptive scheme can be traded-off against the flexibility in order to select an available path and on-demand buffer allocation.

As a result, a timing-aware signal polarities assigning technique is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel signal polarities assigning technique which can not only reduce peak current and power/ground noises simultaneously but also render the clock skew in control.

In the unit-level verification, a unit is first embedded in a complex software that emulates the behavior of surrounding units, and then a sequence of stimuli is applied to measure the functional coverage. In order to generate such a sequence, designers need to comprehend the relationship between boundaries at the unit under verification and at the inputs to the emulation software. However, figuring out this relationship can be very difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes an incremental learning framework that incorporates an ordered-binary-decision-forest(OBDF) algorithm, to automate estimating the controllability of unit-level signals and to provide full-chip level information for designers to govern these signals. Mathematical analysis shows that the proposed OBDF algorithm has lower model complexity and lower error variance than the previous algorithms. Meanwhile, a commercial microprocessor core is also applied to demonstrate that controllability of input signals on the load/store unit in the microprocessor core can be estimated automatically and information about how to govern these signals can also be extracted successfully.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397274","","Algorithm design and analysis;Controllability;Data mining;Embedded software;Emulation;Mathematical analysis;Mathematical model;Microprocessors;Signal design;Software measurement","binary decision diagrams;controllability;learning (artificial intelligence);logic CAD;microprocessor chips","full-chip functional verification;incremental learning framework;microprocessor designs;ordered-binary-decision-forest;signal controllability;stimuli sequence;unit-level verification","","3","","19","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","155","159","As chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are being increasingly used in embedded computing, optimizing data locality considering interprocessor interactions is becoming critical. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new abstraction called the interprocessor data reuse vector, which captures the reuse distance (in terms of loop iterations) between successive accesses to a given data element from different processors. Based on this reuse vector, we then present a data locality optimization scheme. A unique characteristic of this scheme is that it allows application of different transformations to different processors of the CMP if this helps improve locality of data shared across processors. We automated our approach within an optimizing compiler and collected statistics using eight application codes.

In this paper, we propose a method to calculate the length of the potentially sensitizable longest path for detection of a transition fault.

For efficient RTL synthesis, it is important to identify good decompositions of the polynomial into smaller/simpler units. Symbolic computer algebra algorithms and tools have been used for this purpose. However, fixed-size (m) bit-vector arithmetic is polynomial algebra over the finite integer ring Z<sub>2</sub>m, which is a non-unique factorization domain (non-UFD). While non-UFDs provide an extra freedom to search for decompositions, they complicate polynomial manipulation as traditional division-based algorithms are inapplicable. This paper presents new mathematical concepts for polynomial decomposition over Z<sub>2</sub>m, for RTL synthesis over fixed-size m-bit vectors. Given a polynomial, we identify a specific set of linear expressions and compute the Grobner bases of their ideal (over non-UFD Z<sub>2</sub>m) using syzygies. This basis serves as good building-blocks for the given computation. A decomposition is identified by subsequent Grobner basis reduction.

This results in significant random Vt variations in PMOS transistor. The NBTI induced variation depends on operating temperature and the effective stress period for the specific device.

At the same time, it ensures not invalidating the subsequent clock skew scheduling for optimizing the clock period. We use the switching power as the native objective of our register binding problem. The problem is first formulated as a MILP problem. An acceleration scheme based on the concept of weakly compatible edge set (WCES) is proposed to speed up the MILP solver to obtain the optimal solution. Then, we present our heuristic algorithm to reduce the running time further. The experimental results show that on average our acceleration scheme can speed up the solver by 8.6 times, and our heuristic is 70 times faster than the solver with a 5.25% degradation of the native objective.

In this paper, we first propose a methodology to extract a small set of logic functions that are able to implement a large portion of functions for given FPGA applications. Assuming that the extracted logic functions are implemented by macro-gates in PLBs, we then develop a complete synthesis flow for such heterogeneous PLBs with mixed LUTs and macro-gates.

Prior approaches to the exploration of functional dependency are based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs), which may not be easily scalable to large designs. This paper proposes a novel reformulation that extensively exploits the capability of modern satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Thereby, functional dependency is detected effectively through incremental SAT solving, and the dependency function h, if it exists, is obtained through Craig interpolation. The main strengths of the proposed approach include: (1) fast detection of functional dependency with modest memory consumption and thus scalable to large designs, (2) a full capacity to handle a large set of base functions and thus discovering dependency whenever exists, and (3) potential application to large-scale logic optimization and verification reduction.

Tailored for WNoC, SD-MAC employs a binary countdown approach to resolve channel contention between RF nodes. The receiver_select_sender mechanism and hidden terminal elimination scheme are proposed to increase the throughput and channel utilization of the system. Our simulation study shows the promising performance of SD-MAC in terms of throughput, latency, and network utilization.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","310","317","Variable hiding and predicate abstraction are two popular abstraction methods to obtain simplified models for model checking. Although both methods have been used successfully in practice, no attempt has been made to combine them in counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR). In this paper, we propose a hybrid abstraction method that allows both visible variables and predicates to take advantages of their relative strengths. We use refinement based on weakest preconditions to add new predicates, and under certain conditions trade in the predicates for visible variables in the abstract model. We also present heuristics for improving the overall performance, based on static analysis to identify useful candidates for visible variables, and use of lazy constraints to find more effective unsatisfiable cores for refinement. We have implemented the proposed hybrid CEGAR procedure. Our experiments on public benchmarks show that the new abstraction method frequently outperforms the better of the two existing abstraction methods.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397283","","Chaos;Concrete;Hardware;Laboratories;National electric code;Performance analysis;State-space methods;System-level design","data flow graphs;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic testing;program diagnostics","Verilog;control flow graphs;counterexample guided abstraction refinement loop;data flow graphs;hardware verification;hybrid CEGAR procedure;hybrid abstraction method;model checking;predicate abstraction;static analysis;variable hiding;weakest preconditions","","2","","24","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If an implementation does not fulfill its specification, counterexamples are used to explain the error effect to the designer. In order to be understood by the designer, counterexamples should be simple, i.e. they should be as general as possible and assign values to a minimal number of input signals. Here we use the concept of <i>Black Boxes</i> - parts of the design with unknown behavior - to mask out components for counterexample computation. By doing so, the resulting counterexample will argue about a reduced number of components in the system to facilitate the task of understanding and correcting the error. We introduce the notion of 'uniform counterexamples' to provide an exact formalization of simplified counterexamples arguing only about components which were not masked out. Our computation of counterexamples is based on symbolic methods using AIGs (And-Inverter-Graphs). Experimental results using a VLIW processor as a case study clearly demonstrate our capability of providing simplified counterexamples.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397277","","Boolean functions;Computer errors;Computer science;Data structures;Debugging;Error correction;Safety;Sequential circuits;Signal design;VLIW","sequential circuits;temporal logic","And-Inverter-Graphs;VLIW processor;black box techniques;counterexamples computation;error diagnosis;sequential systems debugging;symbolic methods","","7","","32","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One critical problem for biochip synthesis is the droplet routing problem. Unlike traditional VLSI routing problems, in addition to routing path selection, the biochip routing problem needs to address the issue of scheduling droplets under the practical constraints imposed by the fluidic property and the timing restriction of the synthesis result. In this paper, we present the first network-flow based routing algorithm that can concurrently route a set of non-interfering nets for the droplet routing problem on biochips. We adopt a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, we first identify a set of non-interfering nets and then adopt the network-flow approach to generate optimal global-routing paths for the nets. In detailed routing, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for simultaneous routing and scheduling using the global-routing paths with a negotiation-based routing scheme.

Even in DC conditions, current densities in some grid branches may increase for some gating configurations to the extent of violating electromigration (EM) constraints. Tlie existing DC methods for grid sizing optimize the grid area under voltage drop (IR) and EM constraints for one configuration of circuit blocks connected to the grid. We show that these methods cannot be directly applied for optimizing power-gated grids. We analyze the effects of EM and IR voltage drop in power grids with multiple power gating configurations. Based on our analyses, we develop a grid sizing algorithm to satisfy all reliability constraints for all feasible gating configurations.

Although techniques exist to extract compact VCO phase macromodels, a direct parametrization of VCO macromodels over a large set of parametric variations not only results in highly complex models, but also leads to significantly high computational cost. In this paper, an efficient parameterized VCO phase model generation technique is presented to capture the impacts of statistical parametric variations. The model extraction cost of our approach is significantly reduced by exploiting circuit-specific parameter dimension reduction, which effectively reduces the parameter space dimension over which the phase model needs to be extracted. The application of parameter reduction is facilitated by a novel and fast time-domain sampling technique that provides the essential statistical correlation data. Our numerical experiments have shown that the proposed model generation approach is more efficient than brute-force parametric modeling while producing accurate parameterized phase models that can capture large range parametric variations.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397374","","Availability;Circuit synthesis;Computational efficiency;Costs;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear equations;Sampling methods;Time domain analysis;Timing;Voltage-controlled oscillators","statistical analysis;voltage-controlled oscillators","VCO phase macromodel generation;parameter dimension reduction;statistical parametric variation;time-domain sampling technique;voltage controlled oscillator","","4","","12","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiple supply voltages (MSV's) provide an effective technique for the power optimization. This paper addresses the voltage-island generation problem for MSV designs at the post-floorplanning stage. We first present a general formulation of this problem that considers level-shifter planning and power-network routing resources. Without loss of solution quality, we propose an economical graph-based representation that needs only a linear number of nodes to the block number to model the block adjacency in a floorplan for the voltage-island generation. In contrast, previous works need a quadratic number of nodes. To tackle the addressed problem, we employ an ILP formulation which consists of (1) level-shifter aware wirelength estimation to capture the timing overhead, (2) voltage-island-clustering inequalities to avoid complicated constraint transformations, and (3) inequalities to capture the power-network routing-resource usage. Compared with previous works, our algorithm can produce better voltage islands in terms of power-network routing resources. Experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively reduce the power-network routing resource by up to 19.46% with a reasonable overhead of 4.03% more power consumption and using reasonable running time.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397339","","Circuit synthesis;Cost function;Design optimization;Energy consumption;Power generation;Power generation economics;Routing;Space exploration;Timing;Voltage","distributed power generation;graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;power distribution planning;power transmission planning","graph-based representation;integer linear programming;level-shifter planning;post-floorplanning voltage-island generation;power consumption;power optimization;power-network planning;power-network routing-resource usage;voltage-island-clustering inequalities;wirelength estimation","","16","","15","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The models also considers current variation due to process variation with spatial correlation. We then propose an iterative alternative programming algorithm to solve the decap budgeting problem under the stochastic current model. Experiments using industrial examples show that compared with the baseline model which assumes maximum currents at all ports and under the same decap area constraint, the model considering temporal correlation reduces the noise by up to 5times, and the model considering both temporal and logic-induced correlations reduces the noise by up to 17times. Compared with the model using deterministic process parameters, considering process variation tLej f variation in this paper reduces the mean noise by up to 4times and the 3 sigma noise by up to 13times. While the existing stochastic optimization has been used mainly for process variation purpose, this paper to the best of our knowledge is the first in-depth study on stochastic optimization taking into account both operation and process variations for power network design.

The goal is to allocate the minimum number of registers such that no scalar variable is spilled to memory. Previously, an optimal polynomial-time algorithm for this problem has been presented for individual procedures represented in Static Single Assignment (SSA) Form. This result is now extended to complete programs (or sub-programs), as long as: (1) each procedure is represented in SSA Form; and (2) at every procedure call, all live variables are split at the call point. With this representation, it is possible to ensure that the interprocedural interference graph (IIG) is chordal, and can therefore be colored optimally in polynomial time. An optimal coloring of the IIG can be achieved by allocating registers for each procedure individually. Previous work has shown that optimal register allocation in SSA Form does not require an interference graph. Optimal interprocedural register allocation, therefore, is achieved without constructing an interference graph, giving the optimal algorithm a significant runtime advantage over prior sub-optimal heuristics.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397262","","Application specific processors;Embedded system;Hardware;High level synthesis;Interference;Laboratories;Polynomials;Process design;Registers;Time to market","graph theory;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;polynomials","ASIP design;application-specific instruction set processors;high-level synthesis;interprocedural interference graph;optimal polynomial-time interprocedural register allocation;static single assignment form;suboptimal heuristics","","2","","31","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","180","187","The time separation of events (TSE) problem is that of finding the maximum and minimum separation between the times of occurrence of two events in a concurrent system. It has applications in the performance analysis, optimization and verification of concurrent digital systems. This paper introduces an efficient polynomial-time algorithm to give exact bounds on TSE's for choice-free concurrent systems, whose operational semantics obey the max-causality rule. A choice-free concurrent system is modeled as a strongly-connected marked graph, where delays on operations are modeled as bounded intervals with unspecified distributions. While previous approaches handle acyclic systems only, or else require graph unfolding until a steady-state behavior is reached, the proposed approach directly identifies and evaluates the asymptotic steady-state behavior of a cyclic system via a graph-theoretical approach.

Based on this concept, we develop and prove theorems that constitute sufficient and necessary conditions to establish conflict-free VCs. Using these theorems, slot allocation for VCs becomes a procedure of computing LNs and then assigning VCs to different LNs. TDM VC configuration can thus be predictable and correct-by-construction.

But different from the existing Hermit PC based stochastic simulation method, extended Krylov subspace method (EKS) is employed to compute variational responses using the augmented matrices consisting of the coefficients of Hermite polynomials. Our contribution lies in the combination of the statistical spectrum method with the extended Krylov subspace method to fast solve the variational circuit equations for the first time.

In this work, soft-error reliability is improved with minimal area overhead by careful, localized circuit restructuring. The key idea is to increase logic masking of errors by taking advantage of conditions already present in the circuit, such as observability don't-cares. We describe two circuit modification techniques to improve reliability: don't-care-based resynthesis and local rewriting. A key feature of these techniques is fast, on-the-fly estimation of soft error rate (SER) using our reliability evaluator AnSER. This tool is compared against prior SER evaluators and found to run orders of magnitude faster.

Existing research results for leakage-aware DVS scheduling perform procrastination of real-time jobs greedily so that the idle time can be aggregated as long as possible to turn off the processor. This paper proposes algorithms for the procrastination determination of periodic real-time tasks in uniprocessor systems. Instead of greedy procrastination, the procrastination procedures are applied only when the evaluated energy consumption is less than not procrastination.

"Exploiting hierarchy and structure to efficiently solve graph coloring as SAT","Velev, M.N.","","Computer-Aided Design, 2007. ICCAD 2007. IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","135","142","Many important EDA problems can be formulated as graph coloring, which is a class of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). This paper makes three contributions First, we define new encodings for representing CSPs as equivalent Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems: (1) a generalization of the log encoding by using ITE trees to select the domain values of a CSP variable, so that only conflict clauses are required; and (2) a simplified direct encoding, derived from the direct encoding (Where each domain value of a CSP variable is indexed by a unique Boolean variable) by omitting one of the Boolean variables and the at-least-one clause. Second, we propose the use of hierarchical encodings that combine several simple encodings to index the domain values of CSP variables, in order to produce SAT formulas that depend on fewer Boolean variables and are easier to solve. Third, we study schemes for static ordering of the Boolean variables in a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) representation of a CSP, based on the structure of the CSP graph, such that the resulting variable order is used for the decisions made by a SAT solver when evaluating the CNF. We compare 12 previously known SAT encodings for CSP with the two new encodings, as well as with 10 hybrid encodings. With symmetry-breaking constraints enforced, static variable ordering produced up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup. Additionally exploiting hierarchical encodings resulted in another order of magnitude speedup.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397256","","Circuit testing;Computer science;Electronic design automation and methodology;Encoding;Processor scheduling;Radio spectrum management;Resource management;Technological innovation;Tree graphs;Very large scale integration","Boolean functions;computability;constraint theory;electronic design automation;graph colouring;trees (mathematics)","Boolean satisfiability problems;Boolean variables;EDA problems;ITE trees;SAT;conjunctive normal form;constraint satisfaction problem;encoding;graph coloring;static variable ordering;symmetry-breaking constraints","","7","","69","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to lower the power consumption is to reduce the supply voltage. Multi-supply voltage (MSV) is thus introduced to provide higher flexibility in controlling the power and performance trade-off. In region-based MSV, circuits are partitioned into ""voltage islands"" where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one supply voltage. These tasks of island partitioning and voltage level assignments should be done simultaneously in the floorplanning process in order to take those important physical information into consideration. In this paper, we consider this core-based voltage island driven floorplanning problem including islands with power down mode, and propose a method to solve it. Given a candidate floorplan solution represented by a normalized Polish expression, we are able to obtain optimal voltage assignment and island partitioning (including islands with power down mode) simultaneously to minimize the total power consumption. Simulated annealing is used as the basic searching engine. By using this approach, we can achieve significant power savings (up to 50%) for all data sets, without any significant increase in area and wire length. Our floorplanner can also be extended to minimize the number of level shifters between different voltage islands and to simplify the power routing step by placing the islands in proximity to the corresponding power pins.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397338","","Circuits;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Pins;Routing;Search engines;Simulated annealing;System-on-a-chip;Voltage control;Wire","network synthesis;power consumption;system-on-chip","SoC;core-based voltage island;energy efficiency;multi-supply voltage;optimal voltage assignment;power consumption;power savings;system-on-a-chip designs;voltage island-driven floorplanning;voltage level assignments","","10","","8","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method uses variable domain translators to change the variables to which the AC perturbation is applied and from which the AC response is measured. By utilizing the efficient periodic AC (PAC) analysis available in commercial RF simulators, the circuit's linear transfer function in the desired variable domain can be characterized without relying on extensive transient simulations. Furthermore, the variable domain translators enable the circuits to be macromodeled as weakly-nonlinear systems in the chosen domain and then converted to voltage-domain models, instead of being modeled as strongly-nonlinear systems directly.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397376","PAC analysis;Simulation;domain transformation;linear analysis","Active filters;Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Circuit analysis computing;Circuit simulation;Delay;Frequency;SPICE;Transfer functions;Voltage","circuit simulation;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;transfer functions;transient analysis","circuit linear transfer function;commercial RF simulator;delay-locked loop;duty-cycle corrector;extensive transient simulation;linear PAC analysis;mixed-signal system;periodic AC analysis;phase locked loop;variable domain transformation","","5","","26","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applying constant insertion can increase a cell's flexibility in aspect of functionalities, so far-away spare cells need not be used just for some specific functionality.

In this paper, we study the problem of layout optimization for the hierarchical circuits in modern VLSI designs which essentially can be formulated as the integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Existing approaches are either unable to handle hierarchy, inefficient or failing to provide the feasible integer solutions for large scale hierarchical layouts. We present a practical method, IRLS algorithm (iteratively rounding and LP solving) which consists of a proper rounding strategy based on the careful analysis of hierarchical layout constraints, to obtain a feasible integer solution in the constraint-based layout modification process, thus enabling efficient optimization for large scale hierarchical layouts, and specifically avoiding the need to use the general ILP solvers. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the IRLS algorithm. Compared with the general ILP/MILP solver, the IRLS algorithm can obtain decent results with much less runtime (speed-up ranging from 4.000X to 360.000X). Compared with the two-step approach(Allen et al., 2003) on legalizing a set of large scale industry circuit layouts, the IRLS algorithm can provide much better solution (satisfying all abutment/alignment constraints that the two-step approach fails to meet).","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397250","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuit optimization;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Integer linear programming;Iterative algorithms;Large-scale systems;Manufacturing;Optimization methods;Very large scale integration","VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit tuning;design for manufacture;integer programming;integrated circuit layout;iterative methods;linear programming;logic CAD;mathematics computing","ILP solvers;IRLS algorithm;VLSI design;circuit design migration;circuit performance tuning;constraint-based layout modification process;design for manufacturing;feasible integer solution;hierarchical circuit layout optimization;integer linear programming;iteratively rounding and LP solving algorithm","","0","","13","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multipart current source model (MCSM) is one of the most general models in this class, which has been shown to handle multiple electrical effects including multiple-input switching (MIS) events in timing. However, this new model is hampered by two major problems: port characterization runtime and accuracy across a range of complicated cells which are deployed in advanced microprocessor design such as complex combinational cells, muxes, and sequentials. In this paper we demonstrate a significant leap in modeling accuracy and characterization runtime over the MCSM model which effectively eliminates these remaining issues. The quality of the new approach is conclusively demonstrated on a comprehensive 45nm cell library currently in use.

IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20071210","2007","","","442","449","We define operation chaining (op-chaining) as an optimization problem to determine the optimal pipeline depth for balancing performance against energy demands in pipelined asynchronous designs. Since there are no clock period requirements, asynchronous pipeline stages can have non-uniform latencies. We exploit this fact to coalesce several stages together thereby saving power and area due to the elimination of control-path resources from the pipeline. The trade-off is potentially reduced pipeline parallelism. In this paper, we formally define this optimization as a graph covering problem, which finds sub-graphs that will be synthesized as an op-chained pipeline stage. We then define the solution space for provably correct solutions and present an algorithm to efficiently search this space. The search technique partitions the graph based on post-dominator relationships to find sub-graphs that are potential op-chain candidates. We use knowledge of the Global Critical Path (GCP) [13] to evaluate the performance impact of accepting a candidate sub-graph and formulate a heuristic cost function to model this trade-off. The algorithm has a quadratic-time complexity in the size of the dataflow graph. We have implemented this algorithm within an automated asynchronous synthesis toolchain [12].

The ML-OARSMT problem is very important for many VLSI designs with pins being located in multiple routing layers that contain numerous routing obstacles incurred from IP blocks, power networks, prerouted nets, etc. Therefore, it is desired to develop an effective algorithm for the ML-OARSMT problem. However, there is no existing work on this ML-OARSMT problem. In this paper, we first formulate the ML-OARSMT problem and identify key different properties of the problem from its single-layer counterpart.

The new effective capacitance calculation technique poses no extra complexity as compared to the RC based approaches but can accommodate inductance. These new expressions are derived based on a generalized driving point admittance. The generalized driving point admittance takes inductance into consideration and hence accounts for the inductive shielding that in some cases can even exceed the resistive shielding in current technologies. Another improvement in the new effective capacitance calculation method is the utilization of a more general waveform shape that accounts for the non-monotonic behavior due to inductance effects. It is shown throughout the paper that two effective capacitances are required for accurate estimation of the propagation delay and rise time with an RLC interconnect load. Simulation results show that the error in propagation delays and rise times when neglecting inductance can be over 60% as compared to an RLC model in realistic interconnects.

Such processors tend to meet the demanding performance constraints by accommodating application specific instruction set extensions (ISEs) which have, naturally, become a vital component of current processor customization flows. One major bottleneck in maximizing ISE performance is the limitation on the data-bandwidth between the general purpose register (GPR) file and the ISEs. For improved performance, it is desirable to have a large data-bandwidth from the GPRs to ISEs. However, the tight area constraints of modern embedded processors often restrict the GPR I/O of ISEs to save port area of the register files. This paper presents a novel approach to increase the GPR I/O of ISEs without significantly increasing the size of the GPR files. This is achieved by applying the concept of register clustering, common in many VLIW architectures, to single-issue processors with high performance ISEs. Such clustering often causes extra register moves in compiled code. This work also presents an algorithm to minimize such register moves. The benchmark results presented in this paper show that our solution can significantly reduce the area overhead of many-port GPR files without sacrificing the performance improvements through ISEs.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397261","","Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Embedded system;Ground penetrating radar;Hardware;Registers;Signal design;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;VLIW","embedded systems;instruction sets;logic CAD;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;performance evaluation;program compilers;system-on-chip","VLIW architecture;application specific instruction-set extension;code compilation;configurable customizable processor core;data-bandwidth maximization;embedded system-on-chip design;many-port GPR file;performance improvement;register clustering","","7","","24","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Equations for frequency, power dissipation, die area, loop gain and phase noise are formulated in posynomial forms. The resulting optimization problem is relaxed to be a Geometric Programming (GP) and can be efficiently solved with a convex optimization solver. A novel scheme to control the rotation direction is also suggested for skew control.

Such an yield factor estimator at the global routing stage is essential since it can used to either get an early estimate of the final yield of the same design (i.e. the yield after applying the required sequence of detailed routing and post-routing yield optimizations) and/or to improve the final yield of the design by making the solution at the end of global routing more amenable to post-routing yield optimizations. The proposed yield factor estimator is inherently flexible and can easily be programmed to estimate during global routing a variety of key yield factors of the same design after a typical sequence of detailed routing and representative post-routing yield optimizations has been applied. Examples are provided to show how the yield factor estimator can be used to predict short and open critical area and metal density after typical yield optimization solutions like wire-spreading, wire-widening and metal filling, respectively. Experimental results presented in the paper show that the proposed yield factor estimator can predict final yield factor hotspots/values with a high degree of accuracy.

This is due to the significant amount of data that must be stored during the execution of the algorithmic specification, as well as due to the amount of data transfers to/from large, energy-consuming, off-chip data memories. This paper addresses the problem of efficiently mapping the multidimensional signals from the algorithmic specification of the system into the physical memory. Different from all the previous mapping models that aim to optimize the memory sharing between the elements of a same array, creating separate windows in the physical memory for distinct arrays, this proposed mapping model is the first one to exploit the possibility of memory sharing between different arrays.

On-chip decoupling capacitors have traditionally been allocated into the white space available on the die based on an unsystematic or ad hoc approach. In this way, large decoupling capacitors are often placed at a significant distance from the current load, compromising the signal integrity of the system. This issue of power delivery cannot be alleviated by simply increasing the size of the on-chip decoupling capacitors. To be effective, the on-chip decoupling capacitors should be placed physically close to the current loads. The area occupied by the on-chip decoupling capacitor, however, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the capacitor. The minimum impedance between the on-chip decoupling capacitor and the current load is therefore fundamentally affected by the magnitude of the capacitor. A distributed on-chip decoupling capacitor network is proposed in this paper. A system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors is shown to provide an efficient solution for providing the required on-chip decoupling capacitance under existing technology constraints. In a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors, each capacitor is sized based on the parasitic impedance of the power distribution grid. Various tradeoffs in a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors are also discussed. Related simulation results for typical values of on-chip parasitic resistance are also presented. An analytic solution is shown to provide accurate distributed system. The worst case error is 0.003% as compared to SPICE. Techniques presented in this paper are applicable not only for current technologies, but also provide an efficient placement of the on-chip decoupling capacitors in future technology generations.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397365","Power distribution systems;decoupling capacitors;power distribution grids;power noise","Capacitors;Impedance;Network-on-a-chip;Noise reduction;Parasitic capacitance;Power distribution;Power supplies;SPICE;System-on-a-chip;White spaces","integrated circuits;power capacitors;power distribution","SPICE;distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors;nanoscale IC;on-chip parasitic are resistance;parasitic impedance;power distribution grid;power supply noise reduction","","11","1","13","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we adopt a geostatistics motivated approach (i.e. Kriging model) for efficient extraction of yield-aware Pareto front performance models for analog circuits. An iterative search based optimization approach is proposed to efficiently seek optimal performance tradeoffs under yield constraints in high-dimensional design parameter and process variation spaces.

This paper offers an alternative solution by casting the problem into the theoretic frame work of non-linear non-Gaussian filtering. To estimate the mean and variance of the time-dependent circuit trajectory, we develop a method based on unscented transformation, which is an efficient Bayesian analysis sampling technique.

To address this, at speed test has been employed to detect subtle delay failures in manufacturing. However, the increasing process spread in advanced nanometer ASICs poses considerable challenges to predicting hardware performance from timing models. Performance verification in the presence of process variation is difficult because the critical path is no longer unique. Different paths become frequency limiting in different process corners. In this paper, we present a novel variation-aware method based on statistical timing to select critical paths for structural test. Node criticalities are computed to determine the probabilities of different circuit nodes being on the critical path across process variation. Moreover, path delays are projected into different process corners using their linear delay function forms. Experimental results for three multimillion gate ASICs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-1381-2","978-1-4244-1382-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2007.4397299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397299","","Application specific integrated circuits;Circuit faults;Circuit testing;Contracts;Delay;Logic testing;Manufacturing;Probability;Space technology;Timing","application specific integrated circuits;delays;formal specification;formal verification;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;statistical analysis","advanced nanometer ASIC;circuit nodes;linear delay function forms;node criticality;path delays;statistical timing;structural timing;variation-aware performance verification","","23","9","18","","","4-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"GLADE: A modern global router considering layer directives","Yen-Jung Chang; Tsung-Hsien Lee; Ting-Chi Wang","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Nat.

In order to boost the research and development of global routing techniques, ISPD held contests and released benchmarks in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, the contests may lead researchers away from facing other real problems in practice. In this paper we study a new global routing problem that not only considers traditional routing objectives such as overflow and wirelength but also focuses on honoring layer directives that are usually specified for timing-critical nets to alleviate performance degrading. Based on novel extensions of an academic router, we present a new global router called GLADE for the addressed problem. The experimental results show that GLADE can effectively generate a high-quality solution, which balances the metrics under consideration, for each test case from the set of recently released ICCAD 2009 benchmarks.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654094","","Asia;Benchmark testing;Design automation;Measurement;Routing;Three dimensional displays;Wire","network routing;network-on-chip","GLADE;ICCAD 2009;ISPD;global router;layer directive;network-on-a-chip","","5","","22","","","7-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The FPD industry has been dominated by the liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which are advancing so rapidly that it seems difficult for other technologies to compete in the marketplace, despite all the enthusiasm and innovation emerging from research laboratories in both universities and industry for decades. On the other hand, with the continuous development of related materials and device architectures for efficient and stable organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), the commercialization of active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display products is accelerating [1]. AMOLED displays provide a set of attractive attributes to be used for high-quality video applications, such as excellent contrast ratio, ultra-fast response, vivid visual full-color appearance, and mechanically, a thinner and simpler structure compared to LCDs. AMOLEDs are rapidly expanding their market share for small-sized mobile applications since their mass production launch in 2007, and are also expected to enter the arena of larger-area displays for TVs soon [2].","1092-3152","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386746","","Active matrix organic light emitting diodes;Batteries;Consumer electronics;Mobile communication;Power demand;Thin film transistors","LED displays;flat panel displays;liquid crystal displays;network synthesis;organic light emitting diodes;transistor circuits","AMOLED displays;FPD industry;Internet;LCD;TV;active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display;camcorders;digital multimedia era;full-color appearance;high-quality video applications;high-resolution flat-panel displays;liquid crystal displays;mobile-smart phone;notebook PC;pixel circuit design;small-sized mobile applications;transistor technology;ultra-fast response","","0","","6","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
