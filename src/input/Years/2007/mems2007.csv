Strong reflection induced by larger index mismatch and longer optical path from GNPs-protein conjugation are suggested to attribute most to the signal enhancement in F-P interference shift. The experiments carry out the monitoring of immuno-sensing in real-time by the employment of rabbit IgG conjugate to GNPs-anti-rabbit IgG And the detection limit was demonstrated to approach 0.17 nM (-25.5 ng/ml), which was three orders of magnitude better than those of the traditional fiber-based F-P biosensors.

IEEE 20th International Conference on","20080121","2007","","","115","118","A system for gas phase chemical detection in harsh environments has been developed that utilizes three microplasma-based devices: pressure sensor, gas purifier, and optical emission sensor. The devices all utilize microplasmas between thin-film electrodes and occupy a combined active area of 10.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. They are fabricated on glass chips and enclosed in a 0.33 cm<sup>3</sup> ceramic package. The optical emission sensor operates by fractionating and exciting gas species for chemical spectral detection. The pressure sensor measures the change in microplasma current distribution with pressure, and achieves a sensitivity of 9800 ppm/Torr at 200degC. The gas-purifying microscale sputter ion pump purifies the environment by selectively removing nitrogen and oxygen, and achieves a 56.5times reduction in nitrogen concentration relative to helium. This purification enhances the ability to detect trace amounts of gases. As a validation of this system, a spectral enhancement of 8times at 200degC for carbon line emission intensity relative to nitrogen has been demonstrated.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433029","","Chemical sensors;Gas detectors;Nitrogen;Optical devices;Optical pumping;Optical sensors;Phase detection;Sensor systems;Stimulated emission;Thin film devices","ceramic packaging;gas sensors;microsensors;optical sensors;plasma devices;pressure sensors;spectrochemical analysis","carbon line emission intensity;ceramic package;chemical spectral detection;gas purifier;gas-phase chemical detector;gas-purifying microscale sputter ion pump;glass chip fabrication;harsh environments;microplasma current distribution;multiplasma microsystem;optical emission sensor;pressure sensor;temperature 200 C;thin-film electrodes","","3","","12","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We report for the first time that a monolithic 1-chip RF filter is achieved with the size of 2.5 mm times 2.5 mm using a suspended membrane thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) technology to meet stringent demand for miniaturization and monolithic integration of duplexers in RF communication systems.

The active micro coupler comprising air chambers, optical fiber channels, and controllable moving wall and membrane structures was fabricated by using micro electro-mechanical-systems technology. By adjusting air pressures to control the deflection of the pneumatic chambers placed orthogonal to and underneath optical fiber channels, precise alignment of buried head-on optical fibers can be achieved, which is crucial for on-line optical detection. Experimental results showed that the maximum deformation can be as high as 13 mum at an applied pressure of 40 psi for one air chamber, which is sufficient for precise coupling of two-axis optical fibers.

To actualize the idea, we designed a sensor that can measure both charge and mass of the detected gas molecules only by one device at the same time.

When interfaced with a low noise CMOS capacitance-to-voltage converter, the sensor achieves a sensing resolution of 78 mug<sub>rms</sub>/radicHz at 500 Hz with a sensitivity of 11.5 mV/g and bandwidth of 6.4 kHz. The overall system attached on umbo demonstrates the capability of detecting normal conversation.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433039","","Accelerometers;Acoustic sensors;Bandwidth;Bones;Capacitance;Ear;Humans;Micromechanical devices;Microphones;Prosthetics","ear;micromechanical devices;prosthetics;sensors","MEMS accelerometer;MEMS middle ear acoustic sensor;implantable cochlear prosthesis;implantable middle ear microphone;low noise CMOS capacitance-to-voltage converter","","2","","8","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dependence of droplet movement on the size of droplets and the rotation speed of the magnetic stirrer is studied. In order to improve the mixing efficiency, a discontinuity in the ferrofluid pattern at the mixing spots is created by adding a smaller strip magnet to the above setup. We demonstrate a reduction in the mixing time at the target spot as compared to the setup without the addition of the smaller strip magnet.

In their tiniest, ultimate realization, NEMS will be formed with sub-nanometer scale precision from atomic- and molecular-scale mechanical elements as first envisaged by Feynman (1). Although nanowire and nanotube based NEMS today verge on this domain, their assembly into functional devices remains more of an art than a science, as they are typically fabricated one-by-one by complicated means with low yield. By contrast, the most robust forms of NEMS are currently patterned by top-down methods; in fact their production is now being scaled to enable large-scale integration over 200 mm wafers with minimum feature sizes that are below 50 nm. In this paper I will describe how nanoscale mechanical elements provide benefits beyond the obvious, that is, benefits in addition to the possibility of increased device density. The reduced size of NEMS enables mechanical functionality that completely transcends what is possible at the microscale with MEMS (2). However, size reduction to the nanoscale may not be a panacea for all applications - for some applications larger may still be better!","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433022","","Biomedical engineering;Fluctuations;Frequency;Geometry;Micromechanical devices;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Nanoscale devices;Physics;Signal processing;Thermal force","microsensors;nanoelectronics","NEMS;device density;nanoelectromechanical systems","","1","","9","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rotational wings are made of cobalt-nickel alloy and rotate in an alternating magnetic field. The flight mechanism is composed of the rotational wings, non-rotational body and disk. The wings and the disk are attached to glass rod and rotate together. As the rotating frequency increases, the wings and the disk move up and the disk pushes the body upwards, and then the whole structures take off. The characteristics of the rotational wings are investigated. A scale effect is found; the characteristics of the rotational wings get better as the wing length decreases. It is considered to be caused by the wing-longitudinal flow, which is often ignored in high Reynolds number flow. The non-rotational body has soft magnetic films. Due to the magnetic anisotropic torque exerted on the films, the body can maintain its attitude stability passively. The flight mechanism that weighs 1.6 mg succeeded in taking-off at 438 Hz keeping the attitude of the body stable. The magnetic torque between the external magnetic field and the wings must be larger than the torque from the air and the friction in order to keep the wings rotating.

Bi-directionality is obtained by reversal of the actuation current thereby causing the earlier produced gasses to react back to water. This reduction of gas volume actively pulls liquid back into the system. The electrochemical actuator electrodes have been specially designed to perform the simultaneous measurement of conductivity, via which the total amount of gas can be estimated.

To solve the problem, we designed the vertical probe tip with meander structure which could provide enough displacements so that the vertical probe tips could distribute the forces acting on the tips. The structural analyses of the probe tip were accomplished using finite element method (FEM) and compared with actual measurement values. The primary fabrication processes were surface micromachining, wafer bonding technology, and electroplating. The material of the electro-plated probe tip was an Ni-Co alloy. In this study, we demonstrated the potential of the vertical probe tip that could apply to a small area with the over drive (O.D.) of 10~40 mum and the contact force of 1~8 gf.

Permanent magnets in a sandwich configuration are used to enhance RF transmission from micro-discharges. Initially, weak (field-emission) leakage current charges the floating electrode capacitor (C<sub>P</sub>ap1.1 pF) to a high voltage through the charging gap (between floating electrode and anode). When beta radiation initiates a micro-discharge in the sensing gap (between floating electrode and cathode), C<sub>P</sub> dissipates through the low impedance path, lowering the voltage and quickly quenching the discharge. Permanent magnets, positioned perpendicular to the discharge path, increase the efficiency of electron-ion collisions and enhance the consequent RF transmission. Experiments conducted in a neon/air ambient with <sup>90</sup>Sr (0.1 muCi) showed a 10times-100times SNR improvement for the 3-electrode design over a similar 2-electrode design that does not utilize the floating electrode.

It was found that the change of both height and width of mold channel were small when aspect ratio of the channel was around 1.0. Using our casting technique, an artificial butterfly wing with a spherical shape was fabricated. Our method can be applied to other plastic structures which has both a macro 3-D shape and micro details.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433147","","Biomembranes;Casting;Etching;Fabrication;Information science;Insects;Microchannel;Plastics;Shape;Silicon","biomimetics;casting;deformation;membranes;micromachining;moulding;plastics;polymer films;pressing","Parylene-C membrane;deformation estimation;flexible PDMS mold;microcasting technique;polyurethane frames;pressing process;spherical shaped butterfly wing fabrication;thermosetting plastics;thin elastic mold;thin polydimethylsiloxane mold;three-dimensional artificial insect wing;three-dimensional plastic butterfly wing fabrication","","1","","3","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A deformation of the micro-lens structure can be generated after a pressurized index-matching fluid was injected into the pneumatic side-chambers. The side-chambers can be deflected as a convex lens to focus both the laser light source and the fluorescence emission. The profile and the focal length of the micro-lens structure can be adjusted by using different applied pressures accordingly so that bio-samples with a low concentration can be detected.

IEEE 20th International Conference on","20080121","2007","","","187","190","Quasi-static numerical methods are much wider used for simulating MEMS devices as compared to full-dynamic analysis. Quasi-static models are uncomplicated to set up and have shorter simulation times. Furthermore, it is assumed that the inertia of moving masses can be neglected in MEMS devices because of their tininess. This paper investigates whether kinetic energies plays an important role in elastomechanics/electrostatics coupled-domain analysis since especially electrostatic actuators are characterized by very large actuation and thus acceleration forces. It is found that for certain actuator configurations, the dynamic behavior affects even apparently static parameters such as the pull-in threshold voltage of electrostatic actuators, especially when considering their high degree of nonlinearity. The paper identifies the most relevant device parameters and investigates their influence on the accuracy of the simulation results of quasi-static methods as compared to full-dynamic analysis. Based on these findings, the paper provides with practical guidelines on the choice of the appropriate simulation method depending on the device configuration. Moreover, the paper provides an error estimation of the simulation results obtained by quasi-static methods, using full-dynamic analysis as the reference.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4432961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432961","","Acceleration;Analytical models;Electrostatic actuators;Electrostatic analysis;Error analysis;Guidelines;Kinetic energy;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromechanical devices;Threshold voltage","elasticity;electrostatic actuators;electrostatics","acceleration forces;elastomechanics;electrostatics;error estimation;full-dynamic analysis;kinetic energies;nonlinear electrostatic MEMS actuators;pull-in threshold voltage;quasistatic simulation","","1","","5","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sucrose is applied as a protection layer for the immobilized bio-functional films during the bonding step. The bio-functional layer is composed of antibody patterns, for binding specific targets, next to polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated regions for preventing non-specific absorption. The activity of the patterned bio layer is tested, after the removal of the sucrose protection layer, utilizing fluorescent microscopy. A solution of fluorescent-labelled antigens is injected into the microchannels for incubation with the immobilized antibodies. Upon exposure to proper radiation, light is emitted only from the antibody patterns while the PEG regions remain dark. Hence, the sucrose-protection and UV-bonding techniques have not significantly compromised the functionality of the patterned antibodies, in binding to their counter receptors, and PEG molecules, in preventing non-specific adsorption, at the end of the fabrication process.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433066","","Absorption;Bonding;Coatings;Fabrication;Fluorescence;Microchannel;Polyethylene;Protection;Sugar;Testing","bonding processes;microchannel flow","PEG regions;UV-bonding techniques;antibody patterns;bio-active coatings;bio-functional layer;bonding step;fluorescent microscopy;fluorescent-labelled antigens;immobilized antibodies;immobilized bio-functional films;low-temperature UV-epoxy glass-to-silicon bonding;microchannel fabrication;nonspecific absorption;patterned bio-active layers;patterned biolayer;polyethylene glycol coated regions;sucrose protection layer","","0","","8","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This alloy was selected because it is a very promising material for use in RF-MEMS switches due to its high resistance to creep. We show that the mechanical properties of the AlCuMgMn film depend not only on the alloying components but also on the material's microstructure: grain sizes, distribution, strength and density of the precipitates, etc. We show a direct relation between the film's mechanical properties and the coherence, size and spacing of precipitates as observed by SEM and TEM in the alloy.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433103","","Alloying;Creep;Grain size;Mechanical factors;Mechanical variables measurement;Micromechanical devices;Microstructure;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Switches;System testing","aluminium compounds;copper compounds;crystal microstructure;mechanical properties;micromechanical devices;scanning electron microscopy;transmission electron microscopy","AlCuMgMn;MEMS;SEM;TEM;grain sizes;mechanical properties;micro tensile tests;microstructure;size 1.7 mum","","0","","9","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the microsystem, an anchor to easily manipulate the adults was successfully formed in the insect by placing a glass-capillary through the pupae. The pupae emerged successfully, and the microsystem was used to characterize the potential for flight control. As part of the work to determine the microplatform design, we determined the strength-interval profiles of the pulses needed for direct muscle actuation. Two sets of flight muscles, which are symmetrically present on either side of the thorax, were differentially electrically actuated, which potentially influences the individual wing beat frequency and amplitude resulting in controlled turning behavior during flight.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4432976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432976","","Actuators;Aerospace engineering;Biomedical computing;Biomedical engineering;Design engineering;Insects;Laboratories;Muscles;Payloads;Thorax","bioMEMS;muscle;zoology","flight control;insect flight muscle;metamorphosis;microprobe microsystem;muscle actuation;thorax","","10","","11","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As 3D multiple-step structured nozzles are required for straight and high frequency ink ejection, it was formed by ICP deep-RIE employing a “multiple-step mask method” which makes troublesome stereo-photolithography unnecessary and 128 nozzles/chip were fabricated simultaneously. The required thin, 2 μm-thick pressure plates were formed by B doped etch-stop technology combined with two-step alkaline etching which enables smooth-surfaced and uniform (2.15±0.35 (3 σ)μm) pressure plates. The typical driving voltage is 26.5 V and the SEAJet head has achieved the uniform ink ejection up to a driving frequency of 18 kHz. The life of the actuator has been confirmed to be more than 4 billion times actuation. The typical printing speed of the POS printer is 15 1/s (lines per second) for a rolled paper and 3 ppm (papers per min.) for A4 paper in 360 dpi (dots per inch) high resolution, a performance level that makes this the fastest inkjet POS printer in the world.

The parabolic mirrors improve the optical coupling and yield an insertion loss of only 1.4 dB even when only the normally-cleaved single mode fibers are used. The attenuation can go up to 63 dB when the mirror pair is rotated by 2.6 degrees. More importantly, a linear relationship is well maintained over the whole range, unlike the nonlinear relationship in many conventional VOAs. At the 20-dB level, the VOA measures a PDL of 0.2 dB and a WDL of 0.5 dB, which are superior to the typically values of 1-2 dB in the conventional VOAs.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433089","","Attenuation;Insertion loss;Lenses;Micromechanical devices;Mirrors;Optical attenuators;Optical coupling;Optical design;Optical losses;Packaging","attenuated total reflection;micro-optics;mirrors;optical attenuators;optical couplers","MEMS;insertion loss;linear attenuation relationship;optical coupling;parabolic mirror;retro-reflection VOA;retro-reflector;rod lens;single mode fibers;variable optical attenuator","","2","","15","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is based on a micromachined print head incorporating a central microarray of presently up to 96 vertical nozzles on the output side. Droplets featuring volumes down to 1nl aligned in a 500 μm grid are simultaneously ejected by applying a steep air pressure ramp to the open upper side of the liquid. Each of these nozzles is connected to a distinct fluidic reservoir constituting the interface to the macro world. To allow an automated replenishing of the chip, the alignment of the reservoirs is amenable for liquid handling via standard pipetting robots. Depending on the design of the print head, a maximum of 20 μl can be stored thus allowing one to dispend about 20.000 droplets of equal quality in a row. Besides its suitability for a robust biochip manufacturing facility in the laboratory, the print head is also well-integrable in a high-throughput production plant.

Flow visualization was carried out to understand the boiling mechanism in such a system. Three phase-change modes were observed depending on the input power level. Local nucleation boiling within the microchannels occurred at low power level. At moderate levels, large bubbles developed at the inlet/outlet regions, and the upstream bubbles were forced through the channels and out of the system.

The CNTs were directly synthesized between the Si beam and the bottom Si layer (bridging CNTs) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). After we synthesized bridging CNTs on the structure, we infiltrated and cured the PDMS prepolymer solution (polydimethylsiloxane) on the surface of the beam structure and the bridging CNTs, so that we can detect force without any damage to the sensing element. As a result, the electrical resistance of the bridging CNTs changes by 3.2% for a 4.9 N force applied on the beam.

In addition to confirming a previously observed nonlinear relationship with applied electric field following the Biased Reptation with Fluctuations Model, the mobility dependence on DNA size and pillar spacing is characterized and discussed. Similar to conventional slab-gel electrophoresis, short DNA molecules have higher migration mobility. However, a ""band inversion""-like phenomenon is observed for larger DNA molecules. The pillar array significantly affects the electric field distribution in the separation channel and, consequently, the resulting mobility. Although this leads to a higher mobility in more closely packed pillars, excessive reduction of the pillar spacing generates a large retarding force.

Because the reagents are encapsulated in oil, the evaporation rate is greatly reduced, and only small amount of reagents are required. The microchamber size and reagent amount are digitally controlled by the number of ejected oil and reagent droplets, respectively.

Indeed, both the UV-visible spectrum and X-ray diffraction of a protein crystal enclosed in a PDMS device are almost identical to those of the crystal alone. Hence, PDMS is suitable as substrate material in device fabrication to study protein crystals.

The core of the sensor is a silicon chip with a thin membrane (600times600times0.9 mum<sup>3</sup>) containing a heater as well as a thermopile for temperature detection. The membrane has a very low heat capacity and is cooled down with a Peltier-cooler located underneath the membrane. When the dew point of the surrounding water vapor is reached, water begins to condense on the membrane and changes its heat capacity. This change in heat capacity is detected by dynamically heating the membrane and recording its temperature response by using the thermopiles. Two different types of the sensor were developed and characterized. Based on a first configuration, dew point temperatures down to 45 K below ambient temperature can be measured with a maximum deviation of < 0.2 K. This configuration is optimized for the detection of residual moisture in technical gases. The second configuration was designed to measure dew point temperatures in the high humidity range of up to 100% relative humidity (RH) for climate control applications.

Contact force on the sensor is detected by measuring the capacitance change at the intersection of two intersected fibers. The sensor detects the 2D contact-force distribution by sequentially scanning the capacitances at all fiber intersection points.

The S/N ratio increases with downsizing the width of the stripe electrode because the noise current exponentially decreases. The nano stripe electrode with 450 nm in width and 15 mum in the center-to-center separation of the electrode could achieve 17.15 times higher S/N ratio than that of a planar electrode having the same corresponding area size.

Fascin, a putative bundling protein, tightly bundles several F-actins together to form tight bundles of actin [1]. When G-actin and the fascin solution was confined and polymerized in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or parylene micro chambers, we found that the polymerized actin bundles followed the geometry of chambers, and then formed several shapes, such as circles, rods, triangles or squares.

The deposition thickness of nanometer-thin SiC coating was optimized to provide enhanced corrosion resistance to silicon MEMS without compromising the electrical and mechanical performance of the original device. The coated DETF achieves a strain resolution of 0.2 mue in a 10 Hz to 20 kHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the uncoated device. The coated DETF is locally heated with an IR lamp and is shown to operate up to 190 degC in air with a temperature sensitivity of -7.6 Hz/degC. The devices are also dipped in KOH at 80 degC for 5 minutes without etching the structures, confirming the poly-SiC coating provides a sufficient chemical barrier to the underlying silicon. The results demonstrate that SiC-coated poly-Si devices are an effective bridge between poly-Si and full poly-SiC films for applications requiring a high level of corrosion resistance and moderate operating temperatures (up to 200 degC) without compromising the performance characteristics of the original poly-Si device.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433166","","Capacitive sensors;Coatings;Corrosion;Foundries;Mechanical sensors;Micromechanical devices;Nanoscale devices;Resonance;Silicon carbide;Vibrations","coatings;corrosion resistance;micromechanical devices;potassium compounds;silicon compounds;strain sensors;wide band gap semiconductors","Bosch commercial foundry;IR lamp;KOH;MEMS strain sensor;SiC;corrosion resistance;double-ended tuning fork;poly-silicon carbide coating;resonant strain sensor;temperature 80 C;time 5 min","","2","","11","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The directional pattern is realized by using an interference effect. An ultrasonic wave is emitted from electrodes on the nc-PS layer according to the applied electrical current. The emission areas of the transmitter were patterned in order to use the interference between the emitted ultrasonic waves. To observe the interference effect, our device was designed to have two emission areas. The directional pattern induced by the interference effect depends on the distance between the emission areas, and the frequency and the phase difference of the currents applied to the emission areas. We confirmed that the sharpness and the lobe number of the directional pattern can be changed by the phase difference between two emission areas. We also confirmed that the direction of the main lobe can be changed by the phase difference. With the characteristics of the designable and controllable directional pattern, the proposed device is suitable for distance sensors, especially for proximity sensors.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-095-5","978-1-4244-095-5","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4433011","","Acoustic emission;Acoustic sensors;Electrodes;Frequency;Interference;Mechanical sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Silicon;Transmitters;Vibrations","distance measurement;interference (wave);nanostructured materials;porous materials;sensors;silicon;ultrasonic devices;ultrasonic transmission","Si;interference effect;nanocrystalline porous silicon ultrasonic transmitter;patterned emission;proximity sensor;ultrasonic wave;variable directional pattern","","1","","5","","","21-25 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was found that blasting with 9 μm particles (compared with 30 μm particles) result in a higher slope of the channel sidewall. The aspect ratio of powder blasted channels was increased by using the high resistance of the copper mask in combination with the use of 9 μm particles.

A diaphragm (6 mm×6 mm×0.15 mm) was etched on the Si side for oscillation. The ultrasonic vibration originated from a bulk piezoelectric PZT ceramic (5 mm×4 mm×0.15 mm), which was excited by a 60 kHz square wave at 50 V (peak-to-peak). Liquids were mixed in a chamber (6 mm×6 mm×0.06 mm) with the Si oscillating diaphragm driven by the PZT. A solution of uranine and water were used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness.

The damping force is caused by viscous friction of the gas film between a moving mirror plate and the electrodes. The grooves decrease the damping force and enable the moving plate to be driven at high speed and low driving voltage. To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves. For that purpose, the idea of hydraulic mean depth is introduced and is applied to the Reynolds equation. The calculated damping force shows good agreement with the measured damping force of the developed torsion mirror actuator for optical heads","1084-6999","0-7803-5273-4","","10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838559","","Damping;Electrodes;Electrostatic actuators;Electrostatic analysis;Equations;Force measurement;Friction;High speed optical techniques;Low voltage;Mirrors","damping;electrostatic devices;friction;micro-optics;mirrors;viscosity","Reynolds equation;air-film viscosity;damping characteristics;damping force;deep grooves;driving voltage;gas film;hydraulic mean depth;micro electrostatic torsion mirror;moving mirror plate;optical heads;sidewalls;torsion mirror actuator;viscous friction","","0","","10","","","23-27 Jan 2000","23 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A biaxial tensile tester designed for film specimens was employed to apply uni/biaxial stresses to SCS specimen having 270-nm-high, 4-mum-square SCS convex structures in the gauge section. As reported in Transducers 2007, two-curve fitting of Raman spectrum was useful for analyzing stress magnitude at the edge of convex structures. In this study, the partial least-square (PLS) method was adopted for the obtained Raman spectra at the convex edge in order to determine stress components as well as their magnitudes. By using the PLS method, the shear stress component was able to be measured in addition to the normal stress components. The stress magnitude in respective stress components was in very good agreement with that estimated by finite element analysis (FEA).","1084-6999","978-1-4244-2977-6","978-1-4244-2978-3","10.1109/MEMSYS.2009.4805468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4805468","","Microstructure;Raman scattering;Silicon;Spectroscopy;Stress measurement;Surface emitting lasers;Surface fitting;Tensile stress;Testing;Transducers","Raman spectroscopy;elemental semiconductors;finite element analysis;least squares approximations;micromechanical devices;reliability;silicon","Si;biaxial tensile tester;finite element analysis;laser Raman spectroscope;nondestructive quantitative measurement;normal stress;partial least-square method;reliability;shear stress;silicon-MEMS;single-crystalline silicon microstructures;single-crystalline silicon structures;surface stress distribution","","1","","5","","","25-29 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So it is essential for MG that services can be discovered efficiently. Automatic semantic and IR based approach of service discovery within a semantic manufacturing grid (SMG) architecture is studied in this paper. In SMG, services and job requirements are semantically described by a merged ontology of grid service ontology and manufacturing ontology. Service discovery is formalized as matchmaking between a job and advertised services. All kinds of degree of match (DoM) are formally defined considering both semantic match and document similarity. Then, a hybrid semantic and IR based matchmaking algorithm is presented. A SMG prototype system used for collaborative MEMS manufacturing has been built, in which a semantic service registry named UDDIe4SMG is built by extending UDDI and specially designed for efficient service discovery. Experiments show that the automatic service discovery approach in SMG works well and has good performance.","","0-7695-3007-9","978-0-7695-3007-9","10.1109/SKG.2007.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438587","","Collaborative work;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Manufacturing automation;OWL;Ontologies;Prototypes;Pulp manufacturing;Semantic Web;Web services","Web services;grid computing;information retrieval;intelligent manufacturing systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","automatic service discovery;collaborative MEMS manufacturing;information retrieval;micro electro-mechanical system;ontology;semantic manufacturing grid service;semantic service registry","","0","","7","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The joint features in the micropart and MEMS chip are aligned with a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, the MEMS chip is placed in a lower position than that of the reoriented micropart. The positions in x-y plane (parallel with the focal plane of microscope) of the joint features are determined with pattern matching method. Visual servo control is employed to align the joint features in two different parallel planes with sub-micron accuracy. In the second stage, the joint features are aligned in the z direction (along the optical axis of the microscope) with assistance of vision. The contact status of joint features is detected with the gray value of the image in the surrounding area of the tips of micropart, which changes due to the deflection of the joint feature.

A tuning range of 900 nm with linewidths of 210 nm have been achieved for the MWIR, while maintaining a relatively low tuning voltage of 17 V.","","978-1-4244-0641-8","","10.1109/OMEMS.2007.4373878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373878","HgCdTe;Optical MEMS;infrared;microspectrometer","Electromagnetic spectrum;Fabry-Perot;Infrared detectors;Infrared spectra;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Monolithic integrated circuits;Optical device fabrication;Optical filters;Temperature","infrared detectors;infrared spectrometers;integrated optics;micro-optics;microsensors;optical filters","HgCdTe;HgCdTe-based infrared detector;MEMS Fabry-Perot filter;MWIR microspectrometer;SWIR microspectrometers;electromagnetic spectrum;infrared sensor;microelectro-mechanical systems;mid-wavelength infrared region;parallel plate MEMS optical filter;short-wavelength infrared region;temperature control;tunable optical filters;voltage 17 V;wavelength 210 nm;wavelength 900 nm","","0","","2","","","Aug. 12 2007-July 16 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All-optical integrated circuits could be possible to fabricate using photonic crystals. Several tunable PC's have been reported. One of the best methods which may cause a stronger effect and a larger tuning range is using MEMS structure. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) actuators can physically insert defect in the channel and change the output power. In this paper, we present numerical analysis for a MEMS actuated photonic crystal switch by finite difference time domain (FDTD) method at telecommunications wavelength (~1550 nm). The ON-OFF switching is achieved by inserting MEMS actuators and changing the defect. We have determined the ratio of the E-field amplitude at the end to the input of the channel which is desirable in switch applications. The effect of changing the radius of air holes and actuator rods on switching performance has also been investigated. Using a dielectric plate instead of rods as a new structure has been introduced and simulated.","","1-4244-1005-3","1-4244-1005-3","10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284166","","Actuators;Finite difference methods;Micromechanical devices;Numerical analysis;Photonic crystals;Photonic integrated circuits;Switches;Telecommunication switching;Time domain analysis;Tunable circuits and devices","finite difference time-domain analysis;microactuators;optical communication equipment;optical switches;photonic crystals;telecommunication switching","MEMS;actuated photonic crystal switch;actuator rods;air holes;dielectric plate;finite difference time domain method;micro-electro-mechanical systems;switching performance;telecommunications wavelength","","0","","8","","","2-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The barriers, for the attitude control of these satellites, are the less mass and the less power budget. Hence, the normal attitude sensors and actuators cannot be used. The attitude control system of the micro and nano satellites relies on a novel technology known as Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. In this paper, use of high temperature superconductor (HTS) magnet momentum wheel has been proposed for the attitude control system of micro and nano satellites and the design, working principles and the mathematical model of the HTS momentum wheel are elaborated.

There is a 7times7 array of magnets in a unit. The PDMS diaphragm is 2 mmtimes2 mmtimes40 mum and the magnet post is 50 mumtimes50 mumtimes20 mum. Computer simulation is applied to optimize the geometrical parameters. Electro-plating under external magnetic field is carried out to improve the magnetic properties of the electroplated magnet, including coercivity, remanence and magnetic energy and so on. The measured maximum coercivity, remanence and maximum magnetic energy are 2623 Oe(208.73 kA/m), 0.2 T(2000 G) 3 and 10.15 kJ/m with the magnet post respectively. Moreover,the deflection of the PDMS membrane is proportional to the exciting current. In a case of 0.35 A current, the maximum deflection of the membrane is 45 mum. Adjusting the electroplating mold results in the variation of the electroplated structure, thus the calibration of the microactuaor.

However, in this paper it is concluded that thickness control of the oxidation layer has a major influence on the absolute frequency, besides on the temperature drift, and as such dominates the frequency spread of a MEMS resonator after production including oxidation. This is a result of the large difference in Young's modulus of Si and SiO<sub>2</sub> and the added mass due to oxidation.

The emphasis on packaging (as opposed to assembly) is inclusive of the latter, but it also recognizes that bonding, sealing and attachment processes must also be controlled, and will greatly influence the reliability of the microsystem. The system components include precision robots, microstages, end-effectors and fixtures that accomplish assembly tasks in a shared workspace.

The network sensing systems connect various sensors by wire in order to collect information measured by each sensor. Although, the wired connection causes certain restrictions regarding with the system installation. Consequently, many kinds of research on wireless sensor network systems have been developed. However, almost all commercialized products utilize a battery as the power source. But, the battery exchange process is needed and therefore the setting condition is restricted, again. Furthermore, the management cost of the battery is troublesome. In order to solve these problems, we have proposed the wireless network sensing system with sensor modules with MEMS sensor and without battery by applying the RFID system for power transmittance. Based on this concept, the unique sensor module SNA-MEMS (smart nano micro electro mechanical systems) is developed for the demonstration. This module is driven by the electric power converted from radio wave at the in-module circuit to realize the battery-less concept by following the RFID standard, ISO 15693 13.56 MHz. The demo-model has a piezoresistive 3-axes MEMS acceleration sensor and consists of eight 1cm x 1 cm ceramic boards those are stacked vertically. Each board is connected to the next boards by soldering between through-hole bus located on outer rim of each board.

Owing to the random errors that exist in the MEMS sensors, the accuracy of the position estimate degrades with time. Although Kalman filtering algorithm provides a good navigation tracking solution, its accuracy depends on the amount of position information given about the target. In vehicles, the global positioning system (GPS) can be used to augment an IMU with absolute position information and improve its tracking accuracy. However, due to indoor-usage and a higher accuracy requirement, the GPS is not suitable for updating a mulMU used for hand-motion tracking with absolute position information. In this paper, we propose a novel position estimation method which makes use of an electromagnetic resonance (EMR) motion detection board for position information to improve the tracking accuracy of a mulMU-based digital writing instrument. The EMR board cannot provide high resolution (only 3 cm per grid in our case) position information for a large writing area because of high construction cost and poor tracking performance. However, the combined scheme of using the mulMU and the EMR board can compensate their respective weaknesses. The EMR board can bound the mulMU position estimate error and the mulMU can provide detailed information of the handwriting trajectory for the rough locus obtained from the EMR board. Details of the estimation algorithm will be discussed and experimental results of its implementation are compared with the conventional Kalman filtering without the extra position feedback information.","","978-1-4244-1761-2","978-1-4244-1758-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522191","Digital Writing Instrument;Error Compensation;Human Motion Sensing;Kalman Filtering;MEMS μIMU","Accelerometers;Electromagnetic coupling;Electromagnetic radiation;Instruments;Kalman filters;Micromechanical devices;Motion detection;Resonance;Target tracking;Writing","Kalman filters;feedback;interactive devices;microsensors;position control","Kalman filtering;MEMS sensors;coupled micro inertial measurement unit;electromagnetic resonance motion detection;handwriting tracking;position feedback information;ubiquitous digital writing instrument system","","0","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
