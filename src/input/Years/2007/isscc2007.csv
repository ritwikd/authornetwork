IEEE International","20070618","2007","","","31","37","Gone forever, are the days of smooth roadmap scaling, with its more-or-less-simple design rules, adequate supply voltages, and unimpeded circuit shrinkage. As scaling moved ahead to nanometer dimensions, things changed. Devices became more difficult to predict, and global performance degraded due to leakage and dispersion. One of the consequences of this deteriorating situation has been that increased parameter variability has led to a significant mismatch between simulation and actual-measurement results, at all levels. While many of these effects have been already well-known to analog designers, the surprise, now, is that they are more broadly important, even in digital design, where previously available noise margins have almost disappeared. Clearly, deep understanding and modeling of all underlying physical causes is urgently required to guide the right choices at all levels. Conceptually, such understanding will lead to acceptable levels of performance, manufacturability, and yield, at ever-decreasing feature sizes. Meanwhile, the increased parameter variability observed today, as one technology node invites the next, reveals the tight coupling of the four seemingly- independent dimensions of design, motivating the need to configure a new nano-cosmology, one in which global optimization results only from an intricate balance between the process, device, circuit, and system aspects of design. In this new nano-cosmology, the emerging concept of generalized design-for-manufacturability (GDfM) unifies current design-for-manufacturability (DfM), manufacturing-for-design (MfD), and design-for-yield (DfY), coupling all of the above-mentioned dimensions within a new space where their inter-dependence is revealed and exploited. Tightly-coupled physical-electrical-mechanical-process modeling and simulation, will allow early detection of the impact of design choices at all levels. This creates a 4D knowledge continuum reminiscent of the ideas of general relativity, ones e- xtremely rich in consequences for the future of nanoelectronic design.","0193-6530","1-4244-0853-9","1-4244-0853-9","10.1109/ISSCC.2007.373575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4242252","","Batteries;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Circuits;Degradation;Germanium silicon alloys;Silicon germanium;Temperature;Threshold voltage;Tunneling","design for manufacture;nanoelectronics","4D knowledge continuum;circuit shrinkage;design for manufacturability;design for yield;manufacturing for design;nanoelectronic cosmology;nanoelectronic design;noise margins;parameter variability","","9","","35","","","11-15 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International","20070618","2007","","","18","23","The dedicated-foundry industry was established in 1987, with the incorporation of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Silicon-wafer production at foundries has increased significantly since that time, to account for over 20% of all wafer volume. Foundries are now an integral part of the overall semiconductor supply-chain. There is every reason to anticipate that the importance of the foundry industry will increase further. The authors believe that the foundry business-model is an important positive influence on the health of the overall IC industry. Accordingly, it is critically necessary to scan the future for potential issues that might inhibit foundry-industry growth. The foundry company must develop strategies to avoid commoditization. In our opinion, one of the most important aspects of the foundry response to commoditization must be to create a much deeper and broader relationship between the foundry and each of its customers. This new type of integrated relationship differs from many previous foundry-customer relationships, in that both design and technology engineering proceed concurrently from an early stage in the product-development effort. Note that the success of this relationship will require a much greater information flow between the design and foundry teams, and optimization of both design and process technology to meet product requirements. Such relationships can offer a significant advantage to customers in meeting product-cost, performance, and time-to-market requirements.","0193-6530","1-4244-0853-9","1-4244-0853-9","10.1109/ISSCC.2007.373573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4242250","","Business;CMOS technology;Companies;Costs;Electronics industry;Foundries;Manufacturing;Production;Semiconductor device manufacture;Silicon","foundries;integrated circuit manufacture;supply chains;technological forecasting","CMOS logic circuits;IC industry;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company;cost reduction;dedicated silicon foundry industry;foundry business-model;foundry-customer relationships;integrated circuits industry;product development;semiconductor supply-chain;wafer production","","2","","7","","","11-15 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20070618","2007","","","24","30","Innovation in analog and mixed-signal electronics becomes increasingly more important to the continued growth of the IC industry. Technologists working in the analog and mixed-signal arena certainly share, with their digital counterparts, the overarching goal of reducing power and cost-per-function in each IC generation. But they must also operate under physical constraints that, until recently, have been secondary in the digital world. From the advent of the first analog IC, analog designers have exploited the potential of the process technology to develop circuits that minimize the impact of variation in process parameters on product performance. The bandgap reference is just one example. More generally, trim, calibration, and circuit techniques such as charge-redistribution, enabled economic production of amplifiers and data converters with 12-bits (or better) precision on ""8-bit"" processes. In addition, while process scaling has enabled the development of a wide variety of products, from cell-phones to advanced medical-imaging systems, the success of these products depends in large measure on their ease of use, and seamless connection to wireless and wired networks. Analog and mixed-signal subsystems, including display drivers, and WLAN and cellular radios, support these critical interfaces. The downward scaling of supply voltage in deep-submicron CMOS (now at 1V), may limit dynamic range, forcing some analog functions to be implemented on other processes, but it has also enabled new circuit architectures that gain back dynamic range. The creative combination of process, design, and system architecture in providing robust solutions for demanding applications, will prove to be even more crucial in the future. Such solutions will be essential in meeting the challenges posed by the physical realities of deep-submicron design in achieving gigahertz speeds, minimizing power- consumption, and integrating multiple functions in smaller packages.","0193-6530","1-4244-0853-9","1-4244-0853-9","10.1109/ISSCC.2007.373574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4242251","","Analog integrated circuits;Calibration;Digital integrated circuits;Dynamic range;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Photonic band gap;Power generation;Power generation economics;Technological innovation","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;data conversion;integrated circuit design;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","12 bit;8 bit;CMOS technology;analog electronics;bandgap reference;cellular radios;data converters;deep-submicron design;display drivers;mixed-signal electronics;process scaling;wireless LAN","","5","","36","","","11-15 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The always-on nature of the WuRx sets a power dissipation floor for the entire system. In realistic WSN scenarios, the adoption of a WuRx leads to energy savings only if it can be realized with about 50muW of power dissipation in Lin, E.Y., et al, (2004), testing the limits of low-power receiver design. While diode detectors provide for the simplest detector structure, such receivers are strongly gain-limited due to the thresholding effect of the nonlinear detector in Pletcher, N., et al, (2007) and adding gain at RF to improve sensitivity only increases power consumption. A more attractive approach is to adopt a heterodyne architecture, where the extra gain needed for robust energy detection can be obtained at an intermediate frequency (IF) with a much lower power cost. However, a survey of previous receiver designs for WSN reveals that the power requirements of the required local oscillator (LO) exceed the total power budget of the WuRx in Otis, B., et al, (2005).","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523288","","Delay;Energy dissipation;Envelope detectors;Power dissipation;Radio frequency;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","heterodyne detection;low-power electronics;oscillators;radio receivers;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","data transceiver sleep time;diode detectors;energy dissipation;heterodyne architecture;intermediate frequency;local oscillator;low-power receiver design;network latency;nonlinear detector;power consumption;power dissipation floor;uncertain-IF architecture;wake-up receiver;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic detection","","34","4","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a subretinal light sensitive chip, the natural optical system of the eye is still used, allowing the patient to intuitively locate objects. The patient was 1 out of 7, who have been implanted in a clinical study in 2006 in Tuebingen, Germany (E. Zrenner et al., 2007). The space beneath the retina is limited. Either just an electrode array is placed there (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), or a silicon chip thinned to about 70mum, or both. The experiments (E. Zrenner et al., 2007) used a device including a light-sensitive CMOS chip and separate direct stimulation electrodes. The device was connected to an external power supply by a polyimide-ribbon (comparable to (L. Theogarajan et al., 2006), however much longer), forming a flexible connection into the eyeball. Feasibility of the wired supply approach for humans was proven; no perception of the ribbon was reported by the patients.

An innovative approach for write-margin extraction has recently been published at the ISSCC'2006 conference. This approach makes use of test structure giving access to internal node. Here, this approach is evaluated through our 65 nm process and it is shown that the layout and probing of the innovative test structure induces a write delay. As a consequence an adaptation of this innovative methodology is proposed.

However, when the comparator determines in first instance the overall performance, as in most SAR ADCs, comparator thermal noise can limit the maximum achievable resolution. More than 1 and 2 ENOB reductions are observed in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007) and Kuttner, F., (2002), respectively, because of thermal noise, and degradations could be even worse with scaled supply voltages and the extensive use of dynamic regenerative latches without pre-amplification. Unlike mismatch, random noise cannot be compensated by calibration and would finally demand a quadratic increase in power consumption unless alternative circuit techniques are devised.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523145","","Adders;Calibration;Energy consumption;Error correction;Frequency conversion;Phase noise;Phased arrays;Sampling methods;Solid state circuits;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits);flip-flops;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;thermal noise","ENOB reductions;SAR architectures;analog/mixed-signal design;battery-powered devices;comparator thermal noise;digital CMOS;dynamic regenerative latches;noise-tolerant dynamic-SAR ADC;power consumption;random noise;supply voltages","","21","11","6","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver with modal-dispersion equalizer for 10Gb/s 500m MMF transmission","Watanabe, D.; Ono, A.; Okayasu, T.","Advantest, Gunma, Japan","Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers, 2009. ISSCC 2009. IEEE International","20090529","2009","","","106","107,107a","Data communication over 300 m of distance, such as Ethernet standards, where the required data rate per channel reaches 10 Gb/s or more, demand optical transmission. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and multimode optical fiber (MMF) are usually used in such optical transmission systems, because they offer several advantages such as ease of assembly and optical alignment for cost reduction. The modulation frequency of commercial VCSEL devices is limited to approximately 10 GHz. To overcome this limitation, solutions have been reported by Palermo et al. (2006, 2007). However, these papers merely describe that the modulation frequency of VCSEL can be extended by equalization. On the other hand, the transmission performance of MMF is generally defined by the product of transmission distance and modulation frequency. In a commercial graded-index (Gl) MMF, the transmission performance stays about 500 MHz-km due to modal dispersion. In the case of 10 Gb/s data transmission, the required bandwidth for transmission medium is 10 GHz or more. Therefore, when using these commercial Gl MMF, the transmission distance will be limited to 50 m. Thus, when several hundred meters of transmission is achieved using MMF, the modal dispersion of MMF becomes a rather predominant transmission bottleneck than the use of VCSEL. To overcome this bottleneck, a 4-PAM VCSEL driver with an equalization scheme to compensate the modal dispersion of MMF is described in this paper. The driver is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS and achives 10 Gb/s 500 m 4-PAM transmission using conventional MMF having a 500 MHz-km of transmission bandwidth. Using this driver, the transmission distance with 10 Gb/s is extended by 10times (5 GHz-km).","","978-1-4244-3458-9","","10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4977330","","Bandwidth;Communication standards;Data communication;Equalizers;Ethernet networks;Fiber lasers;Frequency modulation;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical modulation;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","CMOS integrated circuits;data communication equipment;driver circuits;equalisers;gradient index optics;integrated optoelectronics;optical fibre communication;optical fibre dispersion;optical modulation;pulse amplitude modulation;surface emitting lasers","CMOS optical 4-PAM VCSEL driver fabrication;MMF transmission;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;data communication;data transmission;distance 500 m;equalization scheme;graded-index MMF;modal dispersion;modal-dispersion equalizer;multimode optical fiber;optical transmission system;pulse amplitude modulation;size 90 nm;vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser","","2","","6","","","8-12 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several implementations have been developed ((Y. W. Huang, et al., 2005), (H.C. Chang, et al., 2007), (T.C. Chen, et al., 2007)), but, their performance is limited to baseline 720p (Y. W. Huang, et al., 2005),(H.C. Chang, et al., 2007) or SDTV (T.C. Chen, et al., 2007). The main stream 1080p high-profile application presents a series of new design challenges in throughput, cost and power because of at least a 4x higher complexity than in the 720p baseline. Thus, a 0.13mum 1080p high-profile H.264 video encoder is presented with 10mm<sup>2</sup> core and 242 mW power. Compared to a state-of-the-art 720p baseline design (H.C. Chang, et al., 2007), this design achieves a 46.7% and 54% reduction in area and power, respectively. These savings are from parallelism enhanced throughput and a cross-stage sharing pipeline.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523183","","Automatic voltage control;Circuits;Costs;Energy consumption;Frequency;HDTV;Hardware;Motion estimation;Testing;Throughput","digital signal processing chips;discrete cosine transforms;motion estimation;video coding","H.264/AVC high-profile encoder chip;discrete cosine transform;fractional motion estimation;integer motion estimation;nonsampling reference memory sharing;power 242 mW;video encoder","","4","","5","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digest of Technical Papers. IEEE International","20090304","2008","","","454","627","DLL clock multipliers outperform their PLL counterparts in terms of phase noise because they have significantly less jitter accumulation [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002; P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007; S. Ye and I. Galton, 2004]. Figure 25.2.1 shows the basic PLL and recirculating DLL. In the latter, the oscillator loop is periodically opened to let in a ""clean"" reference edge. It avoids the pattern jitter due to delay-stage mismatch as seen normally in an edge-combining DLL. The remaining pattern jitter is due to static phase offset of the phase detector (PD)/charge pump (CP). This offset transfers to a phase discontinuity between the two edges that are substituted for one another [P.C. Maulik and D.A. Mercer, 2007]. As a result the clock spectrum shows severe reference spurs, as high as -37dBc in [R. Farjad-Rad et al., 2002]. This is especially undesirable in applications like ADCs where clock spurs convolute with the spectrum of the input signal. By contrast, in a PLL, static phase offset introduces no direct phase discontinuity in the output clock. Nevertheless, it still causes a periodic ripple across the loop filter that modulates the oscillator. By tightening the filter, the ripple is filtered more, lowering the reference spur. However, this reduces loop bandwidth leading to less suppression of oscillator phase noise.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523253","","Charge pumps;Clocks;Delay;Detectors;Filters;Jitter;Oscillators;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Phase noise","clocks;frequency multipliers;jitter;multiplying circuits;phase locked loops;phase locked oscillators","PLL;charge pump;clock multiplier;clock spectrum;delay-stage mismatch;frequency 200 kHz;frequency 800 MHz;loop filter;oscillator loop;oscillator phase noise suppression;pattern jitter;phase detector;phase discontinuity;phase locked loops;phase noise because;static phase offset","","8","2","3","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The combination of non-volatile attributes of flash, RAM-like bit-alterability, and fast reads and writes position PCM to enable changes in the memory subsystems of cellular phones, PCs and countless embedded and consumer electronics applications. This design's multi-level cell (MLC) capabilities combined with long- term scalability reduce PCM costs as only realized before by hard disk drives. MLC technology is challenged with fitting more cell states (4 in the case of 2 bit per cell), along with distribution spreads due to process, design, and environmental variations, within a limited window. We describe a 256Mb MLC test-chip in a 90nm micro-trench (mutrench) PCM technology, and MLC endurance results from an 8Mb 0.18mum PCM test-chip with the same trench cell structure. A program algorithm achieving tightly placed inner states and experimental results illustrating distinct current distributions are presented to demonstrate MLC capability.","","978-1-4244-2010-0","978-1-4244-2011-7","10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4523240","","Cellular phones;Consumer electronics;Nonvolatile memory;Personal communication networks;Phase change materials;Phase change memory;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Scalability;Testing","flash memories;phase change materials;random-access storage","MLC technology;RAM;current distributions;flash memories;memory subsystems;micro-trench PCM technology;multilevel cell technology;phase-change memory;size 0.18 mum;size 90 nm;storage capacity 8 Mbit;trench cell structure","","24","8","10","","","3-7 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
