In-order delivery, resource utilization, and latency are the most critical issues in such architectures. In this paper, we present a novel network interface architecture to cope with these issues efficiently. The proposed network interface exploits a resourceful reordering mechanism to handle the in-order delivery and to increase the resource utilization. A brilliant memory controller is efficiently integrated into this network interface to improve the memory utilization and reduce both memory and network latencies. In addition, to bring compatibility with existing IP cores the proposed network interface utilizes AXI transaction based protocol. Experimental results with synthetic test cases demonstrate that the proposed architecture gives significant improvements in average network latency (12%), average memory access latency (19%), and average memory utilization (22%).","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507556","","Access protocols;Delay;Information technology;Network interfaces;Network-on-a-chip;Resource management;Routing;Scalability;System-on-a-chip;Testing","DRAM chips;multiprocessing systems;network interfaces;network-on-chip","AXI transaction based protocol;in-order delivery;latency;memory parallelism;multiple SDRAMs;multiprocessing system-on-chip;network interface architecture;network-on-chip;on-chip network;resource utilization;resourceful reordering mechanism","","18","","26","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Ultra Fine-Grained Run-Time Power Gating of On-chip Routers for CMPs","Matsutani, H.; Koibuchi, M.; Ikebuchi, D.; Usami, K.; Nakamura, H.; Amano, H.","Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","Networks-on-Chip (NOCS), 2010 Fourth ACM/IEEE International Symposium on","20100712","2010","","","61","68","This paper proposes an ultra fine-grained run-time power gating of on-chip router, in which power supply to each router component (e.g., VC queue, crossbar MUX, and output latch) can be individually controlled in response to the applied workload. As only the router components which are just transferring a packet are activated, the leakage power of the on-chip network can be reduced to the near-optimal level. However, a certain amount of wakeup latency is required to activate the sleeping components, and the application performance will be degraded. In this paper, we estimate the wakeup latency for each component based on circuit simulations using a 65 nm process. Then we propose four early wakeup methods to overcome the wakeup latency. The proposed router with the early wakeup methods is evaluated in terms of the application performance, area, and leakage power. As a result, it reduces the leakage power by 78.9%, at the expense of the 4.3% area and 4.0% performance when we assume a 1 GHz operation.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507560","Network-on-Chip;low power;power gating;router","Communication switching;Costs;Degradation;Delay;Energy consumption;Latches;Network-on-a-chip;Power supplies;Runtime;Virtual colonoscopy","multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;optimisation;power aware computing","CMP;chip multiprocessors;circuit simulations;onchip network;onchip routers;ultra fine grained runtime power gating","","10","","14","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, since CPUs have to be relieved of communication management, higher communication levels such as DMA engines necessarily influence the communication performance. In this paper, we investigate how two different DMA implementations, full-duplex and half-duplex, can bias the behavior of a NoC designed for MPP architectures. From our studies, it turned out that a full-duplex DMA is more effective in preventing possible deadlock situations. Moreover, a deep performance analysis of a state-of-the-art NoC, in terms of transactions completion time, queuing time and injection delay, confirms the impact of the DMA in NoC-based MPP platforms, showing the advantages of a full-duplex approach.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507541","DMA performance bias;deadlock prevention;full-duplex DMA;half-duplex DMA;hybrid switching NoC","Computer architecture;Delay effects;Engines;ISO;Network-on-a-chip;Open systems;Performance analysis;Queueing analysis;System recovery;Tiles","file organisation;network-on-chip;open systems;parallel processing","ISO OSI micro network stack;NoC performance;completion time transaction;direct memory access;full duplex DMA implementations;half duplex DMA implementation;massively parallel processors;networks on chip;queuing time","","0","","17","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Buffers are needed in routers to house incoming flits which cannot be immediately forwarded due to contention. This buffering can be done at the inputs or the outputs of a router, corresponding to an input-buffered router (IBR) or an output-buffered router (OBR). OBRs are attractive because they can sustain higher throughputs and have lower queuing delays under high loads than IBRs. However, a direct implementation of an OBR requires a router speedup equal to the number of ports, making such a design prohibitive under aggressive clocking needs and limited power budgets of most NoC applications. In this paper, we propose a new router design that aims to emulate an OBR practically, based on a distributed shared-buffer (DSB) router architecture. We introduce innovations to address the unique constraints of NoCs, including efficient pipelining and novel flow-control. We also present practical DSB configurations that can reduce the power overhead with negligible degradation in performance. The proposed DSB router achieves up to 19% higher throughput on synthetic traffic and reduces packet latency by 60% on average for SPLASH-2 benchmarks with high contention, compared to a state-of-art pipelined IBR. On average, the saturation throughput of DSB routers is within 10% of the theoretically ideal saturation throughput under the synthetic workloads evaluated.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507561","On-chip interconnection networks;Router micro-architecture","Clocks;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Delay;Distributed computing;High performance computing;Internet;Microarchitecture;Network-on-a-chip;Throughput","buffer storage;logic design;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC router;distributed shared-buffer;input-buffered router;network-on-chip;output-buffered router;router microarchitecture","","10","","22","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NoCs face the communication scalability challenge while meeting tight power, area and latency constraints. Designers must address new challenges that were not present before. Defective components, the enhancement of application-level parallelism or power-aware techniques may break topology regularity, thus, efficient routing becomes a challenge.In this paper, uLBDR (Universal Logic-Based Distributed Routing) is proposed as an efficient logic-based mechanism that adapts to any irregular topology derived from 2D meshes, being an alternative to the use of routing tables (either at routers or at end-nodes). uLBDR requires a small set of configuration bits, thus being more practical than large routing tables implemented in memories. Several implementations of uLBDR are presented highlighting the trade-off between routing cost and coverage. The alternatives span from the previously proposed LBDR approach (with 30% of coverage) to the uLBDR mechanism achieving full coverage. This comes with a small performance cost, thus exhibiting the trade-off between fault tolerance and performance.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507564","Fault-tolerance;Networks-on-chip;Routing","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Costs;Delay;Fault tolerance;Manufacturing;Network-on-a-chip;Parallel processing;Routing;Scalability","network routing;network topology;network-on-chip","NoC;addressing manufacturing challenges;application level parallelism;cost efficient fault tolerant routing;logic based mechanism;networks-on-chip;power aware techniques;universal logic based distributed routing","","30","","24","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deadlocks can be caused by routing cycles in the network, or by message dependencies, even if the network itself is actually free of routing cycles. Two basic approaches to counter message dependent deadlocks exist: deadlock avoidance, which is most popular in NoCs, and deadlock recovery, which has until now only been used in parallel computer networks. Deadlock recovery promises low buffer space requirements and does not impose restrictions on connections between individual communication partners. For this study, we have adapted a deadlock recovery scheme for the use in NoCs and compared it to strict ordering as a representative of deadlock avoidance in terms of throughput and buffer space. The results show significant buffer space savings for deadlock recovery, however, at the cost of reduced data throughput.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507567","Network-on-chip;deadlock avoidance;deadlock recovery;message dependent deadlocks;strict ordering","Network-on-a-chip;System recovery","buffer storage;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;network-on-chip;system recovery","avoidance mechanism;buffer space;deadlock avoidance;deadlock recovery;message dependent deadlocks;network routing cycle;network-on-chip;on-chip interconnects;on-chip network;system-on-chip","","2","","13","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a simple yet efficient approach to VC implementation, which results in more area- and power-saving solutions than conventional design techniques. While these latter replicate only buffering resources for each physical link, we replicate the entire switch and prove that our solution is counter intuitively more area/power efficient while potentially operating at higher speeds.

To reduce the energy overhead, a configurable error control coding adapts the number of redundant wires to the varying noise conditions, achieving different error detection capability. Infrequently used redundant wires are used as spare wires to replace broken links. Furthermore, a packet rebuilding/restoring algorithm that cooperates with a shortened error control coding method is proposed to support a low-latency splitting transmission. With this co-management method, we manage transient errors and a small number of permanent errors, without using extra spare wires, to reduce the need for adaptive routing. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves up to 71% packet latency reduction and 20% throughput improvement, compared to previous methods.

In this paper, we show how dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) -based optical interconnects could be used to emulate multiple buses in a fully-buffered DIMM (FB-DIMM) -like memory system to improve both bandwidth and latency. We evaluate an optically connected memory using full-system simulations of an 8-core system running memory-intensive multithreaded workloads. We show that for the FFT benchmark, optically connected memory can reduce the average memory request latency by 29% compared to a single-channel DDR3 SDRAM system and provide an overall performance speedup of 1.20. We also show that at least two DDR3 memory channels are needed to match the performance of a single optical bus, which demonstrates the advantage of optical interconnects in terms of savings in the number of pins required.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507545","DRAM;DWDM;OC-DIMM;Optics;Performance Evaluation","Bandwidth;Delay;Multicore processing;Network-on-a-chip;Optical interconnections;Pins;SDRAM;Scalability;System performance;Wavelength division multiplexing","multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;performance evaluation","DWDM;dense wavelength division multiplexing;memory intensive multithreaded workloads;multicore system;off-chip network bandwidth;on-chip networks;optically connected memory modules;performance evaluation","","2","","23","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many researchers have provided various fault handling techniques in chip multi-processors (CMPs), the fault-tolerance of the interconnection network is yet to adequately evolve. As an end-to-end recovery approach delays fault detection and complicates recovery to a consistent global state in such a system, a link-level retransmission is endorsed for recovery, making a higher-level protocol simple. In this paper, we introduce a fault-tolerant flow control scheme for soft error handling in on-chip networks. The fault-tolerant flow control recovers errors at a link-level by requesting retransmission and ensures an error-free transmission on a flit-basis with incorporation of dynamic packet fragmentation. Dynamic packet fragmentation is adopted as a part of fault-tolerant flow control to disengage flits from the fault-containment and recover the faulty flit transmission. Thus, the proposed router provides a high level of dependability at the link-level for both datapath and control planes. In simulation with injected faults, the proposed router is observed to perform well, gracefully degrading while exhibiting 97% error coverage in datapath elements. The proposed router has been implemented using a TSMC 45 nm standard cell library. As compared to a router which employs triple modular redundancy (TMR) in datapath elements, the proposed router takes 58% less area and consumes 40% less energy per packet on average.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507558","fault-tolerant router;networks-on-chip;soft-error handling","Degradation;Delay;Error correction;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Libraries;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network-on-a-chip;Protocols;Redundancy","fault tolerant computing;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip","TSMC standard cell library;chip multiprocessors;dynamic packet fragmentation;fault handling techniques;fault-containment;fault-tolerant flow control;faulty flit transmission;interconnection network;link-level retransmission;on-chip networks;router;size 45 nm;triple modular redundancy","","11","","20","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The on-chip network that connects these cores needs to scale efficiently. The topology of on-chip networks is an important design choice that affects how these networks scale. Most current on-chip networks use 2-D mesh topologies which do not scale due to their large diameter and energy inefficiency. To tackle the scalability problem of 2-D meshes, various physical express topologies and virtual express topologies have been proposed. In addition, recently proposed link designs like capacitively driven low-swing interconnects can help lower link power and latency, and can favor these bypass designs. In this work, we compare these two kinds of express topologies under realistic system constraints using synthetic network traffic. We observe that both express topologies help reduce low-load latencies.

Bufferless flow control addresses this issue by removing router buffers, and handles contention by dropping or deflecting flits. This work compares virtual-channel (buffered) and deflection (packet-switched bufferless) flow control. Our evaluation includes optimizations for both schemes: buffered networks use custom SRAM-based buffers and empty buffer bypassing for energy efficiency, while bufferless networks feature a novel routing scheme that reduces average latency by 5%. Results show that unless process constraints lead to excessively costly buffers, the performance, cost and increased complexity of deflection flow control outweigh its potential gains: bufferless designs are only marginally (up to 1.5%) more energy efficient at very light loads, and buffered networks provide lower latency and higher throughput per unit power under most conditions.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507566","Buffers;Flow control;Multiprocessor interconnection;Networks","Costs;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Lighting control;Network-on-a-chip;Proposals;Routing;Throughput;Virtual colonoscopy","SRAM chips;buffer storage;network-on-chip","SRAM-based buffers;average latency reduction;onchip networks;packet-switched bufferless flow control;router buffers;routing scheme;virtual-channel","","28","","24","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routers of NoC have comparable thermal impact as processors and contributes significant to overall chip temperature. High temperature increases the vulnerability of the system in performance, power, reliability, and cost. To ensure both thermal safety and less performance impact from temperature regulation, we propose a traffic- and thermal-aware run-time thermal management (RTM) scheme.

As with all current VLSI design, however, reducing power consumption in NoCs is a critical challenge. One approach to reduce power is to dynamically scale the voltage and frequency of each network node or groups of nodes (DVFS). Another approach to reduce power consumption is to replace the balanced clock tree with a globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS) clocking scheme. NoCs implemented with either of these schemes, however, tend to have high latencies as packets must be synchronized at intermediate nodes between source and destination. In this paper, we propose a novel router microarchitecture which offers superior performance versus typical synchronizing router designs. Our approach features Asynchronous Bypass Channels (ABCs) at intermediate nodes thus avoiding synchronization delay. We also propose several new network topology and routing algorithm that leverage the advantages of the bypass channel offered by our router design. Our experiments show that our design improves the performance of a conventional synchronizing design with similar resources by up to 26% at low loads and increases saturation throughput by up to 50%.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507563","GALS;NoC;asynchronous interconnect;on-chip networks","Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Frequency synchronization;Microarchitecture;Network topology;Network-on-a-chip;Routing;Very large scale integration;Voltage","VLSI;integrated circuit design;network routing;network-on-chip;synchronisation","VLSI design;asynchronous bypass channels;global-asynchronous clocking scheme;local-synchronous clocking scheme;multisynchronous NoC;network node;networks-on-chip;on-chip communications;power consumption;router design synchronization;router microarchitecture;saturation throughput;shared-bus designs;synchronization delay","","4","","20","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We develop our interconnect at three levels: at the first level (x) we design a fully connected network for exploiting locality; at the second level(y), we design a shared channel using optical tokens to reduce power while providing full connectivity and at the third level (z), we propose a novel nanophotonic crossbar that provides scalable bisection bandwidth. The first two levels are combined into T-PROPEL(token-PROPEL, 64 cores) and four separate T-PROPELs are combined into ET-PROPEL (256 cores). We have simulated both T-PROPEL and ET-PROPEL using synthetic and SPLASH-2 traffic, where our results indicate that T-PROPEL and ET-PROPEL significantly reduce power(10-fold) and increase performance (3-fold) over other well known electrical and photonic networks.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507544","Interconnects;Low-Power architecture;Network-on-Chip;Optoelectronic","CMOS technology;Delay;LAN interconnection;Multicore processing;Network-on-a-chip;Optical design;Photonics;Power dissipation;Scalability;Wire","microprocessor chips;multiprocessor interconnection networks;nanophotonics;network-on-chip;optical interconnections;parallel architectures","CMOS;ET-PROPEL architecture;SPLASH-2 traffic;chip multiprocessor;complementary metal oxide semiconductor;extended token based photonic reconfigurable on-chip power and area-efficient links architecture;high-bandwidth multilevel hybrid interconnect;high-performance multi-level hybrid nanophotonic interconnect;low latency multilevel hybrid interconnect;low power multilevel hybrid interconnect;multicores;nanophotonic crossbar;nanophotonic technology;network-on-chip;optical token;power dissipation;power-efficient multi-level hybrid nanophotonic interconnect;scalable bisection bandwidth;shared buses;shared channel;synthetic traffic","","8","","29","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our own tool, ANetGen, specifies the asynchronous network by determining the topology with simulated-annealing and router locations with force-directed placement. It uses energy and delay models from our 65 nm bundled-data router design. SystemC simulations varied traffic burstiness using the self-similar b-model.

For many high-performance computing applications, the bandwidth available for both on- and off-chip communications can play a vital role in efficient execution due to the use of data-parallel or data-centric algorithms. Electronic interconnected systems are increasingly bound by their communications infrastructure and the associated power dissipation of high-bandwidth data movement. Recent advances in chip-scale silicon photonic technologies have created the potential for developing optical interconnection networks that can offer highly energy efficient communications and significantly improve computing performance-per-Watt. This talk will examine the design and performance of photonic networks-on-chip architectures that support both on-chip communication and off-chip memory access in an energy efficient manner.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507568","","Bandwidth;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Energy efficiency;Feeds;Interconnected systems;Memory architecture;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Optical computing","integrated optics;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip;optical interconnections;parallel processing;power aware computing","chip multiprocessors;chip scale silicon photonic technology;computing performance-per-Watt;data centric algorithm;data parallel algorithm;electronic interconnected system;energy efficient communications;high performance computing;off-chip bandwidth;off-chip memory access;on-chip communication;on-chip computational power;optical interconnection networks;performance energy optimized computing;photonic chip scale interconnection network;photonic networks-on-chip architectures","","0","","","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, complex embedded applications become data-dependent and their execution time depends on their input data. For this reason, on-line task and data allocation is needed to optimize the architecture efficiency. Moreover, communications are a complex problem in many-core architectures. Because of dynamic allocation, communication paths and network loads become unpredictable, which must be handled by the network. This paper proposes an evaluation of different network topologies in terms of performance and area for many-core architectures. It concludes that hierarchical networks are the best trade-off. In particular, the MultiCross topology is 10 times more efficient than the mesh topology.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507546","area efficiency;hierarchical network on chip","Computer architecture;Delay effects;Engines;ISO;Network-on-a-chip;Open systems;Performance analysis;Queueing analysis;System recovery;Tiles","embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;network topology;network-on-chip","data allocation;embedded many-core architectures;hierarchical network-on-chip;network topologies;online task","","5","","15","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While static reconfiguration between applications has already been extensively studied, we propose a potential increase in hardware resource usage by enabling concurrent or overlapping applications on the top of a heterogeneous NoC platform. In this paper, we describe a distributed sequencing protocol allowing hardware resource sharing between several applications. This protocol ensures correct synchronization of the processing between hardware resources without the need of a global fine-grain scheduler on the system, thus alleviating the pressure on the run-time system. The proposed protocol has been integrated and validated in a NoC-based digital baseband for 4G SDR telecom applications, and was integrated on a manufactured chip on a STMicroelectronics CMOS 65 nm LP technology.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507543","Distributed Systems;Networks-on-Chip","Baseband;CMOS technology;Embedded system;Hardware;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing;Network-on-a-chip;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunications","embedded systems;network-on-chip;parallel architectures","NoC architectures;distributed sequencing;embedded systems;fine grain scheduler;multiapplicative heterogeneous NoC platforms;resource sharing;static reconfiguration","","0","","14","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improving the Performance of GALS-Based NoCs in the Presence of Process Variation","Herna&#x0301;ndez, C.; Roca, A.; Silla, F.; Flich, J.; Duato, J.","Univ. Politec. de Valencia, Valencia, Spain","Networks-on-Chip (NOCS), 2010 Fourth ACM/IEEE International Symposium on","20100712","2010","","","35","42","Current integration scales allow designing chip multiprocessors (CMP) where cores are interconnected by means of a network-on-chip (NoC). Unfortunately, the small feature size of current integration scales cause some unpredictability in manufactured devices because of process variation. In NoCs,variability may affect links and routers causing that they do not match the parameters established at design time. In this paper we first analyze the way that manufacturing deviations affect the components of a NoC by applying a comprehensive and detailed variability model to 200 instances of an 8×8 mesh NoC synthesized using 45 nm technology. A second contribution of this paper is showing that GALS-based NoCs present communication bottlenecks under process variation. To overcome this performance reduction we draft a novel approach, called performance domains, intended to reduce the negative impact of variability on application execution time. This mechanism is suitable when several applications are simultaneously running in the CMP chip.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507565","","Energy consumption;Frequency;Manufacturing processes;Network-on-a-chip;Planarization;Pulp manufacturing;Scalability;Semiconductor device modeling;Switches;Virtual manufacturing","integrated circuit design;large scale integration;network-on-chip;performance evaluation","GALS-based NoCs;chip multiprocessors;integration scales;manufacturing deviations;network-on-chip;performance domains;process variation","","4","","28","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Low-Overhead Asynchronous Interconnection Network for GALS Chip Multiprocessors","Horak, M.N.; Nowick, S.M.; Carlberg, M.; Vishkin, U.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","Networks-on-Chip (NOCS), 2010 Fourth ACM/IEEE International Symposium on","20100712","2010","","","43","50","A new asynchronous interconnection network is introduced for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS)chip multiprocessors. The network eliminates the need for global clock distribution, and can interface multiple synchronous timing domains operating at unrelated clock rates. In particular, two new highly-concurrent asynchronous components are introduced which provide simple routing and arbitration/merge functions. Post-layout simulations in identical commercial 90 nm technology indicate that comparable recent synchronous router nodes have 5.6-10.7x more energy per packet and 2.8-6.4x greater area than the new asynchronous nodes. Under random traffic, the network provides significantly lower latency and competitive throughput over the entire operating range of the 800 MHz network and through mid-range traffic rates for the 1.36 GHz network, but with degradation at higher traffic rates. Preliminary evaluations are also presented for a mixed-timing (GALS) network in a shared-memory parallel architecture, running both random traffic and parallel benchmark kernels, as well as directions for further improvement.","","978-1-4244-7085-3","978-1-4244-7086-0","10.1109/NOCS.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507562","","Clocks;Degradation;Delay;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Parallel architectures;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Timing;Traffic control","network-on-chip;shared memory systems","GALS chip multiprocessors;arbitration functions;global clock distribution;low overhead asynchronous interconnection network;merge functions;shared memory parallel architecture;unrelated clock rates","","13","","32","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
