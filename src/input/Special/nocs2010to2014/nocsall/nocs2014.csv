In this paper we propose Hermes, a highly-robust, distributed fault-tolerant routing algorithm, whose performance degrades gracefully with increasing faulty NoC link counts. Hermes is a deadlock-free hybrid routing algorithm, utilizing load-balanced routing on fault-free paths, while providing pre-reconfigured escape routes in the vicinity of faults. An initial experimental evaluation shows that Hermes improves network throughput by up to 2.2× when compared against the existing state-of-the-art.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008782","","Broadcasting;Network topology;Ports (Computers);Routing;System recovery;Throughput;Topology","fault tolerant computing;network routing;network-on-chip","Hermes;deadlock-free hybrid routing algorithm;distributed fault-tolerant routing algorithm;fault-free paths;faulty NoC link counts;load-balanced routing;multicore chip;networks-on-chips;prereconfigured escape routes","","0","","8","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the current issues in NoC routing is the use of acyclic Channel Dependency Graph (CDG) for deadlock freedom. This requirement forces certain routing turns to be prohibited, thus, reducing the degree of adaptiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel non-minimal turn model which allows cycles in CDG provided that Extended Channel Dependency Graph (ECDG) remains acyclic. The proposed turn model reduces number of restrictions on routing turns, hence able to provide path diversity through additional minimal and non-minimal routes between source and destination.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008785","Networks-on-Chip;deadlock freedom;degree of adaptiveness;non-minimal paths;routing","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Glass;Nickel;Routing;Solid modeling;System recovery","integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;network routing;network-on-chip","2D NoCs;ECDG;acyclic channel dependency graph;bus-based interconnects;deadlock freedom;extended channel dependency graph;highly adaptive routing;microarchitectures;networks-on-chips;nonminimal turn model","","0","","5","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Input buffers utilized in routers consume a significant part of the total power of NoCs. In order to reduce this power consumption, a novel power efficient memory called Marching Memory Through type (MMTH) is introduced. By connecting transparent latches in tandem, MMTH achieves high speed operation with a low power consumption. MMTH, however, requires a certain overhead at read operation, and hence we propose a latency reduction scheme based on the look-ahead routing. The proposed router was designed in Renesas's 40nm process and compared with a standard router using conventional register-based FIFOs in terms of the network performance, application performance, and power consumption. The result of evaluation shows that the proposed router reduces the power consumption by 42.4% on average at 2GHz and the expense of only 0.5-2.0% performance overhead.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008769","","Clocks;Delays;Latches;Ports (Computers);Power demand;Random access memory;Routing","buffer circuits;flip-flops;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip","MMTH;Renesas process;frequency 2 GHz;input buffers;latency reduction scheme;look-ahead routing;low power NoC router;many core processors;marching memory through type;network-on-chip;power consumption;register-based FIFOs;size 40 nm;transparent latches","","0","","29","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This usually involves a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to reveal the effects of all potential failures. Moreover, the Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a shared component and plays central role in a mixed-critical system, which must guarantee the isolation between tasks, that may have distinct criticality levels. We present an FMEA-based system-level analysis for NoCs designed for mixed-critical systems. It comprises FMEA, error effects classification regarding duration and isolation violation, and technology independent probability assessment. The analysis gives effective insight into fault-related weaknesses of the NoC, and enables considerable improvements to the NoC's resilience with minimal overhead. We apply it to a typical packet-switched NoC and present the results.

As the number of cores per chip increases, the network interconnecting them must satisfy the growing communication needs. However, several factors as aggressive traffic patterns, power-saving and fault-tolerance mechanisms may lead to oversubscribed resources in the network, thereby generating congestion and so degrading the overall network performance. In this paper we propose ICARO, a mechanism to dynamically isolate the traffic flows contributing to congestion making use of dedicated virtual networks. In this way, ICARO prevents the head-of-line blocking effect derived from congestion, thereby improving overall network performance. We analyze thoroughly our proposal, especially from the robustness point of view, showing that it effectively manages to identify and isolate congested flows, improving network performance up to 82% with respect to previous proposals.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008775","","Measurement;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Proposals;Registers;Routing;Switches","fault tolerance;isolation technology;network-on-chip","aggressive traffic flow patterns;computing power;congestion isolation;dedicated virtual networks;fault-tolerance mechanisms;head-of-line blocking effect;network interconnection;networks-on-chip;overall network performance improvement;oversubscribed resources;power-saving;single chip","","0","","23","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first derive the speedup metric of an NoC architecture which directly maps the HPGA onto NoC in order to identify the main sources of performance bottlenecks. Specifically, it is observed that the speedup is mostly affected by the fixed bandwidth that a master processor can use and the low utilization of slave processor cores. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a new architecture with two multiplexing schemes, namely dynamic injection bandwidth multiplexing (DIBM) and time-division based island multiplexing (TDIM), to improve the speedup and reduce the hardware requirements. Moreover, a task-aware adaptive routing algorithm is designed for the proposed architecture, which can take advantage of the proposed multiplexing schemes to further reduce the hardware overhead. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using the problem of protein folding prediction, which is a process of importance in biology. Our experimental results show that the proposed NoC architecture achieves up to 240X speedup compared to a single island design. The hardware cost is also reduced by 50% compared to a direct NoC-based HPGA implementation.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008757","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Genetic algorithms;Hardware;Multiplexing;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip;time division multiplexing","DIBM;NoC architecture;NoC-based HPGA implementation;TDIM;dynamic injection bandwidth multiplexing;hierarchical parallel genetic algorithm;multicore SoC platform;multicore system-on-chip platform;network-on-chip architecture;performance bottlenecks;protein folding prediction;slave processor cores;speedup metric;task-aware adaptive routing algorithm;time-division based island multiplexing","","0","","14","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the Headfirst sliding routing scheme to overcome the simple static TDMA-based vertical buses. Each vertical bus grants a communication time-slot for different chips at the same time periodically, which means these buses work with different phases. Depending on the current time, packets are routed toward the best vertical bus (elevator) just before the elevator acquires its communication time-slot. Network simulations show that Headfirst sliding routing reduces the communication latency by up to 32.7%, and full-system CMP simulations show that it reduces application execution time by 9.9%.

However, a large portion of the parallel workload space, both in emerging and traditional domains, remains ill-suited for GPGPU deployment due to high reliance on atomic operations, particularly as global synchronization mechanisms. Unlike the sophisticated synchronization primitives available on supercomputers, GPGPU applications must rely on slow atomic operations on shared data. Further, unlike general purpose processors which take advantage of coherent L1 caches to speed up atomic operations, the cost and complexity of coherency on the GPU, coupled with the fact that a GPU's primary revenue stream - graphics rendering - does not benefit, means that new approaches are needed to improve atomics on the GPU. In this paper, we present a mechanism for implementing low-cost coherence and speculative acquisition of atomic data on the GPU that allows applications that utilize atomics to greater extents than is generally accepted practice today, to perform much better than they do on current hardware. As our results show, these unconventional applications can realize non-trivial performance improvements approaching 20% with our proposed system. With this mechanism, the scope of applications that can be accelerated by these commodity, highly-parallel pieces of hardware can be greatly expanded.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558404","","Coherence;Complexity theory;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Synchronization;Wires","cache storage;graphics processing units;mainframes;rendering (computer graphics)","GPGPU;L1 caches;atomic operations;general purpose computing;graphics rendering;supercomputers","","0","","18","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a methodology where network packets are repurposed for the storage of debug information collected during execution. Debug data pertaining to each packet is collected at routers along its path and stored by replacing the packet's original data content. Our solution is coupled with a detection scheme consisting of small checkers that monitor execution and flag bugs. Upon bug detection, we analyze the debug information to reconstruct network traffic.We also provide relevant statistics for debugging, such as packet interactions and packet latencies, per router.

In particular, how to distribute the traffic among the hierarchy levels to effectively utilize the hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a dynamic traffic distribution scheme that adapts traffic distribution among the hierarchy levels to the changing traffic conditions.

While NoCs provide high and scalable bandwidth, current routing algorithms, such as dimension-ordered routing, suffer from poor load balance, leading to reduced throughput and high latencies. Improving load balance, hence, is critical in future CMP designs where increased latency leads to wasted power and energy waiting for outstanding requests to resolve. Adaptive routing is a known technique to improve load balance, however, prior adaptive routing techniques either use local or regionally aggregated information to form their routing decisions. This paper proposes a new, light-weight, adaptive routing algorithm for on-chip routers based on global link state and congestion information, Global Congestion Awareness (GCA). GCA uses a simple, low-complexity route calculation unit, to calculate paths to their destination without the myopia of local decisions, nor the aggregation of unrelated status information, found in prior designs. In particular GCA outperforms local adaptive routing by 26%, Regional Congestion Awareness (RCA) by 15%, and a recent competing adaptive routing algorithm, DAR, by 8% on average on realistic workloads.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558405","","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Measurement;Ports (Computers);Routing;Vectors","network routing;network-on-chip","CMP design;GCA;NoC;RCA;adaptive routing;congestion information;dimension-ordered routing;global congestion awareness;global link state;light-weight algorithm;load balance;network-on-chip;on-chip router;regional congestion awareness","","3","","17","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At low loads, the CB is power gated, bypassed, and optimized to produce single cycle operation. A novel extension to bubble flow control enables routing deadlock and message dependent deadlock to be avoided with the same mechanism having constant buffer size per router independent of the number of message types. This solution enables end-to-end latency reduction via high radix switches with low overall buffer requirements.

This paper presents simulation results and comparisons between dynamic (requiring reset) and non-dynamic synchronizer flip-flops implemented in predictive models for both planar technologies and future FinFET technologies. Results demonstrate that synchronizers built with FinFET devices 1) exhibit a tau value which continues to scale with fan-out of four delay and 2) can be improved with forward biasing, but 3) are more sensitive to temperature. Dynamic flip-flops settled metastability fastest when using standard technology voltages, but previously couldn't be used in non-dynamic systems.

The proposed architecture utilizes an efficient buffering strategy and allows for modular pipelined organizations that increase the clock frequency. Moreover, it offers maximum freedom in terms of physical placement, by allowing the NoC components to be physically spread throughout the chip, irrespective of the network topology. The combined effect of all supported features enables significant delay reductions under equal performance, when compared to state-of-the-art VC-based NoC implementations.

Therefore, on-chip laser sources are being evaluated as candidates to drive the on-chip photonic links. In this paper, we first explore the power, efficiency and temperature tradeoffs associated with an on-chip laser source. Using a 3D stacked system that integrates a manycore chip with the optical devices and laser sources, we explore the design space for laser source sharing (among waveguides) and placement to minimize laser power by simultaneously considering the network bandwidth requirements, thermal constraints, and physical layout constraints. As part of this exploration we consider Clos and crossbar logical topologies, U-shaped and W-shaped physical layouts, and various sharing/placement strategies: locally-placed dedicated laser sources for waveguides, locally-placed shared laser sources, and shared laser sources placed remotely along the chip edges. Our analysis shows that logical topology, physical layout, and photonic device losses strongly drive the laser source sharing and placement choices to minimize laser power.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008766","","Laser modes;Laser theory;Optical waveguides;Photonics;Power lasers;System-on-chip;Waveguide lasers","integrated circuit layout;lasers;network-on-chip;optical interconnections;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D stacked system;electrical links;global on-chip communications;on-chip laser sources placement;on-chip laser sources sharing;on-chip photonic device;optical devices;optical waveguides;physical layout constraints;silicon photonic NoC","","1","","40","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, ABNs readily tolerate silicon defects with just the extra cost of detection. For application benchmarks, ABNs reduce total power consumption by up to 45% with comparable performance compared to single-lane power-gated networks, and up to 33% compared to multi-network designs.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008767","","Bandwidth;Benchmark testing;Clocks;Delays;Logic gates;Ports (Computers);Resource management","SRAM chips;elemental semiconductors;low-power electronics;network-on-chip;silicon","Si;adaptive bandwidth networks;application traffic;average traffic;drowsy SRAM cells;false VC activation elimination;large-scale chips;on-chip network;power budgets;power consumption;risk degrading performance;silicon defects;static power overheads;static power reduction;variable-width datapath;virtual channels;worst-case traffic loads","","0","","39","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Extending bufferless on-chip networks to high-throughput workloads","Hanjoon Kim; Changhyun Kim; Kim, M.; Kanghee Won; Kim, J.","Dept. of Comput.

However, bufferless NoC has some limitations that include lower network throughput caused by deflection routing at high load. In addition, the longer router critical path impacts the router frequency, which reduces the amount of bandwidth provided by the network router. These limitations reduce any benefit of bufferless NoC - especially for high-throughput workloads such as GPGPU. In this work, we first provide a simple analysis into how the benefit of bufferless NoC can be reduced for high throughput workloads, especially in terms of energy-efficiency. We then propose clumsy flow control (CFC) - a congestion control mechanism that can reduce the amount of deflection and improve the efficiency of bufferless NoC. The clumsy flow control enables the allocation to be simplified and we propose a novel switch allocation (randomized-deterministic allocation) which significantly reduces the router critical path. The combination of these two techniques result in our bufferless NoC to exceed the system performance of buffered network by approximately 7% (up to 22%) while reducing network area by 53% and energy by 52%.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008756","","Artificial neural networks;Bandwidth;Erbium;Resource management;Routing;System recovery;Throughput","flow control;network routing;network-on-chip","CFC;bufferless NoC;bufferless on-chip networks;clumsy flow control;congestion control mechanism;deflection routing;energy-efficiency;high-throughput workloads;randomized-deterministic allocation;router critical path;switch allocation","","0","","22","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network-on-chip is a common solution for the interconnection of large processor arrays. Existing analytic models for the performance analysis of network-on-chip often possess a lack of accuracy, if applied for the popular round-robin arbitration scheme. It turns out to be challenging to find an appropriate analytic representation for this apparently simple scheme. In this paper, we propose an accurate service time estimation model that is designed for round-robin arbiters. It is further employed to a queueing model for network-on-chip. The comparison with cycle-accurate simulation proves the accuracy of the proposed service time model, which is essential for predicting key performance indicators, such as network throughput or latencies.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558403","analytic model;network-on-chip;noc;queueing theory;round-robin","Accuracy;Analytical models;Equations;Estimation;Network topology;Routing;Switches","circuit simulation;estimation theory;integrated circuit interconnections;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;queueing theory","cycle-accurate simulation;embedded application;many-core system-on-chip;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network latency;network throughput;network-on-chip;performance analysis;performance requirement;processor array interconnection;queueing model;round-robin arbitration scheme;service time estimation model;service time model;simulation model","","0","","20","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, in such scenarios, it is likely that a system seldom reaches stationarity, and steady-state models are inapplicable. In this work, we propose queuing-theoretic models for the transient analysis of output contention in Network-on-Chip. Contention occurs when multiple input queues intend to forward to the same output, and it is one of the main reasons for increased latencies and blocking probabilities in input-buffered routers. In Network-on-Chip, the end-to-end latency of a single packet can be determined by adding the latencies along its path. Therefore, understanding interactions within a single router are beneficial for system and parameter design of Network-on-Chip. Furthermore, we validate the models proposed by numerical evaluations which confirm the accuracy and practicality of the queuing models.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008762","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Network-on-chip;Numerical models;Queueing analysis;Steady-state;Transient analysis","network-on-chip;probability;queueing theory;transient analysis","blocking probabilities;end-to-end latency;input-buffered routers;network-on-chip;queuing-theoretic models;steady-state conditions;steady-state models;traffic patterns;transient analysis;transient queuing models","","0","","17","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regardless of all varieties, there has always been a common assumption between them. Most of all known fault-tolerant methods are based on rerouting packets around faults. Rerouting might take place through nonminimal paths which affect the performance significantly not only by taking longer paths but also by creating hotspot around a fault. In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant approach based on using the shortest paths. This method maintains the performance of Networks-on-Chip in the presence of faults. To avoid using non-minimal paths, the router architecture is slightly modified. In the new form of architecture, there is an ability to connect the horizontal and orthogonal links of a faulty router such that healthy routers are kept connected to each other. Based on this architecture, a fault-tolerant routing algorithm is presented which is obviously much simpler than traditional fault-tolerant routing algorithms. According to this algorithm, only the shortest paths are used by packets in the presence of fault. This results retains the performance of NoCs in faulty situations. This algorithm is highly reliable, for an instance, the reliability is more than 99.5% when there are six faulty routers in an 8×8 mesh network.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558401","","Face;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Routing;Switches;Wires","fault tolerance;network routing;network-on-chip","connection retaining structure;fault tolerant routing algorithm;faulty routers;healthy routers;horizontal links;mesh network;minimal path fault tolerant method;network on chip;off chip network;on chip network;orthogonal links;rerouting packet;router architecture","","3","","22","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Design and optimization of multi- and many-core systems on chip (SoCs) that exploit small-world effects have already been demonstrated [1]. Small-world graphs are characterized by many short-distance links between neighboring nodes as well as a few relatively long-distance direct shortcuts.

We take a radical approach when designing the network and memory, by effectively co-designing both. We take into account the visibility of the whole chip resources to the memory controller, which is in charge of providing the appropriate support for virtualization and memory-level fault-tolerance. Then, the network is designed taking into account the memory coherence protocol and providing solutions for the critical communication requirements of memory modules (caches) and processors in a virtualized domain. The coherence protocol is also designed in order to allow its effective use in a virtualized scenario. With our approach, the chip can be fully virtualized on application demand providing total partitioning of core resources and smart use of memory resources. Results demonstrate that our scheme effectively optimizes the utilization of chip resources, allowing the implementation of techniques which can outperform a first-touch policy up to a 6%, reducing LLC misses and enabling LLC fault tolerance.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558410","","Coherence;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Ports (Computers);Routing;Switches;Tiles","cache storage;fault tolerance;network-on-chip","LLC;NoC;cache hierarchy substrate;chip resources virtualization;last-level cache;many-core chip system;memory coherence protocol;memory module;memory-level fault-tolerance;on-chip interconnect","","0","","16","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem with such schemes is their high buffer space requirement which consumes significant power and area. In this work, we propose bubble sharing flow control to provide deadlock freedom with small, shared central buffers, eliminating edge buffers, improving buffer utilization, and decreasing router buffer requirements. The key insight involves sharing of the flit-size bubbles (free buffers) among cyclic network paths via central buffers in the router, reducing the overall router buffering space requirement. This technique effectively reconciles the trade-off between high radix and buffer space, encouraging the use of low hop count, high-radix topologies, with both deterministic and adaptive routing. Comparisons show improvement in average packet latency by 31% as compared to traditional 2VC edge buffer routers with 33% reduction in area for an 8×8 generalized hypercube topology.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008770","","Adaptive systems;Aerospace electronics;Grippers;Ports (Computers);Routing;Routing protocols;System recovery","buffer circuits;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;network routing;network-on-chip","area efficient adaptive router;bubble sharing;central buffers;centralized buffers;cyclic network paths;edge buffers;energy efficient adaptive router;multiple virtual channels;radix-buffer space trade-offs;router buffering space requirement","","0","","17","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a single physical link energy per bit is not a sufficient metric to benchmark these strategies, as the choice leads to strong implications on various parts of the system, including clock distribution, data synchronization between blocks, arbitration for shared resources in the network or at network boundaries, tuning of the optical devices on laser wavelengths, and thermal management at different granularity levels, from photonic devices to chip. Based on a system-level integration analysis, we identify trends on the best candidate depending on bandwidth requirements and number of stacked dies.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008777","Interposers;Networks-on-Chip;Silicon Photonics","CMOS integrated circuits;High-speed optical techniques;Optical buffering;Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Synchronization","CMOS integrated circuits;elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit interconnections;network-on-chip;silicon;system-on-chip","CMOS interposers;DC lines;NoC;RF microstrip lines;Si;SoC;clock distribution;data synchronization;interconnect topology;multipoint links;optical devices;optical interposers;photonic devices;silicon interposer 2.5D stacking;silicon interposers;thermal management","","0","","5","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is the MPSoCs communication architecture which determines the collaboration efficiency. The migration towards MPSoCs is propelled by the shrinking feature sizes in each generation of process technology. On the one hand, smaller transistors allow for more processor cores and memories on a single chip and result in more on-chip computations as well as communications. On the other hand, reducing feature sizes makes on-chip communication more difficult. The International Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) shows that the latency of metallic interconnects increases exponentially as feature sizes decrease. On-chip communication using metallic interconnects will need more than one clock cycle to send information from sources to destinations. Moreover, metallic interconnects consume a significant amount of power. Studies shows that global metallic interconnects could consume kilowatts of power to achieve required communication bandwidth by 2020 [1].","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008776","","","","","","0","","","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, advanced switching mechanisms like virtual cut-through (VCT) are appealing due to their inherited benefits (less network contention, higher throughput, and simpler broadcast implementations). Moreover, adaptive routing algorithms exploit the inherited bandwidth of the network providing higher throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel flow control mechanism, referred to as type-based flow control (TBFC), and a new adaptive routing algorithm for NoCs. First, the reduced flow control strategy allows using minimum buffer resources, while still allowing VCT. Then, on top of TBFC we implement the safe/unsafe routing algorithm (SUR). This algorithm allows higher performance than previous proposals as it achieves a proper balanced utilization of input port buffers. Results show the same performance of fully adaptive routing algorithms but using less resources. When resources are matched, SUR achieves up to 20% throughput improvement.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008758","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008758","","IP networks;Multiplexing;Ports (Computers);Routing;Switches;System recovery","buffer circuits;integrated circuit design;network-on-chip","NoC designs;buffer resource minimization;flow control;safe/unsafe routing algorithm","","0","","25","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A probe system includes a probe System Manager (SM) for turning on probe system, a probe Generator (GEN) for generating probes, a Link Selection (LS) connected to a Switch Allocation (SA), which is used for copying the generated probes, transmitting probes backward, and discarding probes when the probes find that the traversal path is just a congestion not a deadlock or when probe congestion occurs. There is also a TB Calculation (TBC) in LS for TB settings. Finally, a probe comparator (PB Comparator) is used for claiming deadlocks.

"Single-cycle collective communication over a shared network fabric","Krishna, T.; Li-Shiuan Peh","VSSAD, Intel Corp., Hudson, MA, USA","Networks-on-Chip (NoCS), 2014 Eighth IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20150115","2014","","","1","8","In the multicore era, on-chip network latency and throughput have a direct impact on system performance. A highly important class of communication flows traversing the network is collective, i.e., one-to-many and many-to-one. Scalable coherence protocols often leverage imprecise tracking to lower the overhead of directory storage, in turn leading to more collective communications on-chip. Routers with support for message forking/aggregation have been previously demonstrated, supporting such protocols. However, even with the fastest possible designs today (1-cycle routers), collective flows on a k×k mesh still incur delays proportional to k since all communication is across the entire chip. As k increases across technology generations, the latency of these flows will also go up. However, the pure wire delay to cross the chip is just 1-2 cycles today, and is expected to remain roughly invariant. The dependence of message delays on k arises due to the requirement to latch messages at every router. In this work, we remove this requirement.We design a network fabric that enables messages to (1) dynamically create virtual 1-to-Many (multicast) and Many-to-1 (reduction) tree routes over a physical mesh, (2) get forked/aggregated at nodes on the tree, and (3) traverse the tree - all within a single-cycle across each dimension. For synthetic 1-to-Many/Many-to-1 flows, we demonstrate 76/82% reduction in latency, and 1.6/2X improvement in throughput over a state-of-the-art NoC with 1-cycle routers and support for collective communication. Across a suite of SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks, full-system runtime and energy is reduced by 14% and 50% for a limited-directory protocol.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008755","","Delays;Routing protocols;Switches;Throughput;Unicast;Wires","microprocessor chips;multicast protocols;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC design;PARSEC benchmarks;SPLASH-2 benchmarks;communications on-chip;latch messages;on-chip network;scalable coherence protocols;shared network fabric;single-cycle collective communication","","0","","27","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike existing synchronous, mesochronous and asynchronous router designs with similar functionality, the router is able to silently skip over cycles/TDM-slots where no traffic is scheduled and hence avoid all switching activity in the idle links and router ports. In this way switching activity is reduced to the minimum possible amount. The fact that this relaxed synchronization is sufficient to implement TDM scheduling represents a contribution at the conceptual level. The idea can only be implemented using asynchronous circuit techniques. To this end, the paper explores the use of “click-element” templates. Click-element templates use only flip-flops and conventional gates, and this greatly simplifies the design process when using conventional EDA tools and standard cell libraries. Few papers, if any, have explored this.","","","","10.1109/NOCS.2014.7008774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008774","","Clocks;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Routing;Schedules;Synchronization;Time division multiplexing","asynchronous circuits;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;network routing;network-on-chip;synchronisation","EDA tools;TDM scheduling;TDM-scheduled NOC;asynchronous circuit techniques;asynchronous router design;click-element templates;cycles-TDM-slots;flip-flops;idle links;relaxed synchronization;router ports;standard cell libraries;switching activity;time-division-multiplexed networks-on-chip","","0","","21","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On self-tuning networks-on-chip for dynamic network-flow dominance adaptation","Xiaohang Wang; Mak, T.; Mei Yang; Yingtao Jiang; Daneshtalab, M.; Palesi, M.","","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2013 Seventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20130715","2013","","","1","8","Modern networks-on-chip (NoC) systems are required to handle complex run-time traffic patterns and unprecedented applications. Data traffics of these applications are difficult to be fully comprehended at design-time so as to optimize the network design. However, it has been discovered that the majority data flows in a network are dominated by less than 10% of the specific pathways. In this paper, we introduce a method that is capable of identifying critical pathways in a network at run-time and, then, can dynamically reconfigure the network to optimize for the network performance subjected to the identified dominated flows. An online learning and analysis scheme is employed to quickly discover the emerged dominated traffic flows and provides a statistical traffic prediction using regression analysis. The architecture of a self-tuning network is also discussed which can be reconfigured by setting up the identified point-to-point paths for the dominance data flows in large traffic volumes. The merits of this new approach are experimentally demonstrated using comprehensive NoC simulators. Compared to the conventional network architectures over a range of realistic applications, the proposed self-tuning network approach can effectively reduce the latency and power consumption by as much as 25% and 24%, respectively. We also evaluated the configuration time and additional hardware cost. This new approach demonstrates the capability of an adaptive NoC to handle more complex and dynamic applications.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558418","networks-on-chips;reconfigurable;regression;self-tuning","Benchmark testing;Control systems;Data models;Electronic mail;Pipelines;Polynomials;Predictive models","network-on-chip;performance evaluation;regression analysis","NoC systems;analysis scheme;capability;complex run-time traffic patterns;comprehensive NoC simulators;critical pathways;data traffics;design-time;dominance data flows;dominated traffic flows;dynamic network-flow dominance adaptation;hardware cost;identified dominated flows;majority data flows;network architectures;network design;network performance;online learning;point-to-point paths;power consumption;regression analysis;self-tuning network approach;self-tuning networks-on-chip;statistical traffic prediction;traffic volumes","","5","","20","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The synthesis of an application-specific NoC is a combinatorial problem. This paper presents a novel heuristic for solving the routing path allocation step. Its main advantages are the support of realistic nonlinear cost estimation and the ability to handle latency constraints, which guarantee high performance of processing elements sensitive to communication delays. Additionally, the method generates deadlock-free routing by avoiding cycles in the channel dependency graph. The NoC is constructed sequentially in a greedy manner by selecting the routing path for each communication flow in such a way that the additional NoC HW resources are kept minimal. The routing path is found using a binary search cheapest bounded path (BSCBP) algorithm. The method is highly efficient and provides a NoC routing path allocation for a smart phone SoC with 25 processing elements and 96 flows in less than a minute.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558417","","Delays;Hardware;Ports (Computers);Resource management;Routing;System recovery;System-on-chip","graph theory;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip;search problems","BSCBP algorithm;NoC HW resource;NoC routing path allocation;NoC structure;NoC topology;application-specific NoC synthesis;application-specific systems-on-a-chip;area metric;binary search cheapest bounded path;channel dependency graph;combinatorial problem;communication delay;communication flow;greedy approach;latency constraint;latency-bounded deadlock-free routing path allocation;network-on-chip;power metric;processing element;realistic nonlinear cost estimation;smart phone SoC","","1","","16","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the growth in VC count results in increased arbitration complexity and reduced router clock frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel high-frequency many-input arbiter design for many-VC routers. It is based on the speculation on short and thus fast arbitrations in case of high VC occupancy. We further enhance it to reduce arbitration latency and promote speculation opportunity. Simulation results show that using the proposed arbiter, a 16-VC router achieves almost the same performance as an ideal design, showing improvements of around 48% on zero-load latency and 100% on network throughput over a naive 16-VC design.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558415","","Clocks;Delays;Organizations;Ports (Computers);Routing;Throughput;Wires","network-on-chip","NoC;arbitration complexity;arbitration latency;high VC occupancy;high frequency many input arbiter design;high frequency many virtual channel router;many VC routers;network on chip routers;network throughput;reduced router clock frequency;speculation opportunity;speculative arbiter design;zero load latency","","1","","18","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the core count increases, the network-on-chip(NoC) topology has changed from buses over rings and fully connected meshes to 2D meshes. The question is which programming paradigm provides the scalability needed to ensure performance is close to theoretical peak, where 2D meshes provide the most scalable design to date. This work contributes NoCMsg, a low-level message passing abstraction over NoCs. NoCMsg is specifically designed for large core counts in2D meshes. Its design ensures deadlock free messaging for wormhole Manhattan-path routing over the NoC. Experimental results on the Tile Pro hardware platform show that NoCMsg can significantly reduce communication times by up to 86% for single packet messages and up to40% for larger messages compared to other NoC-based message approaches. Results further demonstrate the potential of NoC messaging to outperform shared memory abstractions by up to 93% as core counts and inter-process communication increase, i.e., we observe that shared memory scales up to about 16 cores while message passing performs well beyond that threshold on this platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first head-on comparison of shared memory and advanced message passing specifically designed for NoCs on an actual hardware platform with larger core counts on a single socket.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846454","Message Passing;Multicore Architectures;Shared Memory","Computer architecture;Hardware;Message passing;Routing;Switches;Synchronization;System recovery","message passing;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip;shared memory systems","2D meshes;NoC topology;NoC-based message passing;NoCMsg;Tile Pro hardware platform;deadlock free messaging;low-level message passing abstraction;network-on-chip topology;programming paradigm;shared memory abstractions;wormhole Manhattan-path routing","","0","","24","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
