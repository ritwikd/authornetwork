Given network and flow knowledge, we first create a well-defined xMAS model for a specific application on a concrete on-chip network. Then the specific xMAS model can be mapped to its network calculus analysis model for which existing QoS analysis techniques can be applied to compute end-to-end delay bound per flow.

"Headfirst sliding routing: A time-based routing scheme for bus-NoC hybrid 3-D architecture","Kagami, T.; Matsutani, H.; Koibuchi, M.; Amano, H.","Keio Univ., Yokohama, Japan","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2013 Seventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20130715","2013","","","1","8","A contact-less approach that connects chips in vertical dimension has a great potential to customize components in 3-D chip multiprocessors (CMPs), assuming card-style components inserted to a single cartridge communicate each other wirelessly using inductive-coupling technology. To simplify the vertical communication interfaces, static Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is used for the vertical broadcast buses, while arbitrary or customized topologies can be used for intra-chip networks. In this paper, we propose the Headfirst sliding routing scheme to overcome the simple static TDMA-based vertical buses. Each vertical bus grants a communication time-slot for different chips at the same time periodically, which means these buses work with different phases. Depending on the current time, packets are routed toward the best vertical bus (elevator) just before the elevator acquires its communication time-slot. Network simulations show that Headfirst sliding routing reduces the communication latency by up to 32.7%, and full-system CMP simulations show that it reduces application execution time by 9.9%. Synthesis results show that the area and critical path delay overheads are modest.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558406","","Couplings;Elevators;Routing;Switches;Time division multiple access;Topology;Wireless communication","microprocessor chips;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip;time division multiple access","3D chip multiprocessor;TDMA;arbitrary topology;bus-NoC hybrid 3D architecture;communication time-slot;contactless approach;customized topology;full-system CMP simulation;headfirst sliding routing;inductive-coupling technology;intrachip network;network simulation;packet routing;static time division multiple access;time-based routing scheme;vertical broadcast buses;vertical communication interface","","0","","30","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Accelerating atomic operations on GPGPUs","Franey, S.; Lipasti, M.","Electr. & Comput.

However, a large portion of the parallel workload space, both in emerging and traditional domains, remains ill-suited for GPGPU deployment due to high reliance on atomic operations, particularly as global synchronization mechanisms. Unlike the sophisticated synchronization primitives available on supercomputers, GPGPU applications must rely on slow atomic operations on shared data. Further, unlike general purpose processors which take advantage of coherent L1 caches to speed up atomic operations, the cost and complexity of coherency on the GPU, coupled with the fact that a GPU's primary revenue stream - graphics rendering - does not benefit, means that new approaches are needed to improve atomics on the GPU. In this paper, we present a mechanism for implementing low-cost coherence and speculative acquisition of atomic data on the GPU that allows applications that utilize atomics to greater extents than is generally accepted practice today, to perform much better than they do on current hardware. As our results show, these unconventional applications can realize non-trivial performance improvements approaching 20% with our proposed system. With this mechanism, the scope of applications that can be accelerated by these commodity, highly-parallel pieces of hardware can be greatly expanded.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558404","","Coherence;Complexity theory;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Synchronization;Wires","cache storage;graphics processing units;mainframes;rendering (computer graphics)","GPGPU;L1 caches;atomic operations;general purpose computing;graphics rendering;supercomputers","","0","","18","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While NoCs provide high and scalable bandwidth, current routing algorithms, such as dimension-ordered routing, suffer from poor load balance, leading to reduced throughput and high latencies. Improving load balance, hence, is critical in future CMP designs where increased latency leads to wasted power and energy waiting for outstanding requests to resolve. Adaptive routing is a known technique to improve load balance, however, prior adaptive routing techniques either use local or regionally aggregated information to form their routing decisions. This paper proposes a new, light-weight, adaptive routing algorithm for on-chip routers based on global link state and congestion information, Global Congestion Awareness (GCA). GCA uses a simple, low-complexity route calculation unit, to calculate paths to their destination without the myopia of local decisions, nor the aggregation of unrelated status information, found in prior designs. In particular GCA outperforms local adaptive routing by 26%, Regional Congestion Awareness (RCA) by 15%, and a recent competing adaptive routing algorithm, DAR, by 8% on average on realistic workloads.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558405","","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Measurement;Ports (Computers);Routing;Vectors","network routing;network-on-chip","CMP design;GCA;NoC;RCA;adaptive routing;congestion information;dimension-ordered routing;global congestion awareness;global link state;light-weight algorithm;load balance;network-on-chip;on-chip router;regional congestion awareness","","3","","17","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At low loads, the CB is power gated, bypassed, and optimized to produce single cycle operation. A novel extension to bubble flow control enables routing deadlock and message dependent deadlock to be avoided with the same mechanism having constant buffer size per router independent of the number of message types. This solution enables end-to-end latency reduction via high radix switches with low overall buffer requirements. Comparisons made with other low latency routers across different topologies show consistent performance improvement, for example 26% improvement in no load latency of a 2D Mesh and 4X improvement in saturation throughput in a 2D-Generalized Hypercube.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558397","","Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Resource management;Routing;System recovery;System-on-chip;Throughput","network routing;network-on-chip","2D-generalized hypercube;bubble flow control;centralized buffer router;centralized elastic bubble router;elastic buffered links;end-to-end latency reduction;high radix NOC;low power router;on-chip network;performance multiplier;router microarchitecture","","4","","25","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose PROBE: Prediction-based Optical Bandwidth Scaling for Energy-efficient NoCs by exploiting the latency/bandwidth trade-off to reduce the static power consumption by increasing the average channel utilization. With a lightweight prediction technique, we scale the bandwidth adaptively to the changing traffic demands while maintaining reasonable performance.

Network-on-chip is a common solution for the interconnection of large processor arrays. Existing analytic models for the performance analysis of network-on-chip often possess a lack of accuracy, if applied for the popular round-robin arbitration scheme. It turns out to be challenging to find an appropriate analytic representation for this apparently simple scheme. In this paper, we propose an accurate service time estimation model that is designed for round-robin arbiters. It is further employed to a queueing model for network-on-chip.

Regardless of all varieties, there has always been a common assumption between them. Most of all known fault-tolerant methods are based on rerouting packets around faults. Rerouting might take place through nonminimal paths which affect the performance significantly not only by taking longer paths but also by creating hotspot around a fault. In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant approach based on using the shortest paths. This method maintains the performance of Networks-on-Chip in the presence of faults. To avoid using non-minimal paths, the router architecture is slightly modified. In the new form of architecture, there is an ability to connect the horizontal and orthogonal links of a faulty router such that healthy routers are kept connected to each other. Based on this architecture, a fault-tolerant routing algorithm is presented which is obviously much simpler than traditional fault-tolerant routing algorithms. According to this algorithm, only the shortest paths are used by packets in the presence of fault. This results retains the performance of NoCs in faulty situations. This algorithm is highly reliable, for an instance, the reliability is more than 99.5% when there are six faulty routers in an 8×8 mesh network.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558401","","Face;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Routing;Switches;Wires","fault tolerance;network routing;network-on-chip","connection retaining structure;fault tolerant routing algorithm;faulty routers;healthy routers;horizontal links;mesh network;minimal path fault tolerant method;network on chip;off chip network;on chip network;orthogonal links;rerouting packet;router architecture","","3","","22","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, failures of the chip will need to be managed to keep high yields of chips manufacturing. In this paper we provide a novel substrate for the on-chip interconnect and for the memory coherence protocol. We take a radical approach when designing the network and memory, by effectively co-designing both. We take into account the visibility of the whole chip resources to the memory controller, which is in charge of providing the appropriate support for virtualization and memory-level fault-tolerance. Then, the network is designed taking into account the memory coherence protocol and providing solutions for the critical communication requirements of memory modules (caches) and processors in a virtualized domain. The coherence protocol is also designed in order to allow its effective use in a virtualized scenario. With our approach, the chip can be fully virtualized on application demand providing total partitioning of core resources and smart use of memory resources. Results demonstrate that our scheme effectively optimizes the utilization of chip resources, allowing the implementation of techniques which can outperform a first-touch policy up to a 6%, reducing LLC misses and enabling LLC fault tolerance.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558410","","Coherence;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Ports (Computers);Routing;Switches;Tiles","cache storage;fault tolerance;network-on-chip","LLC;NoC;cache hierarchy substrate;chip resources virtualization;last-level cache;many-core chip system;memory coherence protocol;memory module;memory-level fault-tolerance;on-chip interconnect","","0","","16","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parallel simulation exploiting multicore and multithreading capabilities of simulation computers is a potential solution. However, current parallel techniques suffer from limited scalability due to the need to synchronize simulation time and the access to shared data structures. This work presents a new approach based on an explicit ordering of simulation tasks so that a maximum of independent tasks are simulated between any dependent tasks.

Scalable Network-on-Chip (NoC) designs are quickly becoming the standard communication framework to replace bus-based networks. However, the conventional metallic interconnects for inter-core communication consume excess energy and lower throughput which are major bottlenecks in NoC architectures. On-chip wireless interconnects can alleviate the power and bandwidth problems of traditional metallic NoCs. In this paper, we propose an adaptable wireless Network-on-Chip architecture (A-WiNoC) that uses adaptable and energy efficient wireless transceivers to improve network power and throughput by adapting channels according to traffic patterns. Our adaptable algorithm uses link utilization statistics to re-allocate wireless channels and a token sharing scheme to fully utilize the wireless bandwidth efficiently. We compare our proposed A-WiNoC to both wireless/electrical topologies with results showing a throughput improvement of 65%, a speedup between 1.4-2.6X on real benchmarks, and an energy savings of 25-35%.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558400","","Bandwidth;CMOS integrated circuits;Market research;Transceivers;Transmitters;Wireless communication;Wires","channel allocation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips;network-on-chip","A-WiNoC;NoC design;adaptive wireless NoC architecture;chip multiprocessor;communication fabric;energy efficiency;intercore communication;link utilization statistics;metallic interconnect;multicore system;network-on-chip design;on-chip wireless interconnect;token sharing scheme;wireless channel reallocation;wireless transceiver","","1","","22","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was realized using probe systems that generate probes for deadlock detection. A probe system includes a probe System Manager (SM) for turning on probe system, a probe Generator (GEN) for generating probes, a Link Selection (LS) connected to a Switch Allocation (SA), which is used for copying the generated probes, transmitting probes backward, and discarding probes when the probes find that the traversal path is just a congestion not a deadlock or when probe congestion occurs. There is also a TB Calculation (TBC) in LS for TB settings. Finally, a probe comparator (PB Comparator) is used for claiming deadlocks. Note that each port except the local one in a router has its own probe system.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558396","","Boolean functions;Clocks;Data structures;Ports (Computers);Probes;Routing;System recovery","network-on-chip","backward probing deadlock detection;link selection;network on chip;probe comparator;probe congestion;probe generator;probe system manager;switch allocation","","0","","2","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On self-tuning networks-on-chip for dynamic network-flow dominance adaptation","Xiaohang Wang; Mak, T.; Mei Yang; Yingtao Jiang; Daneshtalab, M.; Palesi, M.","","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2013 Seventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20130715","2013","","","1","8","Modern networks-on-chip (NoC) systems are required to handle complex run-time traffic patterns and unprecedented applications. Data traffics of these applications are difficult to be fully comprehended at design-time so as to optimize the network design. However, it has been discovered that the majority data flows in a network are dominated by less than 10% of the specific pathways. In this paper, we introduce a method that is capable of identifying critical pathways in a network at run-time and, then, can dynamically reconfigure the network to optimize for the network performance subjected to the identified dominated flows. An online learning and analysis scheme is employed to quickly discover the emerged dominated traffic flows and provides a statistical traffic prediction using regression analysis. The architecture of a self-tuning network is also discussed which can be reconfigured by setting up the identified point-to-point paths for the dominance data flows in large traffic volumes. The merits of this new approach are experimentally demonstrated using comprehensive NoC simulators. Compared to the conventional network architectures over a range of realistic applications, the proposed self-tuning network approach can effectively reduce the latency and power consumption by as much as 25% and 24%, respectively. We also evaluated the configuration time and additional hardware cost. This new approach demonstrates the capability of an adaptive NoC to handle more complex and dynamic applications.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558418","networks-on-chips;reconfigurable;regression;self-tuning","Benchmark testing;Control systems;Data models;Electronic mail;Pipelines;Polynomials;Predictive models","network-on-chip;performance evaluation;regression analysis","NoC systems;analysis scheme;capability;complex run-time traffic patterns;comprehensive NoC simulators;critical pathways;data traffics;design-time;dominance data flows;dominated traffic flows;dynamic network-flow dominance adaptation;hardware cost;identified dominated flows;majority data flows;network architectures;network design;network performance;online learning;point-to-point paths;power consumption;regression analysis;self-tuning network approach;self-tuning networks-on-chip;statistical traffic prediction;traffic volumes","","5","","20","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A greedy approach for latency-bounded deadlock-free routing path allocation for application-specific NoCs","Verma, A.; Multani, P.S.; Mueller-Gritschneder, D.; Todorov, V.; Schlichtmann, U.","","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2013 Seventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20130715","2013","","","1","7","Custom network-on-chip (NoC) structures have improved power and area metrics compared to regular NoC topologies for application-specific systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). The synthesis of an application-specific NoC is a combinatorial problem. This paper presents a novel heuristic for solving the routing path allocation step. Its main advantages are the support of realistic nonlinear cost estimation and the ability to handle latency constraints, which guarantee high performance of processing elements sensitive to communication delays. Additionally, the method generates deadlock-free routing by avoiding cycles in the channel dependency graph. The NoC is constructed sequentially in a greedy manner by selecting the routing path for each communication flow in such a way that the additional NoC HW resources are kept minimal. The routing path is found using a binary search cheapest bounded path (BSCBP) algorithm. The method is highly efficient and provides a NoC routing path allocation for a smart phone SoC with 25 processing elements and 96 flows in less than a minute.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558417","","Delays;Hardware;Ports (Computers);Resource management;Routing;System recovery;System-on-chip","graph theory;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip;search problems","BSCBP algorithm;NoC HW resource;NoC routing path allocation;NoC structure;NoC topology;application-specific NoC synthesis;application-specific systems-on-a-chip;area metric;binary search cheapest bounded path;channel dependency graph;combinatorial problem;communication delay;communication flow;greedy approach;latency constraint;latency-bounded deadlock-free routing path allocation;network-on-chip;power metric;processing element;realistic nonlinear cost estimation;smart phone SoC","","1","","16","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A speculative arbiter design to enable high-frequency many-VC router in NoCs","Bo Zhao; Youtao Zhang; Jun Yang","Dept. of ECE, Univ. of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2013 Seventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20130715","2013","","","1","8","High-performance network-on-chip routers usually prefer a large number of Virtual Channels (VC) for high throughput. However, the growth in VC count results in increased arbitration complexity and reduced router clock frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel high-frequency many-input arbiter design for many-VC routers. It is based on the speculation on short and thus fast arbitrations in case of high VC occupancy. We further enhance it to reduce arbitration latency and promote speculation opportunity. Simulation results show that using the proposed arbiter, a 16-VC router achieves almost the same performance as an ideal design, showing improvements of around 48% on zero-load latency and 100% on network throughput over a naive 16-VC design.","","978-1-4673-6491-1","978-1-4673-6492-8","10.1109/NoCS.2013.6558415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558415","","Clocks;Delays;Organizations;Ports (Computers);Routing;Throughput;Wires","network-on-chip","NoC;arbitration complexity;arbitration latency;high VC occupancy;high frequency many input arbiter design;high frequency many virtual channel router;many VC routers;network on chip routers;network throughput;reduced router clock frequency;speculation opportunity;speculative arbiter design;zero load latency","","1","","18","","","21-24 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
