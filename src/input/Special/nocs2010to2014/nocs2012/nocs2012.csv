Strategies have been proposed to tolerate faulty wires by replacing them with spare ones or by partially using the defective links. However, these strategies either suffer from high area and power overheads, or significantly increase the average network latency. In this paper, we propose a novel flit serialization method, which divides the links and flits into several sections, and serializes flit sections of adjacent flits to transmit them on all available fault-free link sections to avoid the complete waste of defective links bandwidth. Experimental results indicate that our method reduces the latency overhead significantly and enables graceful performance degradation, when compared with related partially faulty link usage proposals, and saves area and power overheads by up to 29% and 43.1%, respectively, when compared with spare wire replacement methods.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209271","Networks-on-Chip;flit serialization;partially faulty link usage;permanent error","Error correction codes;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Receivers;Registers;Vectors;Wires","MOS integrated circuits;fault diagnosis;fault trees;integrated circuit reliability;network-on-chip","MOS transistor size scaling;chip wire-out effect;defective links bandwidth;fault free link section;flit serialization strategy;manufacturing defect;network-on-chip;partially faulty links;process variation;serializes flit section","","2","","17","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, the bandwidth provided in NoCs is over provisioned for their typical usage case. In real-world multi-core applications, less than 5% of channels are utilized on average. Large bandwidth resources serve to keep network latency low during periods of peak communication demands. Increasing the average channel utilization through narrower channels could improve the efficiency of NoCs in terms of area and power, however, in current NoC architectures this degrades overall system performance. Based on thorough analysis of the dynamic behaviour of real workloads, we design a novel NoC architecture that adapts to changing application demands. Our architecture uses fine-grained bandwidth-adaptive bidirectional channels to improve channel utilization without negatively affecting network latency. Running PARSEC benchmarks on a cycle-accurate full-system simulator, we show that fine-grained bandwidth adaptivity can save up to 75% of channel resources while achieving 92% of overall system performance compared to the baseline network, no performance is sacrificed in our network design configured with 50% of the channel resources used in the baseline.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209272","Network-on-Chip;NoC;bandwidth adaptive;bidirectional channel;channel utilization;channel width;phit-serial","Bandwidth;Clocks;Computer architecture;Delay;Switches;System performance;Wires","network-on-chip","NoC architecture;PARSEC benchmarks;cycle-accurate full-system simulator;fine-grained bandwidth adaptivity;fine-grained bandwidth-adaptive bidirectional channels;networks-on-chip","","5","","20","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to exploit the intrinsic capability of reducing the wire length in 3D ICs, 3D NoC-Bus Hybrid mesh architecture was proposed which provides performance, power consumption, and area benefits. Besides its various advantages, this architecture has a unique and hitherto previously unexplored way to implement an efficient system-wide monitoring network. In this paper, an integrated low-cost monitoring platform for 3D stacked mesh architectures is proposed which can be efficiently used for various system management purposes such as traffic monitoring, thermal management and fault tolerance. The proposed generic monitoring and management infrastructure called ARB-NET utilizes bus arbiters to exchange the monitoring information directly with each other without using the data network. As a test case, based on the proposed monitoring and management platform, a fully congestion-aware and inter-layer fault tolerant routing algorithm named AdaptiveXYZ is presented taking advantage of viable information generated using bus arbiter network. In addition, we propose a thermal monitoring and management strategy on top of our ARB-NET infrastructure. Compared to recently proposed stacked mesh 3D NoCs, our extensive simulations with synthetic and real benchmarks reveal that our architecture using the AdaptiveXYZ routing can help in achieving significant power and performance improvements while preserving the system reliability with negligible hardware overhead.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209277","3D ICs;3D NoC-Bus Hybrid Architecture;Adaptive Routing Algorithm;Fault Tolerance;Monitoring Infrastructure;Thermal Management","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Routing;Stress;Thermal management;Three dimensional displays","fault tolerance;hybrid integrated circuits;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit reliability;network routing;network-on-chip;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D NOC-bus hybrid architectures;3D stacked mesh architectures;AdaptiveXYZ;bus arbiter network;congestion-aware;enhanced system integration;generic monitoring;integrated low-cost monitoring platform;inter-layer fault tolerant routing algorithm;intrinsic capability;management infrastructure;management strategy;system reliability;thermal monitoring;three-dimensional integrated circuits","","6","","15","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, we provide an advanced interface that enables the replacement of the original lightweight but optimistic GEMS and GEM5 network simulator with limited performance impact on the simulation time. Our tests indicate that in this context, underestimating network modeling could induce up to 50% error in the performance estimation of the simulated system. To minimize the impact of detailed network modeling on simulation time, we incorporate mechanisms able to attenuate the higher computational effort, reducing in this way the slowdown of the full system simulation with accurate performance estimations. Additionally, in order to evaluate large-scale networks, we parallelize the simulator to be able to optimize memory resources with the growing number of cores available per chip in the simulation farms. This allows us to simulate node networks exceeding one million of routers with up to 70% efficiency in a multithreaded simulation running on twelve cores.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209268","chip multiprocessor;interconnection networks;simulator;supercomputer","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Garnets;Load modeling;Multiprocessor interconnection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;multiprocessor interconnection networks;parallel architectures;parallel machines","GEM5 network simulator;GEMS network simulator;TOPAZ;application traces;chip multiprocessors;computer architecture;multithreaded simulation;network modeling;node networks;open-source interconnection network simulator;performance estimation;supercomputer interconnection networks;synthetic traffic patterns","","9","","32","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These messages may be classified into critical and non-critical messages. Hence, instead of having one interconnect plane to serve all traffic, power can be saved if the NoC is split into two planes: a fast plane dedicated to the critical messages and a slower, more power-efficient plane dedicated only to the non-critical messages. This split, however, can be beneficial to save energy only if system performance is not significantly degraded by the slower plane. In this work we first motivate the need for a timely delivery of the ""non-critical"" messages. Second, we propose Déjà Vu switching, a simple algorithm that enables reducing the voltage and frequency of one plane while reducing communication latency through circuit switching and support of advance, possibly conflicting, circuit reservations. Finally, we study the constraints that govern how slow the power-efficient plane can operate without negatively impacting system performance.

"MinBD: Minimally-Buffered Deflection Routing for Energy-Efficient Interconnect","Fallin, C.; Nazario, G.; Xiangyao Yu; Chang, K.; Ausavarungnirun, R.; Mutlu, O.","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2012 Sixth IEEE/ACM International Symposium on","20120531","2012","","","1","10","A conventional Network-on-Chip (NoC) router uses input buffers to store in-flight packets. These buffers improve performance, but consume significant power. It is possible to bypass these buffers when they are empty, reducing dynamic power, but static buffer power, and dynamic power when buffers are utilized, remain. To improve energy efficiency, buffer less deflection routing removes input buffers, and instead uses deflection (misrouting) to resolve contention. However, at high network load, deflections cause unnecessary network hops, wasting power and reducing performance. In this work, we propose a new NoC router design called the minimally-buffered deflection (MinBD) router. This router combines deflection routing with a small ""side buffer,"" which is much smaller than conventional input buffers. A MinBD router places some network traffic that would have otherwise been deflected in this side buffer, reducing deflections significantly. The router buffers only a fraction of traffic, thus making more efficient use of buffer space than a router that holds every flit in its input buffers. We evaluate MinBD against input-buffered routers of various sizes that implement buffer bypassing, a buffer less router, and a hybrid design, and show that MinBD is more energy efficient than all prior designs, and has performance that approaches the conventional input-buffered router with area and power close to the buffer less router.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209256","","Frequency control;Pipelines;Routing;Routing protocols;Silver;System recovery","integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC router design;buffer bypassing;buffer space;energy-efficient interconnect;hybrid design;input-buffered router;minimally-buffered deflection router;minimally-buffered deflection routing;network traffic;router buffer","","6","","40","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we consider a practical system architecture where the distributed LLC and the NoC share a voltage/frequency domain which is separate from the core domain. This architecture enables controlling the relative speed between the cores and memory hierarchy without introducing synchronization delays within the NoC. DVFS for this architecture is more difficult than individual link/core-based DVFS since it involves spatially distributed monitoring and control. We propose an average memory access time (AMAT)-based monitoring technique and integrate it with DVFS based on PID control theory.

Using high-density memories in input buffers helps to reduce the bottleneck through increasing throughput. Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) can be a suitable solution due to its nature of high density and near-zero leakage power. But its long latency and high power consumption in write operations still need to be addressed. We explore the design issues in using STT-MRAM for NoC input buffers. Motivated by short intra-router latency, we use the previously proposed write latency reduction technique sacrificing retention time. Then we propose a hybrid design of input buffers using both SRAM and STT-MRAM to hide the long write latency efficiently. Considering that simple data migration in the hybrid buffer consumes more dynamic power compared to SRAM, we provide a lazy migration scheme that reduces the dynamic power consumption of the hybrid buffer. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the throughput by 21% on average.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209279","Network-on-Chip;STT-MRAM;input buffer;router","Computer architecture;Magnetic tunneling;Power demand;Random access memory;Switches;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","SRAM chips;buffer storage;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","NoC input buffers;SRAM;STT-MRAM;chip multiprocessor design;communication delay;data migration;dynamic power consumption;hybrid buffer design;intrarouter latency;many-core architectures;near-zero leakage power;network-on-chip;on-chip interconnects;retention time;spin-torque transfer magnetic RAM;write latency reduction technique","","2","","22","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As CMPs become more complex, the memory subsystem is organized into more hierarchical structures to better exploit locality. During the exploration and design of CMP architectures, it is essential to efficiently analyze their performance. However, performance is highly determined by the latency of the memory subsystem, which in turn has a cyclic dependency with the memory traffic generated by the cores. This paper proposes a scalable analytical method to estimate the performance of highly parallel CMPs (hundreds of cores) with hierarchical interconnect fabrics. The method can use customizable probabilistic models and solves the cyclic dependencies by using a fixed-point strategy.

For example, in on-chip networks, multiple flows can compete for links and buffers. We show that this interference is an attack vector through which a malicious application may be able to infer data-dependent information about other applications (side channel attacks), or two applications can exchange information covertly when direct communications are prohibited (covert channel attacks). To prevent these timing channel attacks, we propose an efficient scheme which uses priority-based arbitration and a static limit mechanism to provide one-way information-leak protection.

In these architectures, on-chip inter-connects play a pivotal role in ensuring power and performance scalability. As supply voltages begin to level off in future technologies, chip designs in general and interconnects in particular will require specialization to meet power and performance objectives. In this work, we make the observation that cache-coherent many core server chips exhibit a duality in on-chip network traffic. Request traffic largely consists of simple control messages, while response traffic often carries cache-block-sized payloads. We present Cache-Coherence Network-on-Chip (CCNoC), a design that specializes the NoC to fit the demands of server workloads via a pair of asymmetric networks tuned to the type of traffic traversing them. The networks differ in their data path width, router micro architecture, flow control strategy, and delay. The resulting heterogeneous CCNoC architecture enables significant gains in power efficiency over conventional NoC designs at similar performance levels. Our evaluation reveals that a 4×4 mesh-based chip multiprocessor with the proposed CCNoC organization running commercial server workloads is 15-28% more energy efficient than various state-of-the-art single- and dual-network organizations.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209264","","Coherence;Network topology;Organizations;Routing protocols;Servers;System recovery","integrated circuit interconnections;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip","Moore's Law;asymmetric networks;cache-coherence network-on-chip;cache-coherent servers;dual-network organizations;energy efficiency;mesh-based chip multiprocessor;on-chip interconnects;on-chip network traffic;router micro architecture;server workloads;single-network organizations","","7","","26","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dynamic regulation is made possible by employing a sliding window based online flow ($sigma$, $rho$) characterization technique, where $sigma$ bounds traffic burstiness and $rho$ reflects the average rate. The characterization method is effective and can be implemented in hardware with small area and high speed. The resulting dynamic regulation can adaptively adjust the traffic regulation strength in response to real traffic workload scenarios. As such, it makes more efficient use of the system interconnect resources, leading to significant improvement in network performance.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209270","Flow Regulation;IP Integration;Network-on-Chip (NoC)","","","","","1","","23","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In high-end MPSoC systems, fault tolerance support is becoming a compulsory feature. In this work, we propose a combined method to address permanent and transient link and router failures in those systems. The LBDRhr mechanism is proposed to tolerate permanent link failures in some popular high-radix topologies. The increased router complexity may lead to more transient router errors than routers using simple XY routing algorithm. We exploit the inherent information redundancy (IIR) in LBDRhr logic to manage transient errors in the network routers. Thorough analyses are provided to discover the appropriate internal nodes and the forbidden signal patterns for transient error detection. Simulation results show that LBDRhr logic can tolerate all of the permanent failure combinations of long-range links and 80% of links failures at short-range links. Case studies show that the error detection method based on the new IIR extraction method reduces the power consumption and the residual error rate by 33% and up to two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to triple modular redundancy. The impact of network topologies on the efficiency of the detection mechanism has been examined in this work, as well.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209276","Networks-on-chip;arbiter;fault tolerant;information redundancy;permanent error;reliability;transient error","Logic gates;Network topology;Redundancy;Routing;Topology;Transient analysis","circuit complexity;digital arithmetic;error detection;error statistics;fault tolerance;logic design;multiprocessing systems;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip;redundancy","IIR extraction method;LBDRhr logic;LBDRhr mechanism;XY routing algorithm;built-in high-radix topology;combined method;compulsory feature;connectivity;detection mechanism;error detection method;fault tolerance support;forbidden signal patterns;high-end MPSoC systems;high-end multiprocessor systems-on-chip;inherent information redundancy;internal nodes;long-range links;network diameter;network routers;network topology;permanent error control;permanent failure combinations;permanent link failures;popular high-radix topology;power consumption;residual error rate;router complexity;router failures;short-range links;thorough analyses;transient error control;transient error detection;transient errors;transient link;transient router errors;triple modular redundancy","","2","","25","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, reproducing all the components of such complex systems precisely would require unreasonable amounts of computing power. Hence, a trade off between accuracy and compute time is needed. For this reason most state-of-the-art tools do not have accurate models for the networks-on-chip, and rely on timing models that permit fast-simulation. Generally, these models are very simplistic and disregard contention for the use of network resources. As the number of nodes in the network-on-chip grows, fluctuations with contention and other parameters can considerably affect the accuracy of such models. In this paper we present and evaluate a collection of timing models based on a reservation scheme which consider the contention for the use of network resources. These models provide results quickly while being more accurate than simple no-contention approaches.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209267","Modelling;Network-on-chip;performance evaluation;simulation;timing models","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Load modeling;Program processors;Timing","integrated circuit modelling;network-on-chip","complex systems;computing power;large-scale architectural simulation;many-core chips;network resources;reservation based network-on-chip timing models","","2","","39","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In turn, such multi-VFI architectures need efficient, robust, and accurate run-time control mechanisms that can exploit the workload characteristics in order to save power. Despite being tractable, the linear control models for power management cannot capture some important workload characteristics (e.g., fractality, non-stationarity) observed in heterogeneous NoCs, if ignored, such characteristics lead to inefficient communication and resources allocation, as well as high power dissipation in MPSoCs. To mitigate such limitations, we propose a new paradigm shift from power optimization based on linear models to control approaches based on fractal-state equations. As such, our approach is the first to propose a controller for fractal workloads with precise constraints on state and control variables and specific time bounds. Our results show that significant power savings (about 70%) can be achieved at run-time while running a variety of benchmark applications.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209260","Finite Horizon Optimal Control;Fractal Workloads;Networks-on-Chip;Power Management","Equations;Fractals;Frequency control;Mathematical model;Multicore processing;Optimal control;Power demand","energy consumption;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;optimal control;resource allocation","control variables;energy consumption;fractal workloads;fractal-state equations;frequency islands multiprocessor platforms;highly variable workloads;linear control models;multiVFI architectures;multiple voltage/frequency island-based designs;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;network-on-chip;optimal control approach;power management;power optimization;resources allocation;run-time control mechanisms;state variables;time bounds;workload characteristics","","8","","40","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Hammer coherency protocol is appealing as it eliminates most of the space overhead when compared to a directory protocol. However, it generates much more traffic, thus stressing the NoC and having worse performance in terms of power consumption. When using a NoC with built-in broadcast support network utilization is lowered but does not solve completely the problem as acknowledgment messages are still sent from each core to the memory access requestor. In this paper we propose a simple control network that collects the acknowledgement messages and delivers them with a bounded and fixed latency, thus relieving the NoC from a large amount of messages. Experimental results demonstrate on a 16-tile system with the control network that execution time improves up to 17%, with an average improvement of about 7.5%. The control network has negligible impact on area when compared to the switches.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209263","","Coherence;Control systems;Delay;Logic gates;Protocols;Tiles;Wires","cache storage;memory protocols;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","16-tile system;Hammer coherency protocol;broadcast support network utilization;cached data;directory protocol;execution time;main memory;memory access coherence;memory access requestor;space overhead","","4","","27","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel hierarchical NoC (H-NoC) architecture for SNN hardware which addresses the scalability issue by creating a 3-dimensional array of clusters of neurons with a hierarchical structure of low and high-level routers. The H-NoC architecture also incorporates a spike traffic compression technique to exploit SNN traffic patterns, thus reducing traffic overhead and improving throughput on the network. In addition, adaptive routing capabilities between clusters balance local and global traffic loads to sustain throughput under bursting activity. Simulation results show a high throughput per cluster (3.33×10<sup>9</sup> spikes/second), and synthesis results using 65-nm CMOS technology demonstrate low cost area (0.587mm<sup>2</sup>) and power consumption (13.16mW @100MHz) for a single cluster of 400 neurons, which outperforms existing SNN hardware strategies.","","978-1-4673-0973-8","","10.1109/NOCS.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209266","adaptive routing;hierarchical architecture;network topology;network-on-chip;spiking neural networks","Computer architecture;Hardware;Neurons;Registers;Routing;Tiles;Topology","CMOS integrated circuits;network-on-chip;neural nets","CMOS technology;hierarchical network-on-chip;interneuron connectivity;size 65 nm;spiking neural network implementations;three-dimensional array;traffic compression","","2","","23","","","9-11 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In mesh topology, minimal methods can propagate messages over two directions at each switch. When shortest paths are congested, sending more messages through them can deteriorate the congestion condition considerably. In this paper, we present an adaptive routing algorithm for on-chip networks that provide a wide range of alternative paths between each pair of source and destination switches. Initially, the algorithm determines all permitted turns in the network including 180-degree turns on a single channel without creating cycles. The implementation of the algorithm provides the best usage of all allowable turns to route messages more adaptively in the network. On top of that, for selecting a less congested path, an optimized and scalable learning method is utilized.

Photonic interconnects is a disruptive technology solution that is capable of delivering the communication bandwidth at low power dissipation when the number of cores is scaled to large numbers. Similarly, 3D stacking is another interconnect technology solution that can lead to low energy/bit for communication. In this paper, we propose to combine photonic interconnects with 3D stacking to develop a scalable, reconfigurable, power-efficient and high-performance interconnect for future many-core systems, called R-3PO (Reconfigurable 3D-Photonic Networks-on-Chip). We propose to develop a multi-layer photonic interconnect that can dynamically reconfigure without system intervention and allocate channel bandwidth from less utilized links to more utilized communication links. In addition to improving performance, reconfiguration can re-allocate bandwidth around faulty channels, thereby increasing the resiliency of the architecture and gracefully degrading performance. For 64-core reconfigured network, our simulation results indicate that the performance can be further improved by 10%-25% for Splash-2, PARSEC and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, where as simulation results for 256-core chip indicate a performance improvement of more than 25% while saving 6%-36% energy when compared to state-of-the-art on-chip electrical and optical networks.","1072-4451","978-1-4673-4819-5","","10.1109/MICRO.2012.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6493627","Fault Tolerance;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Photonic;Reconfiguration","","bandwidth allocation;fault tolerance;integrated optics;network-on-chip;optical interconnections;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D photonic network-on-chip dynamic reconfiguration;3D stacking;64-core reconfigured network;NoC;PARSEC;R-3PO;SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks;Splash-2;channel bandwidth allocation;communication bandwidth;communication links;fault tolerance;high-performance interconnect;low power dissipation;many-core systems;multilayer photonic interconnect;on-chip electrical networks;optical networks;photonic interconnects;power dissipation;power-efficient interconnect;reconfigurable 3D-photonic network-on-chip","","4","","32","","","1-5 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
