Three-dimensional integration, on-chip photonic, RF and wireless links have been proposed as radical low-power and low-latency alternatives to the conventional planar wire-based designs.

When a destination node is overloaded, it starts pushing back the packets destined for it, which in turns blocks the packets destined for other nodes. How to detect the occurrence(s) of hotspot and notify all source nodes to regulate their traffic to the hotspot node(s) can be quite complex because of potentially high volume of information to be collected and the non-negligible latency between the detection point of congestion and the source nodes. In this paper, we propose an effective end-to-end flow control scheme, called HOPE (HOtspot PrEvention), to resolve the hotspot congestion problem for the Clos network on the chip (CNOC). Specifically, HOPE regulates the injected traffic rate proactively by estimating the number of packets inside the switch network destined for each destination and applying a simple stop-and-go protocol to prevent hotspot traffic from jamming the internal links of the network.

In addition, the advent of massive-scale multicore architectures, novel silicon and non-silicon manufacturing techniques (such as self-assembly), and an increasing interest in biological components for computing force us to rethink, re-evaluate, and re-design the communication infrastructure and the communication paradigms in the era of nano- and biotechnology.

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to application-aware routing cannot efficiently handle dynamic changes in the traffic pattern limiting its usefulness in practice. In this paper, we study application-aware routing under traffic uncertainty. Our problem formulation allows an application to statically specify an uncertainty set of traffic patterns that each occur with a given probability, and our goal is to find a single set of combined routes that will enable high-performance across all of these traffic patterns. We show how efficient combined routes can be found for this problem using convex optimization. These combined routes are optimal when the performance for every traffic pattern using the combined routes is the same as the performance using routes that are specialized for just that traffic pattern. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for when our optimization framework will find optimal combined routes. We use theoretical and numerical analysis for the important class of permutation traffic patterns to quantify how often optimal combined routes exist and to determine the performance loss when optimal combined routes are infeasible. Finally, we use a cycle-level simulator that includes realistic pipeline latencies, arbitration, and buffered flow-control to study the latency and throughput of combined routes compared to specialized routes and routes generated using general-purpose routing algorithms.

The target network topology is a variant Mesh-of-Trees (MoT), combining a binary fan-out network (i.e. routing) and a binary fan-in network (i.e. arbitration) for each source-sink pair. The key feature of the new arbitration node is that it dynamically reconfigures based on the traffic it receives, entering a special â€œsingle-channel-biasâ€ù mode when the other channel has no recent activity. Arbitration is totally bypassed on the critical path, resulting in significantly lower node latency and, in high-traffic scenarios, improved throughput. The router nodes were implemented in IBM 90nm technology using ARM standard cells. SPICE simulations indicate that the bi-modal arbitration node provided significant reductions in latency (41.6%), and increased throughput (19.8%, in high-traffic single-channel scenarios), when in biased mode. Node reconfiguration required at most 338 ps. Simulations were then performed on two distinct MoT indirect networks, â€œbaselineâ€ù and â€œadaptiveâ€ù (the latter incorporating the new bi-modal node), on eight diverse synthetic benchmarks, using mixes of random and deterministic traffic. Improvements in system latency up to 19.8% and throughput up to 27.8% were obtained using the adaptive network.

Instead, our method exploits existing information redundancy in the router, significantly reducing the area overhead and power consumption compared to triple-modular redundancy (TMR).

To address this challenge we propose DART, a fast and flexible FPGA-based NoC simulation architecture. Rather than laying the NoC out in hardware on the FPGA like previous approaches, our design virtualizes the NoC by mapping its components to a generic NoC simulation engine, composed of a fully-connected collection of fundamental components (e.g., routers and flit queues). This approach has two main advantages: (i) since FPGA implementation is decoupled it can simulate any NoC; and (ii) any NoC can be mapped to the engine without resynthesizing it, which can take time for a large FPGA design.

The resulting latency estimator can accurately capture subtle load-dependent behaviors of a NoC but is much simpler than a full-blown execution-driven model. We study two variations of FIST in the context of a software-based, cycle-level simulation of a tiled chip-multiprocessor (CMP).

Stateful pipeline buffers added to long links allow a higher clock rate, but this wastes resources on links needing only low bandwidth. In asynchronous (clockless) NoCs, link pipelining can be done to only those that will benefit from both increased throughput and buffering capacity, and is especially useful in heterogeneous embedded SoCs. We evaluate two strategies that determine where link pipeline buffers should be placed in the topology. The first compares available link bandwidth, based on physical wirelength, to the throughput needed by each source-to-destination path, for each link. The second adds buffers to a link such that its bandwidth is at least equal to the throughput of a core's network adapter. These strategies were integrated into our network optimization tool for an application-specific SoC. Simulations were based on its expected traffic patterns, floorplan-derived wirelength, and uses self-similar traffic generation for more realistic behavior. Results show improved large-message network latency and output buffer delay of the network adapter. There was a slight power increase with the addition of pipeline buffers, but our proposal is a complexity-effective improvement by the power*latency product metric. The results indicate the strategy of pipelining certain links provides more efficiency opposed to a ubiquitous addition of buffers.",,,978-1-4503-0720-8,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948562,,Bandwidth;Pipeline processing;Synchronization;System-on-a-chip;Throughput;Topology;Wires,asynchronous circuits;buffer circuits;network-on-chip;pipeline processing,application-specific asynchronous NoC;buffer delay;buffering capacity;complexity-effective improvement;deep submicron technology;floorplan-derived wirelength;heterogeneous embedded SoC;large-message network latency;link pipelining buffer strategy;self-similar traffic generation;source-to-destination path;wire latency,,1,,,,,1-4 May 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications[Title page],"Dan Zhao; Yi Wang; Jian Li; Kikkawa, T.","Center for Adv.

The main advantage lies in the exploitation of parallelism, distributively and massively. Consequently, the on-chip communication fabric becomes the performance determinant. In the meantime, the introduction of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) interconnect brings in the new opportunity for giga-bps communication bandwidth, milliwatts communication power, and low cost implementation for millimeter range on-chip communication for future chip generations. In this paper, we study multi-channel wireless Network-on-Chip (McWiNoC) with ultra-short RF/wireless links for multi-hop communication. We first present the benefit of high bandwidth, low latency and flexible topology configurations provided by this new on-chip inter-connection network. We then propose a distributed and deadlock-free location based routing scheme. We further design an efficient channel arbitration scheme to grant multi-channel access. With a few representative synthetic traffic patterns and SPLASH-II benchmarks, we demonstrate that McWiNoC can achieve 23.3% average performance improvement and 65.3% average end-to-end latency reduction over a baseline NoC of 8 Ã— 8 metal wired mesh.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948550,,,logic design;network routing;network-on-chip,McWiNoC;SPLASH-II benchmark;UWB interconnect;channel arbitration scheme;deadlock-free location based routing scheme;distributed routing scheme;end-to-end latency reduction;many-core chip design;multichannel wireless NoC;multihop communication;on-chip communication capacity;synthetic traffic pattern;ultra-short RF/wireless link;ultra-wideband interconnect,,0,,,,,1-4 May 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference PublicationsA distributed and topology-agnostic approach for on-line NoC testing,"Kakoee, M.R.; Bertacco, V.; Benini, L.","DEIS, Univ. of Bologna, Bologna, Italy","Networks on Chip (NoCS), 2011 Fifth IEEE/ACM International Symposium on",20110711,2011,,,113,120,"A new distributed on-line test mechanism for NoCs is proposed which scales to large-scale networks with general topologies and routing algorithms. Each router and its links are tested using neighbors in different phases. Only the router under test is in test mode and all other parts of the NoC are in functional mode. Experimental results show that our on-line test approach can detect stuck-at and short-wire faults in the routers and links. Our approach achieves 100% fault coverage for the data-path and 85% for the control paths including routing logic, FIFO's control path and the arbiter of a 5Ã—5 router. Synthesis results show that the hardware overhead of our test components with TMR (Triple Module Redundancy) support is 20% for covering both stuck-at and short-wire faults and 7% for covering only stuck-at faults in the 5Ã—5 router.

First, we examine a traditional microarchitecture that implements the matching decision of each input and each output of the crossbar in a separate arbiter block and communicates the matching decisions between the input and the output arbiters through global point-to-point links. Using simple models and experimentation with 90nm CMOS layouts, we show that this architecture is expensive because the global point-to-point links take up O(N<sup>4</sup>) area, where N the radix of the crossbar. Next, by observing that the wiring of an arbiter fits in a minimal O(NlogN) area, we propose a novel microarchitecture that inverts the locality of wires by orthogonally interleaving the input with the output arbiters, thus lowering the wiring area of the scheduler down to O(N<sup>2</sup>log<sup>2</sup>N). Using this architecture, the scheduler for a radix-128 FIFO, VOQ, or 2-VC crossbar becomes gate limited, fitting in 3.6, 7.2, and 7.2mm<sup>2</sup> respectively, which is a 40, 50, and 70% improvement compared to the traditional. Moreover, the proposed schedulers find a new match in less than 10ns, thus allowing a minimum packet below 30Bytes at 24Gb/s line rate. Based on these findings, we conclude that crossbar schedulers are feasible even for radices above 100.",,,978-1-4503-0720-8,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948567,ASICs;Crossbar;Parallel Iterative Matching,Algorithm design and analysis;Layout,CMOS logic circuits;VLSI;asynchronous circuits;digital arithmetic;integrated circuit layout;multiprocessor interconnection networks;network-on-chip,2-VC crossbar;CMOS layouts;VLSI microarchitecture;VOQ;arbiter block;high-radix crossbar scheduler;matching decision;orthogonal interleaver;parallel-matching crossbar scheduler;point to point links;radix-128 FIFO;size 90 nm;virtual channel;virtual output queues,,0,,,,,1-4 May 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications"Congestion aware, fault tolerant, and thermally efficient inter-layer communication scheme for hybrid NoC-bus 3D architectures","Rahmani, A.-M.; Liljeberg, P.; Latif, K.; Plosila, J.; Vaddina, K.R.; Tenhunen, H.","Turku Centre for Comput.

Stacked mesh is a feasible architecture which provides both performance and area benefits, while suffering from inefficient intermediate buffers. In this paper, an efficient architecture to optimize system performance, power consumption, and reliability of stacked mesh 3D NoC is proposed. The mechanism benefits from a congestion-aware and bus failure tolerant routing algorithm called AdaptiveZ for vertical communication. In addition, we hybridize the proposed adaptive routing with available algorithms to mitigate the thermal issues by herding most of the switching activities closer to the heat sink.
