"An HDL-based system design methodology for multistandard RF SoC's","Atac, A.; Zhimiao Chen; Lei Liao; Yifan Wang; Schleyer, M.; Ye Zhang; Wunderlich, R.; Heinen, S.","Integrated Analog Circuit & RF Syst., RWTH Aachen Univ., Aachen, Germany","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20140821","2014","","","1","6","Multistandard SoC's including advanced RF and analog circuitry with digital blocks are pervasive in modern IC's. However, the system design and verification methodologies that capture the complexity of multistandard RF SoC's are still limited. In this paper, an HDL design methodology is introduced for multistandard RF SoC's, which covers all the design layers from system design, to automatic extraction of the models from circuits and a systematic top level verification. The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology. The accuracy of the system level simulations show a very good match with the measurement results after fabrication. The test SoC is fabricated with 0.13 ?m CMOS technology.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881494","Bluetooth;Bluetooth Low Energy;RF SoC;SoC;SoC design;SoC verification;analog modeling;system methodology","Design methodology;Hardware design languages;Integrated circuit modeling;Radio frequency;Receivers;System-on-chip;Transistors","Bluetooth;CMOS integrated circuits;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;system-on-chip;transceivers","APX tool;CMOS technology;HDL-based system design methodology;IC;analog circuitry;automatic parameter extraction tool;digital block;hardware description language;multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC;multistandard RF SoC;size 0.13 mum;systematic top block level verification;time 8 month","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Metasynthesis for Designing Automotive SoCs","Ecker, W.; Velten, M.; Zafari, L.; Goyal, A.","Syst.-Level & Verification, Infineon Technol., Munich, Germany","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20140821","2014","","","1","6","Designing Automotive SoCs requires product specific support of one or more different design targets as different degrees of safety, reliability, very low power, or high current support as well as different design features as multi-core, sensor-on-chip, or system-in-package. Considering that wide design space, it's clear that EDA industry that is focusing on generic applicable tools leaves a wide field for automation unsupported. This paper presents a novel approach to system synthesis named Metasynthesis. It proposes a new highly flexible methodology based on synthesizing system synthesis tools. These synthesized tools finally make the synthesis step from a description above implementation level, e.g. requirements, specification, or a domain specific description to implementation level, e.g. C, SystemVerilog-RTL or schematic. The name “Meta”-Synthesis was chosen in the sense of a synthesis tool “beyond” another synthesis tool or as already said a synthesis tool synthesizing another synthesis tool. The term “Meta” also reflects the underlying metamodeling technique. Even if the approach requires additional effort in building the system synthesis tool, it helps to shorten overall design time, since building the tool is highly automated due to the presented Metasynthesis approach. Also the input views are fast to make since they can be kept simple and compact. The Metasynthesis approach was proven so far in over 90 different automotive SoC and other applications gaining productivity improvements of 95% considering single design steps and gaining up to 70% effort reduction for the complete implementation of automotive SoCs. Some designers report, that they generate up to 80% of the chip's overall RTL code with synthesized tools.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881398","code generation;design productivity;metamodeling;metasynthesis;system level synthesis","Analytical models;Automotive engineering;Biological system modeling;Buildings;Libraries;Metamodeling;System-on-chip","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","Metasynthesis;automotive SoC design;metamodeling technique;system synthesis tool","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, during the early stage of a development cycle, designers have more flexibility to improve the design quality. However, there are several fundamental challenges at early-stage when design database is NOT complete, including extraction, modeling and optimization. This paper tackles these fundamental issues of early-stage power grid design. The proposed methods have been silicon-validated on 32nm on-market chips and successfully applied to a 22nm design for its early stage power grid design. The findings from such practices reveal that, for sub-32nm chips, intrinsic on-die capacitance and power gate scheme may have more significant impact than expected on power integrity, and need to be well addressed at early stage.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881406","","Couplings;Logic gates;Metals;Optimization;Power grids;Rails;Wires","design engineering;optimisation;power grids","design quality improvement;development cycle;early-stage power grid design;intrinsic on-die capacitance;on-market chips;post-layout stage;power gate scheme;power integrity","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, 3D IC is a good candidate to address the design issues in conventional analog/digital mixed-signal IC designs. In this work, we focus on modeling and analyzing the impacts of through silicon vias (TSVs) on mixed-signal ICs. Based on the analysis, a set of design methodologies for 3D mixed-signal ICs are proposed. The design methodologies are verified with a case study, in which a 12-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is re-designed by partitioning it into three stacked layers for 3D integration. The experimental results show that, compared to the traditional 2D counterpart, our 3D SAR ADC with optimized TSV placement can achieve significant area and power reduction, and performance improvement. Specifically, due to the isolation of substrate noise disturbance in our 3D design, the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) is improved from 68.74 dB to 74.12 dB.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881493","","Abstracts;Couplings;Performance evaluation;Resistance;Silicon;Substrates;Through-silicon vias","analogue-digital conversion;flip-flops;logic partitioning;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC;3D SAR ADC;3D integration technology;3D mixed signal integrated circuits;SAR ADC design case;SNDR;analog mixed-signal IC designs;analog-to-digital converter;digital mixed-signal IC designs;heterogeneous integration;optimized TSV placement;power reduction;signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio;storage capacity 12 bit;substrate noise disturbance;successive approximation register;through silicon vias","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, it introduces the need for new cross-layered design methods (beyond hardware and software boundaries) to enhance the autonomy of WBSNs for ambulatory monitoring. In fact, by embedding more onboard intelligence and exploiting electrocardiogram (ECG) specific knowledge, it is possible to perform real-time compressive sensing, filtering, delineation and classification of heartbeats, while dramatically extending the battery lifetime of cardiac monitoring systems. The paper concludes by showing the results of this new approach to design ultra-low power wearable WBSNs in a real-life platform commercialized by SmartCardia.

In those designs, path delays depend exponentially on threshold voltage/temperature. As such, dynamic configurations at runtime are desired for best trade-off between operating power and performance. Unfortunately, most existing works only consider either process or temperature variations but not both, resulting in sub-optimal configurations or even functional failures. Moreover, little study has been performed on the graceful degradation of sub-threshold designs, which is important in the presence of drastic delay variations. Towards this, we present a novel critical path monitor based dynamic voltage scaling scheme. Considering both process and temperature variations, it minimizes the operating power under a given timing error probability (TEP) bound. An exact method to decide the optimal switching thresholds is also proposed. Experimental results on 45nm industrial designs show that with only 1% TEP, our scheme can reduce the operating power by up to 75.3% compared with the constant voltage scheme. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the very first work on dynamic configuration for graceful degradation in sub-threshold designs.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881425","","Degradation;Delays;Switches;Temperature measurement;Threshold voltage;Voltage control","critical path analysis;delays;error statistics;fault tolerance;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;power aware computing","TEP bound;critical path monitor;drastic delay variation;dynamic configuration;dynamic voltage scaling scheme;energy- constrained application;graceful degradation;industrial design;operating power reduction;optimal switching threshold;path delay;size 45 nm;subthreshold design;threshold temperature;threshold voltage;timing error probability","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we develop a holistic solution set, namely, state-restrict MLC STT-RAM (SR-MLC STT-RAM) to improve the data integrity and performance of MLC STT-RAM with the minimized information density degradation. Three techniques: state restriction (StatRes), error pattern removal (ErrPR), and ternary coding (TerCode) are proposed at circuit level to reduce the read and write errors of MLC STT-RAMcells. State pre-recovery (PreREC) technique is also developed at architecture level to improve the access performance of SR-MLC STT-RAM by eliminating unnecessary two-step write operations. Our simulations show that compared to conventional MLC STT-RAM, SR-MLC STT-RAM can enhance the write and read reliability of memory cells by 10 - 10000×, allowing the application of simple error correction code schemes. Compared to single-level-cell (SLC) STT-RAM, SR-MLC STT-RAM based cache design can boost the system performance by 6.2% on average by leveraging the increased cache capacity at the same area and the improved write latency.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881362","Multi-Level Cell;Performance;Reliability;STT-RAM","Computer architecture;Error analysis;Error correction codes;Microprocessors;Programming;Reliability;Resistance","MRAM devices;cache storage;circuit reliability;magnetoelectronics","cache design;high performance memory system;high reliable memory system;minimized information density;multilevel cell spin transfer torque random access memory;nonvolatile memory;state restrict MLC STT-RAM design","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we demonstrate how it can be used to analyze a real CAN bus with complex load patterns. We investigate the effects of these load patterns and show how the necessary parameters can be derived and verified from traces and specifications.

Motivated by the observation that for behavioral designs, especially control-flow intensive ones, variables have nonuniform soft error vulnerabilities, we propose a novel reliability-aware register binding technique to explore more effective soft error mitigation during high level synthesis. We first perform a comprehensive variable vulnerability analysis at the behavioral level, by considering error propagation and masking in both control and data flow. Then an optimization based on integer linear programming is used to incorporate vulnerabilities into the register binding phase with a selective register protection scheme. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique can achieve significant soft error mitigation (60% coverage of the total vulnerabilities) with a small portion (20%) of register protection.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881402","","Benchmark testing;Complexity theory;Equations;Optimization;Registers;Reliability engineering","VLSI;data flow graphs;high level synthesis;integer programming;integrated circuit reliability;linear programming;optimisation;radiation hardening (electronics)","control-flow intensive designs;data flow graph;design quality;error masking;error propagation;high level synthesis;integer linear programming;nanoscale VLSI;nonuniform soft error vulnerability;optimization;reliability-aware register binding phase technique;selective register protection scheme;soft error mitigation;variable vulnerability analysis","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A “good chips per wafer” metric is used to unify area, performance, variability and yield. The framework uses a generated virtual standard-cell library coupled with a mix of physical design, semi-empirical, and machine-learning-based models to estimate area and delay at the chip level. The result is a unified design-quality estimate that can be computed fast enough to allow using ChipDRE to optimize a large number of complex design rules. For instance, a study of well-to-active spacing rule reveals a non-monotone dependence of rule value to chip area (although the dependence to cell area is monotone) due to delay changes coming from well-proximity effect.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742867","","Computational modeling;Delays;Estimation;Layout;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Routing","electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit modelling;neural nets","ChipDRE;chip scale;chip-level design rule evaluator;complex design rules;die-level assessment;generated virtual standard-cell library;good chips per wafer metric;layout methodologies;machine-learning-based models;nonmonotone dependence;physical design models;rule value;semiempirical models;standard cell-level;systematic evaluation;unified design-quality estimate;well-proximity effect;well-to-active spacing rule","","2","","21","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we first develop an array-level model which includes the geometries and properties of all the components in the 3D structure. The model is capable of analyzing the read/write noise margin of a 3D-VRAM array in the presence of the sneak leakage current and voltage drop. Then we build a system-level design tool that is able to explore the design space with specified constraints and find the optimal design points with different targets. We also study the impact of different design parameters on the array size, bit density, and overall cost-per-bit.

In this paper, we consider two enhancements in packed stencil design over previous works. First, the use of multiple shaping apertures with different sizes is explored. Second, the fact that the pattern of a character can be located anywhere within its enclosing projection region is exploited to facilitate flexible blank space sharing. For this packed stencil design problem with multiple shaping apertures and flexible blank space sharing, a dynamic programming based algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed enhancement and the associated algorithm can significantly reduce the total shot count and hence improve the throughput of EBDW lithography.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742879","","Algorithm design and analysis;Apertures;Benchmark testing;Heuristic algorithms;Lithography;Memory management;Printing","dynamic programming;electron beam lithography","EBDW lithography;character pattern location;character projection method;chip production;dynamic programming algorithm;e-beam lithography;electron-beam direct write lithography;enclosing projection region;flexible blank space sharing;flexible packed stencil design;multiple-shaping apertures;packed stencil design problem;size 22 nm","","1","","12","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, the stochastic switching behaviors have been widely observed. To facilitate the investigation on memristor-based hardware implementation, we built a stochastic behavior model of TiO<sub>2</sub> memristive devices based on the real experimental results. By leveraging the stochastic behavior of memristors, a macro cell design composed of multiple parallel connecting memristors can be successfully used in implementing the weight storage unit and the stochastic neuron - the two fundamental components in neural network (NN)s, providing a feasible solution in memristor-based hardware implementation.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742993","","Artificial neural networks;Hardware;Memristors;Neurons;Resistance;Stochastic processes;Switches","memristors;neural nets;stochastic processes;titanium compounds","TiO<sub>2</sub>;arbitrary intermediate state;continuous resistance state;macro cell design;neural network;neuromorphic system design;parallel connecting memristors;stochastic behavior model;stochastic neuron;stochastic switching behaviors;synapse-like feature","","1","","22","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially the split of read and write paths in SOT-MRAM promises faster access times and lower energy consumption compared to STT-MRAM. In this work, we provide a very detailed analysis of SOT-MRAM at both circuit- and architecture-level. We present a detailed evaluation of performance and energy related parameters and compare the novel SOT-MRAM with several other memory technologies. Our architecture-level analysis shows that with a hybrid-combination of SRAM for the L1-cache and SOT-MRAM for the L2-cache the energy consumption can be reduced by 63 % in average while the performance can be increased by 1 %.

Driven by the principle of trading tolerable amounts of application accuracy in return for significant resource savings - the energy consumed, the (critical path) delay and the (silicon) area being the resources - this approach has been limited to certain application domains. In this paper, we propose to expand the application scope, error tolerance as well as the energy savings of inexact computing systems through neural network architectures. Such neural networks are fast emerging as popular candidate accelerators for future heterogeneous multi-core platforms, and have flexible error tolerance limits owing to their ability to be trained. Our results based on simulated 65nm technology designs demonstrate that the proposed inexact neural network accelerator could achieve 43.91%-62.49% savings in energy consumption (with corresponding delay and area savings being 18.79% and 31.44% respectively) when compared to existing baseline neural network implementation, at the cost of an accuracy loss (quantified as the Mean Square Error (MSE) which increases from 0.14 to 0.20 on average).","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742890","","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Biological neural networks;Hardware;Neurons;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;multiprocessing systems;neural nets","MSE;application accuracy;application scope;critical path delay;energy consumption;energy efficienct accelerators;energy savings;flexible error tolerance limits;future heterogeneous multicore platforms;inexact computing systems;machine-learning applications;mean square error;neural network architectures;resource savings;silicon area","","0","","25","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Camouflaged logic cells are integrated into a typical design flow using standard front end and back end models. Camouflaged logic cells obfuscate a circuit's function by introducing subtle cell design changes at the GDS level. The logic function of a camouflaged logic cell is extremely difficult to determine through silicon imaging analysis preventing netlist extraction, clones and counterfeits. The application of circuit camouflage as part of a customer's design flow can protect hardware IP from reverse engineering. Camouflage fill techniques further inhibit Trojan circuit insertion by completely filling the design with realistic circuitry that does not affect the primary design function. All unused silicon appears to be functional circuitry, so an attacker cannot find space to insert a Trojan circuit. The integration of circuit camouflage techniques is compatible with standard chip design flows and EDA tools, and ICs using such techniques have been successfully employed in high-attack commercial and government segments.

Most of the hardware Trojan detection techniques rely on a golden (trusted) IC against which to compare a suspected one. Hence they cannot be applied to designs using third party Intellectual Property (IP) cores where golden IP is unavailable. Moreover, due to the stealthy nature of hardware Trojan, there is no technique that can guarantee Trojan-free after manufacturing test. As a result, Trojan detection and recovery at run time acting as the last line of defense is necessary especially for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we propose design rules to assist run-time Trojan detection and fast recovery by exploring diversity of untrusted third party IP cores. With these design rules, we show the optimization approach to minimize the cost of implementation in terms of the number of different IP cores used by the implementation.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881484","Hardware Trojan;IP;design for security;detection and recovery;high-level synthesis;run time","Educational institutions;Hardware;IP networks;Integrated circuits;Payloads;Schedules;Trojan horses","hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;invasive software","design rules;golden IP;high level synthesis;integrated circuit development process;intellectual property cores;run time hardware Trojan detection","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is primarily aimed at reducing CPU time associated with generating and compressing test patterns. It prevents ATPG from assigning specified values to many inputs in order to cut down a time-consuming backtracking process needed to resolve conflicts leading to compression aborts.

The proposed approach, called SHiFA, is able to tolerate run-time faults at system level without any hardware overhead. In contrast to the existing system-level methods, network resources are also considered to be potentially faulty. Accordingly, applications are mapped onto healthy nodes of the system at run-time such that their interaction will not require the use of faulty elements.

Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) generate heat during their operation. This heat plus the heat generated in the circuit should be transferred to the ambient environment in order to avoid high die temperatures. This paper describes a hybrid cooling solution in which TECs are augmented with forced-convection coolers (fans). Precisely, an optimization framework called OFTEC is presented which finds the optimum TEC driving current and the fan speed to minimize the overall power consumption of the cooling system while maintaining safe die temperatures. Simulation results on a set of eight benchmarks show the benefits of the proposed approach. In particular, a baseline system without TECs but with a fan could meet the thermal constraint for only three of the benchmarks whereas the OFTEC solution satisfied thermal constraints for all benchmarks. In addition, OFTEC resulted in 5.4% less average power consumption for the aforesaid three benchmarks while lowering the maximum die temperature by an average of 3.7°C.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881513","Dynamic thermal management;cooling;forced-convection cooling;leakage power;low-power design;thermoelectric coolers","Benchmark testing;Cooling;Equations;Heating;Mathematical model;Optimization;Power demand","VLSI;circuit optimisation;fans;forced convection;low-power electronics;minimisation;power consumption;power control;thermal management (packaging);thermoelectric cooling","OFTEC;VLSI circuits;fans;forced convection control;forced convection cooler;heat generation;hybrid cooling solution;optimization;optimum TEC driving current;power aware deployment;power consumption minimization;spot cooling;thermal constraint satisfaction;thermoelectric cooler;thermoelectric cooling technology","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we take a fresh look at Online Arithmetic, originally proposed for digit serial operation, and synthesize unrolled digit parallel online operators to allow for graceful degradation. We quantify the impact of timing violation on key arithmetic primitives, and show that substantial performance benefits can be obtained in comparison to binary arithmetic. Since timing errors are caused by long carry chains, these result in errors in least significant digits with online arithmetic, causing less impact than conventional implementations. Using analytical models and empirical FPGA results from an image processing application, we demonstrate an error reduction over 89% and an improvement in SNR of over 20dB for the same clock rate.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881517","Imprecise Design;Online Arithmetic;Overclocking","Adders;Clocks;Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Probabilistic logic;Standards","clocks;field programmable gate arrays;timing circuits","FPGA;binary arithmetic;computer arithmetic;datapath synthesis;digit serial operation;digital circuits;image processing;key arithmetic primitives;latency-accuracy trade-offs;online arithmetic;overclocking;timing errors;timing violations;unrolled digit parallel online operators","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing monitoring techniques are, however, severely limited: for sensor-based techniques, monitoring accuracy is significantly compromised due to the mismatches in aging conditions between sensors and the target circuits, as well as random variation of aging effects; for in-situ techniques, measurement results are sensitive to environmental variations during test phases, also severely reducing monitoring accuracy. We propose a new technique that enables accurate in-situ aging monitoring even under large environmental variations by (i) scaling the supply voltage for temperature-insensitive delay and (ii) reconfiguring target paths into ring oscillators, whose oscillation periods are measured and compared to pre-aging measurement to estimate aging-induced delay degradations. With additional accuracy-improving strategies, the technique achieves highly-accurate monitoring with an error of 15.5% across the temperature variations in self-test phases from 0°C to 80°C, exhibiting >30× improvement in accuracy as compared to the conventional technique operating at nominal supply voltage.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881529","device aging;on-chip aging monitoring;reliability;self-test;temperature-insensitive design","Accuracy;Aging;Built-in self-test;Delays;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","ageing;automatic testing;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;oscillators;pipeline arithmetic","energy-efficiency;monitoring device aging effects;pipeline circuits;pre-aging measurement;reliability management techniques;ring oscillators;runtime monitoring;self-test phases;self-testing technique;temperature 0 C to 80 C;temperature-insensitive delay","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This assumption greatly simplifies the partitioning and balancing of an application's workload across threads; however, it no longer holds when the frequencies of the cores differ due to within-die variations, leading to a degradation in performance. We observe that, in addition to the frequency of the core that it executes on, the performance of a thread is also dependent on the share of shared system resources, such as last-level cache, that it receives. We propose variation-aware cache partitioning as an approach to redress the variation-induced imbalance in the execution times of threads, thereby improving the performance of multi-threaded programs. We discuss the challenges involved in realizing our proposal, including synchronization (e.g., barriers) across threads, which results in faster threads being limited by slower threads, the complex and non-linear relationship between a thread's performance and the cache capacity allocated to it, and the fact that different program phases, can respond quite differently to varying cache capacity. We propose a runtime scheme to perform spatio-temporal cache partitioning while considering both chip characteristics (frequency variations) and program characteristics. We evaluate the proposed technique by applying it to an ensemble of variation-impacted multi-cores executing multi-threaded programs from the PAR-SEC and SPEC-OMP suites, and demonstrate that it results in an average performance improvement of 15% by mitigating the impact of frequency variations.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881526","Multicores;Parallel Programs;Variation Aware Design;Variation Tolerance;Variations","Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Resource management;Runtime;Sensitivity;Synchronization","cache storage;microprocessor chips;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;resource allocation","PAR-SEC;SPEC-OMP;application workload balancing;application workload partitioning;cache capacity;homogeneous multicore processors;last-level cache;multithreaded programs;nonlinear relationship;program phases;shared system resources;spatio-temporal cache partitioning;variation aware cache partitioning;variation-induced imbalance;within-die variations","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a suite of solutions for combating die and IC recycling (CDIR). These solutions include light-weight, on-chip structures based on ring oscillators (RO-CDIR), anti-fuses (AF-CDIR) and fuses (F-CDIR). Each structure meets the unique needs and limitations of different part types and sizes providing excellent coverage of recycled parts. HSPICE simulation results using 90nm technology demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware RO-CDIR for detecting ICs used for very short period of time. Recycling of large digital ICs can effectively be detected by using AF-CDIR.

Hence, EDA algorithms at this level have to support exposing technology characteristics (such as process variations or aging) for consideration on higher levels of abstraction. Similarly, key parameters from system level, such as workload or executed processor instructions, have to be considered at lower levels for accurate analysis of, e.g., degradation effects. Circuit-level timing analysis plays a key role in this context as it provides key metrics such as achievable frequency, available timing margins and timing violation vulnerabilities of the analyzed circuit. We present an enhanced static timing analysis which links technology-level effects to system-level and vice versa.

Since the dynamic power is proportional to Vdd<sup>2</sup>, and the static power is proportional to Vdd, lowering power supply voltage is an efficient method to reduce the power usage. In this paper, we adopt the row-based dual-supply voltage (DSV) scheme. DSV assigns a low power supply voltage to timing noncritical gates for the power saving. Contrary to the traditional region-based voltage island works, the row-based approach creates voltage islands along the circuit rows. This kind of fine grid voltage islands give more flexibility on gate voltage assignment such that the low voltage gates can be selected primarily based on timing and design logic, which in turn minimizes the shifter insertion. We present a two-stage flow to generate voltage islands for every two mirrored circuit rows and place gates legally inside each island. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work to cover latch and LCB (local clock buffer) handling and shifter placement in voltage island generation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881452","clustering;dual supply voltage;placement","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Latches;Logic gates;Power demand;Timing","buffer circuits;clocks;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;nanoelectronics","LCB;circuit rows;fine grid voltage islands;gate voltage assignment;local clock buffer;nanometer chip design;power consumption;power saving;row based dual-supply voltage island generation;shifter insertion;shifter placement","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the first work that applies the cut process for decomposing odd cycles during routing. For SADP, further, overlay control is a critical issue for yield improvement; while published routers can handle only partial overlay scenarios, our work identifies all the scenarios that induce overlays and proposes a novel constraint graph to model all overlays. With the developed techniques, our router can achieve high-quality routing results with significantly fewer overlays (and thus better yields).

For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test the abilities of the FANCI prototype. In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups from multiple continents created designs with backdoors hidden in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are non-stealthy backdoors, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some areas where the FANCI prototype could be made more performant, which motivates further development of the prototype.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881502","backdoors;functional analysis;hardware;intellectual property;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Logic gates;Prototypes;Security;Testing;Wires","functional analysis;logic design","FANCI;blue team assessment;dynamic attack scenarios;frequent-action backdoors;functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification;functional analysis methods;hardware designs;malicious circuit identification;non-stealthy backdoors;red team assessment","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as the number of components grows, the total length of flow channels between components must increase exponentially. Recent empirical studies show that long flow channels are vulnerable due to blocking and leakage defects. Thus, it is desirable to minimize the total length of flow channels for robustness. Also, for timing-sensitive biochemical assays, increase in the longest length of flow channel will delay the assay completion time and lead to variation of fluid, thereby affecting the correctness of outcome. The increasing number of components, including the pre-placed components, on the chip makes the flow channel routing problem even more complicated. In this paper, we propose an efficient obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree algorithm to deal with flow channel routing problem in flow-based microfluidic biochips.

QED, an acronym for Quick Error Detection, is such a technique that effectively overcomes several post-silicon validation and debug challenges. QED systematically creates a wide variety of validation tests to quickly detect bugs, not only inside processor cores, but also inside uncore components (i.e., components in an SoC that are neither processor cores nor coprocessors) of multi-core SoCs.

How the LUTs are merged and the ALMs are packed has a significant impact on the quality of the placement. We propose a novel wirelength-driven algorithm to merge the LUTs and pack the ALMs to ensure that it will not adversely affect the final wire-length.

The most challenging task is how to accurately estimate the extremely small failure probability of memory circuits where the circuit failure is a “rare event”. Classic importance sampling has been widely recognized to be inaccurate and unreliable in high dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a fast statistical analysis to estimate the probability of rare events in high dimensions and prove that the estimation is always bounded. This methodology has been successfully applied to the failure analysis of memory circuits with hundreds of variables, which was considered to be very intractable before. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully solves high dimensional “rare event” problems without using expensive Monte Carlo and classic importance sampling methods. Experiments on a 54-dimensional SRAM cell circuit show that the proposed approach achieves 1150x speedup over Monte Carlo without compromising any accuracy. It also outperforms the classification based method (e.g., Statistical Blockade) by 204x and existing importance sampling method (e.g., Spherical Sampling) by 5x. On another 117-dimension circuit, the proposed approach yields 364x speedup over Monte Carlo while existing importance sampling methods completely fail to provide reasonable accuracy.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742928","","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation;Monte Carlo methods;Probability;Random access memory;Standards","Monte Carlo methods;SRAM chips;failure analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;probability;sampling methods;statistical analysis","54-dimensional SRAM cell circuit;IC designs;circuit failure analysis;classic importance sampling method;expensive Monte Carlo simulation;extremely small failure probability;fast statistical analysis;high dimensional rare event problems;high integration density;memory circuits;process variations;provably bounded failure analysis;rare event probability;reliability","","0","","14","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study an ECO routing problem where redundant vias are present in the given layout but can be considered for replacement or removal to increase the routability and improve the routing quality. To find an ECO routing path, we construct only the necessary part of the routing graph on-the-fly, and develop an A* search based algorithm for achieving efficient path finding. We also take redundant via replacement, removal, and insertion into account when formulating the routing cost, and apply a state-of-the-art method to perform redundant via replacement and insertion.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive interpolation-based model checking algorithm in which the degree of abstraction can be adjusted on demand. That is, during the proof process, we closely monitor the effectiveness of the interpolation-based over-approximated image computation and thus adjust the degree of abstraction for the best performance.

Due to the complexity of the DSA process, rigorous process simulation is unacceptably slow for full chip verification. This paper formulate several critical problems in DSA verification, and proposes a design automation methodology that consists of a data preparation and a model learning stage.

Formal verification (FV) has been successfully leveraged to achieve the high level of quality desired of these critical logics. Typically, FV-based approaches to verify FPUs rely on introducing higher level abstractions to allow reasoning. This however has to be done manually, and quickly becomes tedious for optimized bit level implementations on board high performance microprocessors. Automated formal methods working directly on the bit level and providing a full end-to-end check exist but are limited to single instructions (issued in an empty pipeline), hence lack in checking control aspects related to inter-instruction interactions, or pipeline control. In this paper we present an approach based on equivalence checking to overcome the single instruction limitation for automated bit level proofs in the formal verification of FPUs. The sequential execution of instructions is modeled by two instances of the design-under-test. One of the instances acts as a reference model for the other. This allows for large numbers of internal equivalences to be leveraged by equivalence checking techniques. We show that this method is capable of proving instruction sequences for industrial FPU designs. Together with a proof of correctness of individual instructions it guarantees correctness of the FPU design as a whole. In our experience this is a one of a kind approach to perform automated end-to-end verification of FPUs.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881478","","Abstracts;Pipelines;Servers;Vehicles","floating point arithmetic;formal verification;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","automated bit level proofs;automated end-to-end FPU verification;automated formal methods;automatic floating point unit verification;coverage driven simulation;critical logics;design-under-test;equivalence checking techniques;formal FPU verification;high performance microprocessors;industrial FPU designs;interinstruction interactions;pipeline control","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, conventional NoC designs may consume up to 30% of the entire chip's power budget, in large part due to leakage power. In this work, we address this issue by proposing Panthre: our solution deploys power-gating to provide long intervals of uninterrupted sleep to selected units. Packets that would normally use power-gated components are steered away via topology and routing reconfiguration, while Panthre provides low-latency alternate paths to their destinations. The routing reconfiguration operates in a distributed fashion and guarantees that deadlock-free routes are available at all times. At runtime, Panthre adapts to the application's communication patterns by updating its power-gating decisions. It employs a feedback-based distributed mechanism to control the amount of sleeping components and of packets detours, so that performance degradation is kept at a minimum. Our design is flexible, providing a mechanism that designers can use to tradeoff power savings with performance, based on application's requirements. Our experiments on multi-programmed communication-light workloads from the SPEC CPU2006 suite show that Panthre reduces total network power consumption by 14.5% on average, with only a 1.8% degradation in performance, when all processor nodes are active. At times when 15-25% of the processor cores are communication-idle, Panthre enables leakage power savings of 36.9% on average, while still providing connected and deadlock-free routes for all other nodes.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881489","network-on-chip;power-gating;routing-reconfiguration","Engines;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Routing;System recovery;Topology;Wires","circuit feedback;integrated circuit design;network routing;network topology;network-on-chip","SPEC CPU2006 suite;deadlock-free routing reconfiguration;fabric interconnect;feedback-based distributed mechanism;intrachip communication;multicore processor;multiprogrammed communication-light workload;networks-on-chip;power consumption;power-aware NoC;power-gated component;sleeping component;system-on-chip design;topology reconfiguration","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recycling of used chips constitutes a major form of counterfeiting attacks. If undetected, they can lead to serious consequences including system performance/reliability issues during field operation and potential revenue/reputation loss for a trusted manufacturer. Existing validation approaches based on path delay analysis suffer from reduced robustness and sensitivity under large process variations. On the other hand, existing design solutions based on aging sensors require additional design/verification efforts and cannot be applied to legacy chips. In this paper, we present a novel recycled chip identification approach, CACI, that exploits differential aging in self-similar modules (e.g., different parts of an adder) to isolate aged chips under large inter- and intra-die process variations. It compares dynamic current (I<sub>DDT</sub>) signatures between two adjacent similar circuit structures in a chip. We derive an isolation metric based on multiple current comparisons to provide high level of confidence. CACI does not rely on any embedded structures for authentication, thus it comes at virtually zero design overhead and can be applied to chips already in the market. Through extensive simulations, we show that for 15% inter- and 10% intra-die variations in threshold voltage for a 45nm CMOS process, over 97% of recycled chips can be reliably identified.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881415","BTI;Counterfeiting attack;Hardware security;Recycled chip","Accuracy;Adders;Aging;Integrated circuits;Semiconductor device measurement;Vectors","CMOS integrated circuits;ageing;integrated circuit design;recycling;security","CACI;CMOS;adder;aging sensors;differential aging;dynamic current analysis;inter-die process variations;intra-die process variations;path delay analysis;recycled chip identification;semiconductor industry;size 45 nm","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these and various other application domains, reduction is a frequently encountered operation, where multiple input elements need to be combined into a single element by an associative operation, e.g. addition or multiplication. There are many applications that require reduction such as: partial histogram merging, matrix multiplication and min/max-finding. Wide-SIMDs contain a large number of processing elements (PEs), which in general are connected by a minimal form of interconnect for scalability reasons. To efficiently support reduction operations on wide-SIMDs with such a minimal interconnect, we introduce two novel reduction algorithms which do not rely on complex communication networks or any dedicated hardware. The proposed approaches are compared with both dedicated hardware and other software solutions in terms of performance, area, and energy consumption. A practical case study demonstrates that the proposed software approach has much better generality, flexibility and no additional hardware cost. Compared to a dedicated hardware adder tree, the proposed software approach saves 6.8% area with a performance penalty of only 6.5%.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881435","","Abstracts;Layout;Radio frequency;Software;Vectors","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;logic design;low-power electronics;parallel processing","dedicated hardware;energy efficiency;minimal interconnection;reduction operator;single instruction multiple data architecture;software solutions;wide SIMD","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An MIG is a directed acyclic graph consisting of three-input majority nodes and regular/complemented edges. We show that MIGs include any AND/OR/Inverter Graphs (AOIGs), containing also the wellknown AIGs. In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881521","Boolean Algebra;DAG;Logic Synthesis;Majority Logic","Boolean functions;Data structures;Delays;Inverters;Optimization;Switches","Boolean functions;data structures;graph theory;logic design;logic gates","AND graph;Boolean function optimization;OR graph;data structure;directed acyclic graph;efficient logic optimization;logic synthesis;majority inverter graph","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a suite of solutions that enable aging simulation under all possible stress conditions. Key contributions include: (1) Compact modeling of BTI when the stress voltage is varying. The results to both reaction-diffusion (RD) and trapping/detrapping (TD) mechanisms are derived. (2) Efficient simulation under DVS, leveraging the new BTI models; (3) Silicon validation at 45nm and 65nm, at both device and circuit levels.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of Bayesian model fusion on Bernoulli distribution (BMF-BD) for efficient yield estimation at the late stage by borrowing the prior knowledge from an early stage. BMF-BD is particularly developed to handle the cases where the pre-silicon simulation and/or post-silicon measurement results are binary: either “pass” or “fail”. The key idea is to model the binary simulation/measurement outcome as a Bernoulli distribution and then encode the prior knowledge as a Beta distribution based on the theory of conjugate prior. As such, the late-stage yield can be accurately estimated through Bayesian inference with very few late-stage samples. Several circuit examples demonstrate that BMF-BD achieves up to 10× cost reduction over the conventional estimator without surrendering any accuracy.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881356","","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Integrated circuit modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation;Silicon;Yield estimation","elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;silicon","BMF-BD;Bayesian model fusion;Bernoulli distribution;Beta distribution;integrated circuits yield estimation;post-silicon validation;pre-silicon verification","","2","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed research is motivated by the observation that many of the in-field failures are delay failures and several variability signatures are also delay-related. The origins of temporal delay fluctuations include manufacturing variability, voltage/temperature changes, negative or positive bias temperature instability-related Vth degradation, etc. Since the actual delay changes depend on process variations as well as workload, on-chip monitoring may be the best way of predicting them. There is a need to monitor circuit performance during manufacturing as well as at runtime to predict achievable performance and warn against impending failures. Adaptive mechanisms in hardware and/or software can optimize the trade-off between errors, energy and performance based on the feedback from runtime circuit performance monitors. This paper presents approaches for automated synthesis of design-dependent performance monitors. These monitors can be used to predict impending delay failures relatively inexpensively. For low-overhead monitoring, we propose multiple design-dependent ring oscillators (DDROs) as smart canary structures which can reliably predict achievable chip frequency but with margins for local variations. Early silicon results indicate that DDROs can reduce delay monitoring error by 35% compared to conventional ring oscillators. To further improve the prediction (albeit at a higher overhead), we propose in-situ slack monitors (SlackProbe) which can match local variations as well at overheads much smaller than monitoring all sequential elements. SlackProbe reduces the number of monitors required by over 15X with 5% additional delay margin in several commercial processor benchmarks. Finally, we show an example of software testbed that demonstrates a variability-aware system that utilizes the- hardware monitors and operates with both hardware and software adaptation.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742935","","Delays;Hardware;Logic gates;Monitoring;Sensitivity;Software","fault tolerant computing;logic design;oscillators","DDRO;SlackProbe;adaptive mechanisms;bias temperature instability;circuit performance monitoring;delay failures;delay margin;design-dependent performance monitors;design-dependent ring oscillators;hardware adaptation;in-field failures;integrated systems;manufacturing variability;on-chip monitoring;processor benchmarks;runtime circuit performance monitors;smart canary structures;software adaptation;temporal delay fluctuations;usage life;variability signatures;variability-aware system;variability-aware systems;voltage-temperature changes","","0","","30","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vectorless power grid verification provides a promising approach to evaluate the worst-case voltage fluctuations without the detailed information of circuit activities. Vectorless verification is usually required to solve numerous linear programming problems to obtain the worst-case voltage fluctuation throughout the grid, which is extremely time-consuming for large-scale verification. In this paper, a maximum voltage drop location estimation approach is proposed for efficient vectorless verification. The power grid nodes are grouped into disjoint subsets, and an estimation strategy is utilized to roughly locate the nodes which have the worst-case voltage drop in each group. Consequently, the verification problem size can be significantly reduced compared with accurate verification.

The Boolean models produced by ABCD-NL can be used for high-speed simulation and formal verification of AMS designs, by leveraging existing tools developed for Boolean/hybrid systems analysis (e.g., ABC [1]).

The target network topology is a variant Mesh-of-Trees (MoT), combining a binary fan-out (i.e. routing) network and a binary fan-in (i.e. arbitration) network, which is becoming widely used for multi-core shared-memory interfaces. The two key features are: (i) each fan-in node can resolve its arbitration and pre-allocate the corresponding input channel, before the actual data arrives; and (ii) a lightweight shadow monitoring network fast forwards information as soon as data enters the network without synchronization to a fixed-rate clock, notifying each fan-in node on its path to enable the early arbitration. Simulations of the new arbitration node, using IBM 90nm technology and an ARM standard cell library, indicate latency reductions up to 54.4% over prior designs, while maintaining roughly comparable throughput. Network-level simulations were then performed on eight diverse synthetic benchmarks, comparing the new approach (""early arbitration"") with two earlier alternative asynchronous MoT networks (""baseline"" and ""predictive""), using a mix of random and deterministic traffic. Considerable improvements in system latency were obtained on all benchmarks, ranging from 13.0% to 38.7%, with especially strong benefits for the two most adversarial benchmarks.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742911","","Latches;Monitoring;Network topology;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Topology","asynchronous circuits;logic design;shared memory systems;synchronisation","ARM standard cell library;IBM;MoT;arbitration resolution;asynchronous arbitration node;asynchronous interconnection network;binary fan-in network;binary fan-out network;mesh-of-trees;multicore shared-memory interfaces;shadow monitoring network;size 90 nm;target network topology","","0","","31","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this general context, lossless data compression is a beneficial technique that encodes information using fewer (or at most equal number of) bits as compared to the original representation. A traditional compression flow consists of two phases: data decorrelation and entropy encoding. Data decorrelation, also called entropy reduction, aims at reducing the autocorrelation of the input data stream to be compressed in order to enhance the efficiency of entropy encoding. Entropy encoding reduces the size of the previously decorrelated data by using techniques such as Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, and others. When the data decorrelation is optimal, entropy encoding produces the strongest lossless compression possible. While efficient solutions for entropy encoding exist, data decorrelation is still a challenging problem limiting ultimate lossless compression opportunities. In this paper, we use logic synthesis to remove redundancy in binary data aiming to unlock the full potential of lossless compression. Embedded in a complete lossless compression flow, our logic synthesis based methodology is capable to identify the underlying function correlating a data set. Experimental results on data sets deriving from different causal processes show that the proposed approach achieves the highest compression ratio compared to state-of-art compression tools such as ZIP, bzip2 and 7zip.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742961","","Data compression;Decorrelation;Encoding;Entropy;Indexes;Logic circuits;Transforms","data compression;entropy codes;logic design","7zip;Huffman coding;ZIP;arithmetic coding;bzip2;compression flow;data decorrelation;data resource usage reduction;decorrelated data size reduction;entropy encoding;entropy reduction;information encoding;input data stream autocorrelation reduction;logic synthesis;lossless compression flow;lossless compression opportunity;lossless data compression;software-hardware applications","","0","","20","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have also quantified the dependencies of aging effects on switching-activity and power-state of workloads. Implementation results show that the processor timing degradation can vary from 2% to 11%, depending on the workload. Due to the dependence of aging on the application workloads, margin based design will be highly pessimistic. We propose an efficient and flexible in situ monitoring methodology, SlackProbe, which inserts timing monitors at both path endpoints and path intermediate nets. We show that SlackProbe reduces the numbers of monitors required by over 15X with ~5% additional delay margin in several commercial processor benchmarks.

However, this trend significantly reduces the reliability and endurance of flash memory chips. The lifetime degradation worsens as the number of erase cycles grows, even with wear leveling technology being adopted to extend flash memory lifetime by evenly distributing erase cycles to every flash block. To address this issue, self-healing technology is proposed to recover a flash block before the flash block is worn out, but such a technology still has its limitation when recovering flash blocks. In contrast to the existing wear leveling designs, we adopt the self-healing technology to propose a heal-leveling design that evenly distributes healing cycles to flash blocks. Ultimately, heal-leveling aims to extend the lifetime of flash memory without introducing a large amount of live-data copying overheads. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the capability of the proposed design. The results show that our design can significantly improve the access performance and the effective lifetime of flash memory without the unnecessary overheads caused by wear leveling technology.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881410","endurance;flash memory;reliability;self-healing;wear leveling","Ash;Heating;Process control;Reliability;Safety;Servers;Thigh","fault tolerant computing;flash memories;performance evaluation","access performance improvement;flash block recovery;flash memory chip endurance;flash memory chip reliability;flash memory density;flash memory lifetime degradation;heal-leveling design;live-data copying overheads;self-healing technology;storage capacity;trading wear-leveling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, different techniques to increase reliability like hardware-/software-based redundancy or component hardening are applied systematically during Design Space Exploration (DSE), aiming at achieving highest reliability at lowest possible cost. Existing approaches typically solely provide reliability measures, e. g. failure rate or Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF), to the optimization engine, poorly guiding the search which parts of the implementation to change. As a remedy, this work proposes an efficient approach that (a) determines the importance of resources with respect to the system's reliability and (b) employs this knowledge as part of a local search to guide the optimization engine which components/design decisions to investigate. First, we propose a novel approach to derive Importance Measures (IMs) using a structural evaluation of Success Trees (STs). Since ST-based reliability analysis is already used for MTTF calculation, our approach comes at almost no overhead. Second, we enrich the global DSE with a local search. Here, we propose strategies guided by the IMs that directly change and enhance the implemen- tation. In our experimental setup, the available measures to enhance reliability are the selection of hardening levels during resource allocation and software-based redundancy during task binding; exemplarily, the proposed local search considers the selected hardening levels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach regarding optimization quality, particularly in the search for highly-reliable yet affordable implementations - at negligible runtime overhead.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881342","","Embedded systems;Logic gates;Optimization;Redundancy;Reliability engineering;Resource management","redundancy;reliability;resource allocation;software reliability","DSE;ST-based reliability analysis;component hardening;design space exploration;embedded systems;hardware-based redundancy;local search;multiobjective local-search optimization;negligible runtime overhead;optimization engine;reliability importance measurement;resource allocation;software-based redundancy;success trees;system reliability","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea is that if the control flow - or the sequence of instructions that are executed - is correct, then most probably the execution of the program is correct. Although researchers claim the effectiveness of the proposed CFC techniques, we argue that their evaluation has been inadequate and can even be wrong! Recently, the metric of vulnerability has been proposed to quantify the susceptibility of computation to soft errors. Laced with this comprehensive metric, we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of several existing CFC schemes, and obtain surprising results. Our results show that existing CFC techniques are not only ineffective in protecting computation from soft errors, but that they incur additional power and performance overheads. Software-only CFC protection schemes (CFCSS [14], CFCSS+NA [2], and CEDA [18]) increase system vulnerability by 18% to 21% with 17% to 38% performance overhead; Hybrid CFC protection technique, CFEDC [4] also increases the vulnerability by 5%; While the vulnerability remains almost the same for hardware only CFC protection technique, CFCET [15], they cause overheads of design cost, area, and power due to the hardware modifications required for their implementations.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881340","","Assembly;Measurement;Pipelines;Program processors;Registers;Runtime","program testing;program verification;radiation hardening (electronics)","CEDA;CFC based techniques;CFCET;CFCSS;CFCSS+NA;CFEDC;area overhead;comprehensive metric;control flow checking mechanisms;control flow checking-based techniques;design cost overhead;hardware-only CFC protection technique;hybrid CFC protection technique;instruction sequence;performance overhead;power overhead;program execution;quantitative analysis;quantitative evaluation;soft error computation susceptibility quantification;software-only CFC protection schemes;vulnerability metric","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Tile before multiplication: An efficient strategy to optimize DSP multiplier for accelerating prime field ECC for NIST curves","Roy, D.B.; Mukhopadhyay, D.; Izumi, M.; Takahashi, J.","Indian Inst. of Technol., Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20140821","2014","","","1","6","High speed DSP blocks present in the modern FPGAs can be used to implement prime field multiplication to accelerate Elliptic Curve scalar multiplication in prime fields. However, compared to logic slices, DSP blocks are scarce resources, hence its usage needs to be optimized. The asymmetric 25 × 18 signed multipliers in FPGAs open a new paradigm for multiplier design, where operand decomposition becomes equivalent to a tiling problem. Previous literature has reported that for asymmetric multiplier, it is possible to generate a tiling (known as non-standard tiling) which requires less number of DSP blocks compared to standard tiling, generated by school book algorithm. In this paper, we propose a generic technique for such tiling generation and generate this tiling for field multiplication in NIST specified curves. We compare our technique with standard school book algorithm to highlight the improvement. The acceleration in ECC scalar multiplication due to the optimized field multiplier is experimentally validated for P-256. The impact of this accelerated scalar multiplication is shown for the key encapsulation algorithm PSEC-KEM (Provably Secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism).","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881504","DSP Blocks;ECC;FPGA;NIST Curves","Clocks;Digital signal processing;Educational institutions;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Field programmable gate arrays;Standards","digital signal processing chips;encapsulation;field programmable gate arrays;multiplying circuits;public key cryptography","DSP multiplier;ECC scalar multiplication;FPGA;NIST curves;P-256;asymmetric multiplier;elliptic curve scalar multiplication;key encapsulation algorithm PSEC-KEM;multiplier design;operand decomposition;prime field multiplication;provably secure key encapsulation mechanism;school book algorithm;tiling generation;tiling problem","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Energy-efficiency techniques employ voltage overscaling that increases timing sensitivity to variations and hence aggravating the energy use issues. This paper proposes a method to increase spatiotemporal reuse of computational effort by a combination of compilation and micro-architectural design. An associative memristive memory (AMM) module is integrated with the floating point units (FPUs). Together, we enable fine-grained partitioning of values and find high-frequency sets of values for the FPUs by searching the space of possible inputs, with the help of application-specific profile feedback. For every kernel execution, the compiler pre-stores these high-frequent sets of values in AMM modules - representing partial functionality of the associated FPU- that are concurrently evaluated over two clock cycles. Our simulation results show high hit rates with 32-entry AMM modules that enable 36% reduction in average energy use by the kernel codes. Compared to voltage overscaling, this technique enhances robustness against timing errors with 39% average energy saving.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881522","Energy efficiency;GPGPUs;compiler;memory-based computing;memristor;timing errors;variations","Clocks;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Kernel;Memristors;Pipelines;Timing","energy conservation;graphics processing units;power aware computing;program compilers","AMM module;FPU;application-specific profile feedback;associative memristive memory module;collaborative compilation;energy saving;energy use;energy-efficiency techniques;energy-efficient GPGPU architecture;floating point units;general purpose graphics processing unit;kernel execution;memristive memory-based computing;microarchitectural design;spatiotemporal reuse;timing sensitivity;voltage overscaling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security design errors may therefore go undetected until the side-channel leakage is physically measured and evaluated. We show a better solution based on static analysis of C source code. We introduce the new notion of Quantitative Masking Strength (QMS) to estimate the amount of information leakage from software through side channels. The QMS can be automatically computed from the source code of a countermeasure implementation. Our experiments, based on side-channel measurement on real devices, show that the QMS accurately quantifies the side-channel resistance of the software implementation.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881536","SMT solver;Side channel attack;countermeasure;differential power analysis;quantitative masking strength","Benchmark testing;Cryptography;Random variables;Resistance;Software;Software measurement","object-oriented methods;program diagnostics;security of data","C source code;QMS;counter-measure implementation;information leakage;masked software;power analysis based side-channel attacks;quantitative masking strength;security design;side-channel resistance;static analysis","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware and software solutions have been deployed to accomplish MBPTA requirements. The latter has achieved the i.i.d. properties running on some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processor designs. Unfortunately, software randomisation challenges functional verification needed for certification since it introduces indirections through pointers in the code.

We found that over the four characterized generations, the average power consumption of the smartphones with a connected Wi-Fi network on the selected Apps increases about 38.20%, indicating more and more energy-hungry designs. However, the raising of the power consumption is not mainly from the radio modules as the power efficiency of the Wi-Fi module indeed improves by about 21%.

However, restricting the design space of steep slope technology-based processors to near-threshold or sub-threshold general purpose processors does the technology a disservice. Steep slope (SS) architectures can simultaneously expand the frontiers of viable computers at both ends of the energy scale: On the one hand, SS architectures enable ultra-low power sensor nodes and wearable technology, while on the other, they are applicable to high powered servers and high performance computing engines.

Once a counter-example is returned by a formal tool, the user typically does not know if the failure is caused by a design bug, an incorrectly written assertion, or a missing assumption. Previous work in debug automation has focused on the former two cases. This paper introduces a novel methodology to automatically debug missing assumptions. It begins by generating multiple formal counter-examples for the error. Next, a function is extracted from these counter-examples that encodes the input combinations that cause the assertion to fail. This function is later used to generate a list of fixed cycle assumptions that prevent failures similar to the generated counter-examples. These filtered assumptions can then be used as hints for the actual missing assumption. Further, if a missing assumption is not the cause of the failure, the method offers the additional benefit that the counter-examples it generates can be utilized to debug the RTL and/or the assertion. An extensive set of experimental results on OpenCores designs and assertions show that the number of generated assumptions can be reduced by an average of 38% using ten counter-examples, while an average of 28 assumptions is returned to the user.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742977","","Computer bugs;Context;Debugging;Equations;Mathematical model;Pins;Vectors","computer debugging;formal verification","OpenCores designs;RTL debugging;assertion debugging;automated missing assumption debugging;corner case design bug detection;debug automation;failure detection;fixed cycle assumptions;formal verification;function extraction;multiple formal counter-example generation","","0","","19","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the ever-increasing variabilities cause large uncertainty on delay and power. Such statistical nature in performance parameters easily makes deterministic energy optimization hard to achieve desirable performance yield, defined as the probability of the design meeting timing constraints of the system. In this paper, we propose a variation-aware statistical energy optimization framework, which takes account of performance yield constraints in energy-aware task scheduling, voltage assignment and VFI partitioning process. Energy optimization sensitivity, defined as energy variations of the task under voltage scaling, combines with the statistical slack of the task to guide the overall optimization flow.

The ability to execute code in parallel gives MPSoCs the potential to achieve high performance with low power consumption. In order for sequential legacy code to take advantage of the MPSoC design paradigm, it must first be partitioned into data flow graphs (such as Kahn Process Networks - KPNs) to ensure the data elements can be correctly passed between the separate processing elements that operate on them. Existing techniques are inadequate for use in complex legacy code. This paper proposes SDG2KPN, a System Dependency Graph to KPN conversion methodology targeting the conversion of legacy code. By creating KPNs at the granularity of the function-/procedure-level, SDG2KPN is the first of its kind to support shared and global variables as well as many more program patterns/application types. We also provide a design flow which allows the creation of MPSoC systems utilizing the produced KPNs. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by retargeting several sequential applications to the Tensilica MPSoC framework. Our system parallelized AES, an application of 950 lines, in 4.8 seconds, while H.264, of 57896 lines, took 164.9 seconds to parallelize.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742901","","Australia;Generators;Input variables;Manuals;Parallel processing;Program processors;Syntactics","data flow graphs;low-power electronics;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;system-on-chip","H.264;Kahn process networks;MPSoC design paradigm;SDG2KPN;Tensilica MPSoC framework;data flow graphs;embedded devices;function-level KPN generation;function-procedure-level;low power consumption;multiprocessor system-on-chip paradigm;parallel processing;sequential legacy code;system dependency graph to KPN conversion methodology;time 164.9 s;time 4.8 s","","0","","20","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an automatic synthesis approach for quantum circuits that implement Clifford Group operations. These circuits are essential for many quantum applications and cover core aspects of quantum functionality. The proposed approach exploits specific properties of the unitary transformation matrices that are associated to quantum operations.

As a result, we have few cells overlapping with fixed blocks after global placement, implying that the global placement solution resembles a legal solution more and that legalization has less perturbance to the placement quality. Also, in the final placement result, fewer cells are around macro blocks, whose negative effect in the future routing stage can thus be reduced. Routing solutions obtained by a commercial router show that for most benchmark circuits, detailed routing solutions with fewer violations can be achieved on the placement results generated by our analytical placer.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742864","","Benchmark testing;Measurement;Pins;Resource management;Routing;Runtime;Smoothing methods","network routing;network synthesis","benchmark circuits;design rules;detailed-routability;distributing cells;fixed macroblocks;global placement solution;mixed-size circuit analytical placement;pin congestion;pin density constraints;scaled smoothing method","","0","","23","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For architectures with state-based events or scheduling, such as load-dependent frequency scaling, model checking has emerged as a promising tool. It formally verifies timing behavior of realtime systems with minimal over-approximation of the worst case delays. In this context, Event Count Automata (ECAs) have become a valuable modeling approach because they are specifically designed to handle typical arrival patterns and integrate well with analytic techniques. In this work, we propose an extension of the ECA framework's semantics and use it in a Fixed-Priority Non-preemptive Scheduling (FPNS) model that correctly abstracts the intra-slot behavior in the slotted-time model of the ECA. This is challenging because straightforward implementations cannot capture the full behavior of event-triggered scheduling with such a time model that the ECA shares with most model checking based methods. In a case study, we obtain bounds via model checking a basic model and then our proposed model. We compare these bounds with a SystemC simulation. This shows that the bounds from the basic model are too optimistic - and exceeded in practice - because it does not capture the full behavior, while the bounds from the proposed extended model are both safe and reasonably tight.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742990","","Analytical models;Automata;Delays;Model checking;Semantics;Sensors","automata theory;formal verification;scheduling","ECA framework semantics;FPNS model;SystemC simulation;automata-theoretic modeling;design process;event count automata;event-triggered scheduling;fixed-priority nonpreemptive scheduling;formal analysis methods;formal timing verification;intra-slot behavior;load-dependent frequency scaling;minimal over-approximation;model checking based methods;safety-critical systems;slotted-time model;state-based events;valuable modeling approach;worst case delays","","0","","15","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea of No? is to store a data packet in the Network-on-Chip as a common base value plus an array of relative differences (?). It can improve the overall network performance and achieve energy savings because of the decreased network load. Moreover, this scheme does not require modifications of the cache storage design and can be seamlessly integrated with any optimization techniques for the on-chip interconnect.

Memories are susceptible to degradation and failures from a wide range of manufacturing, operational and environmental effects, requiring a multi-layer hardware/software approach that can tolerate, adapt and even opportunistically exploit such effects. The overall memory hierarchy is also highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of variability and operational stress. After reviewing the major memory degradation and failure modes, this paper describes the challenges for dependability across the memory hierarchy, and outlines research efforts to achieve multi-layer memory resilience using a hardware/software approach. Two specific exemplars are used to illustrate multi-layer memory resilience: first we describe static and dynamic policies to achieve energy savings in caches using aggressive voltage scaling combined with disabling faulty blocks; and second we show how software characteristics can be exposed to the architecture in order to mitigate the aging of large register files in GPGPUs. These approaches can further benefit from semantic retention of application intent to enhance memory dependability across multiple abstraction levels, including applications, compilers, run-time systems, and hardware platforms.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2596684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881375","","Circuit faults;Hardware;Memory management;Random access memory;Reliability;Resilience;Software","cache storage;energy conservation;graphics processing units;hardware-software codesign;power aware computing","GPGPU;abstraction levels;cache;dynamic policy;energy savings;failure modes;faulty blocks;high-performance memory bandwidth;memory degradation;memory dependability;memory hierarchy;multilayer hardware-software approach;multilayer memory resiliency;operational stress;software characteristics;static policy;variability stress;voltage scaling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is a mature technology for printing 1D layouts. However, for 20nm and beyond, SADP using a single trim mask becomes insufficient for printing all 1D layouts. A viable solution is to complement SADP with e-beam lithography. In this paper, in order to increase the throughput of printing a 1D layout, we consider the problem of e-beam shot count minimization subject to bounded line end extension constraints. Two different approaches of utilizing the trim mask and e-beam to print a layout are considered. The first approach is under the assumption that the trim mask and e-beam are used for end cutting. The second is under the assumption that the trim mask and e-beam are used to rid of all unnecessary portions. We propose elegant ILP formulations for both approaches. Experimental results show that both ILP formulations can be solved efficiently. The pros and cons of the two approaches for manufacturing 1D layout are discussed.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881378","SADP;e-beam;end cutting;gap removal","Benchmark testing;Layout;Lithography;Metals;Printing;Wires","electron beam lithography;integer programming;linear programming;nanolithography;nanopatterning","1D layout;ILP formulations;SADP;e-beam based manufacturing;e-beam lithography;self-aligned double patterning;single trim mask;throughput optimization;wavelength 20 nm","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They can be handled through fault tolerance techniques like scrubbing and modular redundancy. However, selecting these techniques statically at design or compile time tends to be pessimistic and prohibits optimal adaptation to changing soft error rate at runtime. We present the GUARD method which allows for autonomous runtime reliability management in reconfigurable architectures: Based on the error rate observed during runtime, the runtime system dynamically determines whether a computation should be executed by a hardened processor, or whether it should be accelerated by inherently less reliable reconfigurable hardware which can trade-off performance and reliability. GUARD is the first runtime system for reconfigurable architectures that guarantees a target reliability while optimizing the performance. This allows applications to dynamically chose the desired degree of reliability. Compared to related work with statically optimized fault tolerance techniques, GUARD provides up to 68.3% higher performance at the same target reliability.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881359","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Containers;Error analysis;Hardware;Reliability;Runtime","SRAM chips;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;optimisation;radiation hardening (electronics);reconfigurable architectures","GUARD method;SRAM-based FPGA;autonomous runtime reliability management;fault tolerance techniques;guaranteed reliability;hardened processor;modular redundancy;reconfigurable architectures;reconfigurable systems;runtime system;soft error rate at runtime","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing solutions either suffer from performance overhead or only enforce coarse-grain CFI policies that a sophisticated adversary can undermine. In this paper, we tackle these limitations and present the design of novel security hardware mechanisms to enable fine-grained CFI checks. Our CFI proposal is based on a state model and a per-function CFI label approach. In particular, our CFI policies ensure that function returns can only transfer control to active call sides (i.e, return landing pads of functions currently executing). Further, we restrict indirect calls to target the beginning of a function, and lastly, deploy behavioral heuristics for indirect jumps.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881460","","Embedded systems;Hardware;Payloads;Radiation detectors;Runtime;Security","embedded systems;security of data","CFI;CFI label approach;CFI policy;ROP attacks;behavioral heuristics;code injection attacks;embedded system protection;hardware-assisted fine-grained control-flow integrity;runtime attacks;security hardware mechanisms;software exploitation","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing solutions exploit coding techniques with considerably high overhead to protect configuration frames against multiple bit upsets. In this paper, we propose a generic scrubbing scheme which reconstructs the erroneous configuration frame based on the concept of erasure codes. Our proposed scheme does not require any changes to the FPGA architecture.

Also memory partitioning is explored to increase the memory bandwidth by scheduling multiple simultaneous memory accesses to different memory banks. Prior work on memory partitioning of data reuse buffers is limited to uniform partitioning. In this paper, we perform an early-stage exploration of non-uniform memory partitioning. We use the stencil computation, a popular communication-intensive application domain, as a case study to show the potential benefits of non-uniform memory partitioning. Our novel method can always achieve the minimum memory size and the minimum number of memory banks, which cannot be guaranteed in any prior work.

Also, the randomness obtained from the sequential PUFs is significantly higher compared to the existing PUFs.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881417","","Delays;Emulation;Equations;Integrated circuits;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Reverse engineering","cryptography;reverse engineering","GLC;PUF reverse engineering approach;gate-level characterization;gate-level delay properties;physical unclonable functions;prevention techniques;sequential PUF architecture;side channels","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scaling to sub-20nm technology nodes changes the nature of reliability effects from abrupt functional problems to progressive degradation of the performance characteristics of devices and system components. The impact of unreliability results in time-dependent variability, directly translating into design uncertainty in manufactured chips. Further, application workloads can significantly affect the overall system reliability. In this work, we have analyzed aging effects on various design hierarchies of an embedded processor in 28nm running real-world applications. We have also quantified the dependencies of aging effects on switching-activity and power-state of workloads. Implementation results show that the processor timing degradation can vary from 2% to 11%, depending on the workload.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742936","","Aging;Degradation;Integrated circuit reliability;Libraries;Program processors;Timing","CMOS digital integrated circuits;ageing;embedded systems;integrated circuit reliability","aging effects;continued CMOS scaling;device performance characteristics;embedded processors;manufactured chips;overall system reliability;physical limit;processor timing degradation;reliability effects;reliability limit;running real-world application;size 20 nm;switching-activity;system component performance characteristics;technology nodes;time-dependent variability;workload dependent reliability quantification","","0","","18","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the small bandwidth of the trace buffer, only a few state elements can be selected or tracing in order to restore the states of the remaining state elements as many as possible. In this work, we show that the quality of restoration corresponding to a set of trace signals selected for a single operating mode, may significantly degrade over the remaining operating modes of a design; an operating mode refers to specific values taken by control signals such as signals for mode selection and scan enable. This is the first work to study the multi-mode trace signal selection problem in order to maximize the restoration over all the operating modes of a design. We propose algorithmic strategies for this problem as well as a procedure to reduce the number of modes by merging the ones with “similar” restoration maps; merging improves the runtime scalability of our multi-mode trace selection algorithm with increase in the number of modes, without much loss in the solution quality.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742963","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742963","","Benchmark testing;Equations;Mathematical model;Measurement;Merging;Rats;Runtime","computer debugging;elemental semiconductors;signal processing;silicon","Si;algorithmic strategies;control signals;internal signals;mode selection;multimode trace signal selection;online tracing;post-silicon debug;restoration maps;scan enable;single operating mode;state elements;trace buffers","","0","","17","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an automatic synthesis environment, fast SNR computation is of paramount importance. So far the main SNR computation method has been behavioral simulation. Other less accurate methods are based on empirical formulas. These methods could not contribute too much to the enhancement of synthesis efficiency. In this work a highly efficient and purely symbolic SNR computation method is proposed. The difficulty in the computation of noise power (requiring integration of a rational function) is overcome by Taylor polynomial approximation. Together with a symbolic loop-transfer analysis tool, the SNR can be computed fully symbolically. This novel computation method is applied to variational SC-SDM analysis.

By this effect, a SPAD translates an incoming photon to a macroscopic current pulse. These devices are currently used for building medical devices characterized by a very high time resolution. An appealing application of SPAD is to use them as a basic block for building the entropy source of true random number generators. In this paper we focus on such application, and we explore the design challenges behind the realization of a quantum random number generator based on a massively parallel array of SPADs. The matrix under investigation comprises 512×128 independent cells that convert photons onto a raw bit-stream, which, as ensured by the properties of quantum physics, is characterized by a very high level of randomness. The sequences are read out in a 128-bit parallel bus, concatenated, and pipelined onto a de-biasing filter. Subsequently, we fabricated the proposed chip using a standard CMOS process. Our results, achieved on the manufactured device and coupling two matrices, show that our architecture can reach up to 5 Gbit/s while consuming 25pJ/bit, thus demonstrating scalability and performance for any random number generators based on SPADs.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742986","","Arrays;CMOS integrated circuits;Generators;Light emitting diodes;Photonics;Standards;Throughput","CMOS integrated circuits;avalanche photodiodes;electric breakdown;photodetectors;random number generation","128-bit parallel bus;SPAD;avalanche effect;breakdown voltage;debiasing filter;entropy source;macroscopic current pulse;massively parallel array;p-n junction breakdown;quantum physics;quantum random number generator;raw bitstream;single-photon avalanche diodes;solid-state photodetectors;standard CMOS process;storage capacity 128 bit;true random number generators","","0","","13","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First the symbolic transient modified nodal analysis (MNA) formulation of the circuit matrices of (linearized) analog and interconnect circuits at a time step is formed. Then the closed-form expressions of the interested performance in terms of variational parameters of the circuit matrices of (linearized) analog and interconnect circuits are derived via a graph-based symbolic analysis method. Then time-domain performance response bound of current time step are obtained by a nonlinear constrained optimization process subject to the parameter variations and variational circuit state bounds computed from the previous time step. We study the bounds computed by the proposed against the different sigma bounds by the standard MC method, which shows that the proposed method is more efficient for computing high sigma bounds than the MC method. Experimental results show that the new method can deliver order of magnitudes speedup over the standard Monte Carlo simulation on some typical analog circuits and interconnect circuits with high accuracy.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742933","","Analog circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Monte Carlo methods;Optimization;Standards;Time-domain analysis;Upper bound","analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit interconnections;nonlinear programming;time-domain analysis","MNA;analog integrated circuits;circuit matrices;graph-based symbolic analysis method;interconnect circuits;nonMonte Carlo performance bound analysis;nonlinear constrained optimization process;process variations;symbolic transient modified nodal analysis;time-domain performance bound analysis;time-domain performance response bound","","0","","24","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The memristor-based neural network further demonstrates a power efficient hardware realization of ANN. Training phase is the critical operation of memristor-based neural network. However, the traditional training method for memristor-based neural network is time consuming and energy inefficient. Users have to first work out the parameters of memristors through digital computing systems and then tune the memristor to the corresponding state. In this work, we introduce a mixed-signal training acceleration framework, which realizes the self-training of memristor-based neural network. We first modify the original stochastic gradient descent algorithm by approximating calculations and designing an alternative computing method. We then propose a mixed-signal acceleration architecture for the modified training algorithm by equipping the original memristor-based neural network architecture with the copy crossbar technique, weight update units, sign calculation units and other assistant units. The experiment on the MNIST database demonstrates that the proposed mixed-signal acceleration is 3 orders of magnitude faster and 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than the CPU implementation counterpart at the cost of a slight decrease of the recognition accuracy (<; 5%).","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742916","Memristor;Neural Network;Training","Acceleration;Arrays;Convergence;Memristors;Mirrors;Neural networks;Training","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);memristors;neural nets;stochastic processes","artificial neural network;digital computing systems;memristor-based neural network;mixed-signal training acceleration;power efficient hardware realization;stochastic gradient descent algorithm;training phase","","4","","18","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NBTI-induced performance degradation depends heavily on time-varying parameters such as temperature, duty cycle and supply voltage. Previous analytical models for NBTI effects, however, cannot cover all these parameters, causing overly optimistic or overly pessimistic analysis. In this work, we propose a comprehensive NBTI analytical model that explicitly takes supply voltage, duty cycle and temperature variations into consideration.

The preliminary concern for PCM applicability is its limited write endurance that is highly affected by process variation in nanometer regime. This increases the variation in cell lifetime resulting in early and sudden reduction in main memory capacity due to wear-out of few cells. When some memory pages reach their endurance limits, other pages may be far from their limits even when using a perfect wear-leveling. Recent studies have proposed redirection or correction schemes to alleviate this problem, but all suffer from poor throughput or latency. On contrary, we present On-Demand Page Paired PCM (OD3P), a technique that mitigates the problem of fast failure of pages by redirecting them onto other healthy pages, leading to gradual capacity degradation. Compared to a state-of-the-art error correction scheme for PCM, our experiments indicated that OD3P can improve PCM time-to-failure and system performance (IPC) by 12% and 14%, respectively, under multi-threaded and multi-programmed workloads.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881391","Lifetime;Page Pairing","Arrays;Indexes;Phase change materials;Random access memory;Registers;Resistance","error correction;multi-threading;multiprogramming;paged storage;phase change memories","DRAM;IPC;OD3P;PCM applicability;PCM time-to-failure;cell lifetime;error correction scheme;memory pages;memory scalability;multiprogrammed workloads;multithreaded workloads;on-demand page paired PCM;phase change memory;process variation;system performance;wear-leveling","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the floorplan of dies on the interposer and the signal assignment for macro-bumps and TSVs will largely impact the wirelength of the interconnects in a 2.5D IC. Because long interconnects would degrade the performance of 2.5D ICs, the multi-die floorplanning problem and signal assignment problem for 2.5D ICs are critical. This paper presents an enumeration-based algorithm and a network-flow-based algorithm to solve the multi-die floorplanning and signal assignment problems in a 2.5D IC, respectively. Also, to speed up the floorplanning and signal assignment algorithms, several acceleration techniques are proposed.

Then these subtasks are distributed to different computing nodes and processed in parallel. Within each node, after the matrix factorization at the beginning of simulation, the adaptive time stepping solver is performed without extra matrix re-factorizations. MATEX overcomes the stiffness hinder of previous matrix exponential-based circuit simulator by rational Krylov subspace method, which leads to larger step sizes with smaller dimensions of Krylov subspace bases and highly accelerates the whole computation.

In this paper, we propose a model which estimates the thermal sustainable power capacity considering these two run-time factors. The model converts the thermal effect of threading strategies and core configurations into power capacity, which provides a context-based power budget for the power budgeting. Based on this model, we introduce a power budgeting framework aiming to optimize the performance within thermal constraints, named as TSocket.

However, power failure may occur at any time and result in loss of important data. Crash recovery therefore becomes vitally important in NAND flash memory storage systems. As flash translation layer (FTL) directly manages flash memory using various metadata, the problem of FTL crash recovery in NAND flash is how to efficiently and effectively maintain and recover the consistency of FTL metadata after system crash. In this paper, we present DCR, a deterministic approach to crash recovery for NAND flash based storage systems. The basic idea is to exploit the determinism of FTL and reproduce events that happened between the last checkpoint and the crash point during crash recovery. Different from existing approaches which have to scan the whole flash memory chip, we show that DCR can recover the system more efficiently by only checking a limited number of blocks based on deterministic FTL operations. We have implemented DCR for a block-level FTL and compared it with a popular version-based scheme using an ARM11-based embedded evaluation board. Experimental results show that DCR can greatly reduce recovery time and guarantee the consistency of FTL metadata after recovery.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881475","NAND flash memory;crash recovery;reliability","Ash;Benchmark testing;Computer crashes;Flash memories;Random access memory;Resource management;Virtual private networks","NAND circuits;flash memories","ARM11-based embedded evaluation board;FTL crash recovery;FTL metadata;NAND flash based storage systems;NAND flash memory;block-level FTL;deterministic crash recovery;flash memory chip;flash translation layer","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VIX improves switch allocation by allowing more than one input VC of an input port to transmit flits in the same cycle. Also, more input VCs can participate in the output arbitration, reducing the chances of uncoordinated decisions. VIX improves network throughput by more than 15% for the topologies studied without affecting the router critical path.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881430","network-on-chip;switch-allocation;throughput","Delays;Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Resource management;Switches;Throughput;Topology","multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","on-chip routers;separable allocators;sub-optimal switch allocation;virtual channel;virtual input crossbars","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM outperforms single level cell (SLC) in terms of capacity while suffering from a weaker cell endurance. Wear leveling strategies are proposed to enhance the endurance but encounters more challenges with the aggravating process variation. Due to endurance variations, balanced write traffic cannot fully exploit the PCM endurance since the weak parts will be worn out sooner than others. In this work, considering process variation, we propose an SLC-enabled wear leveling scheme through dynamic and adaptive mode transformation from MLC to SLC. Instead of redistributing write operations, the proposed scheme dynamically transforms weak and write-dense parts into SLC mode for endurance benefits. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the endurance by 215% with 4% storage overhead while maintaining the capacity advantage of MLC, compared with the most related work.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881363","PCM;endurance;process variation;wear leveling","Educational institutions;Phase change materials;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Resistance;Switches;Transforms","elemental semiconductors;phase change memories;silicon;write-once storage","MLC PCM;SLC-enabled wear leveling;Si;adaptive mode transformation;aggravating process variation;deep silicon regime;dynamic mode transformation;multilevel cell;phase change memory;single level cell;storage overhead;weaker cell endurance;write operations","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although battery packs usually incorporate some cell balancing circuitry, it is supposed to balance cell voltages dynamically at the expense of bypassed (not stored) charge. In this paper, we address the issue of how to consider variability when building battery packs based on a recently introduced combined cell-to-cell variation model of the capacity and of the internal resistance of a Li-Ion battery that accounts for variability effects in the cell manufacturing process. We attempt to figure out what kind of pack-level variability should be managed to reduce the cost of the cell balancing. We qualitatively evaluate inter- and intra-column variance minimizing cell placement approaches from the perspective of the passive cell balancing cost while considering the correlation between capacity and internal resistance.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive thermal management approach to improve the lifetime reliability of multicore systems by considering both inter- and intra-application thermal variations. Fundamental to this approach is a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns the relationship between the mapping of threads to cores, the frequency of a core and its temperature (sampled from on-board thermal sensors). Action is provided by overriding the operating system's mapping decisions using affinity masks and dynamically changing CPU frequency using in-kernel governors. Lifetime improvement is achieved by controlling not only the peak and average temperatures but also thermal cycling, which is an emerging wear-out concern in modern systems. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using an Intel quad-core platform executing a diverse set of multimedia benchmarks. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach minimizes average temperature, peak temperature and thermal cycling, improving the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by an average of 2× for intra-application and 3× for inter-application scenarios when compared to existing thermal management techniques. Furthermore, the dynamic and static energy consumption are also reduced by an average 10% and 11% respectively.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881497","","Legged locomotion;Linux;Reliability;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit reliability;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;thermal management (packaging)","CPU frequency;adaptive thermal management;affinity masks;average temperature minimization;in-kernel governor;interapplication thermal optimization;intraapplication thermal optimization;lifetime reliability;mean-time-to-failure improvement;multicore system lifetime improvement;multimedia benchmark;peak temperature minimization;reinforcement learning;thermal cycling minimization;thermal profile","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we group the processing cores into islands and propose an NoC-based multicore architecture for intra- and inter-island communication. The high scalability of the proposed platform allows us to integrate from 100 to 1200 cores for the folding computation.

Collaborative mobile crowdsensing enables information to be gathered and shared by users who are directly involved (participatory sensing) or integrated seamlessly as needed (opportunistic sensing) through user mobile platforms. To address the scalability needs of the mobile ecosystem, we additionally employ compressive sensing techniques for approximate gathering and processing of sensor data - this requires new mechanisms for sensor data collection, tunable approximate processing, and mobile networking architecture, to create a compressive collaborative mobile crowdsensing platform called SenseDroid. The proposed framework is build using a multi-tired hierarchical architecture to sense spatial variations of a parameter of interest, perceive spatio-temporal fields, and enable energy efficient local mobile sensing with a small number of measurements. This approximate, yet tunable approach combines different sensing approaches opportunistically while trading scalability (and coverage) for data accuracy (and energy efficiency).

This is particularly true in the automotive domain, where the code auto-generated from Simulink/Stateflow models is directly flashed onto embedded controllers. Testing based approaches are popular for validating the translation of models to code. However, these approaches cannot guarantee the absence of bugs introduced during translation. We use translation validation as an alternative to testing. By checking the equivalence between a Stateflow model and C code, it can provide formal guarantees about the absence of bugs introduced during translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of translation validation to code generation from hierarchical state-machine modeling languages. Our approach builds upon the significant progress over the last few years in software model-checking: we use a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf software model-checker, CBMC, to make translation validation practical for a complex modeling language like Stateflow.

In this work, we focus on the application and management of battery storage for energy-efficient buildings. We will first introduce a system-level approach to co-schedule the usage of battery storage (in addition to grid electricity) with the control of building HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, to reduce the total building energy cost, including the electricity consumption charge, the peak demand charge, and the battery cost. Then, in a separate formulation, we will introduce another system-level study to reduce the energy cost of EV charging and other fixed building energy load through the usage of battery storage and solar PV. Finally, we will present an ARM processor based programmable embedded battery management system (BMS), which monitors battery status, controls charging and discharging at the circuit level, and provides battery protection. The system also works with off-the-shelf battery management IC (Texas Instrument BMS sensor IC) from industry. Comparing to conventional BMS, this software module based BMS is a more suitable solution for energy efficient buildings due to its high flexibility, scalability, and reusability.

The key of the mechanism is to decide (1) how the unreliable components are utilized and (2) how to set the worst-case estimated response time. The local compensation has to start when the unreliable components do not deliver the results in the estimated response time. We propose a scheduling algorithm and its schedulability test to analyze the feasibility of the compensation mechanism. To validate the proposed mechanism, we perform a case study based on image-processing applications in a robot system and simulations.

While this approach suffices to guarantee functional correctness of the system, as needed for certification against safety standards (e.g., ISO26262), it fails to provide any timing guarantee as the time elapsed since the error occurs until lockstep detects it can be inordinately large. In this paper (i) we analyse the timing behaviour of errors in light lockstep systems, showing that a significant fraction of errors may remain undetected for long periods. Then, (ii) we put this problem in the context of certification against safety standards.

The widening latency gap between high speed cores and memory has led to the evolution of multi-level SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchies that exploit the latency benefits of smaller caches (e.g. private L1 and L2 SRAM caches) and the capacity benefits of larger caches (e.g. shared L3 SRAM and shared L4 DRAM cache). The main problem of employing large L3/L4 caches is their high tag lookup latency. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel concept of small and low latency SRAM/DRAM Tag-Cache structures that can quickly determine whether an access to the large L3/L4 caches will be a hit or a miss. The performance of the proposed Tag-Cache architecture depends upon the Tag-Cache hit rate and to improve it we propose a novel Tag-Cache insertion policy and a DRAM row buffer mapping policy that reduce the latency of memory requests. For a 16-core system, this improves the average harmonic mean instruction per cycle throughput of latency sensitive applications by 13.3% compared to state-of-the-art.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881364","","Arrays;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Organizations;Program processors;Radiation detectors;Random access memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;cache storage","DRAM row buffer mapping policy;SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchy;average harmonic mean instruction;high speed cores;high tag lookup latency;multi-core chip;private L1 SRAM caches;private L2 SRAM caches;shared L3 SRAM cache;shared L4 DRAM cache;tag-cache architecture;tag-cache insertion policy;widening latency gap","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior work has also shown that attackers can manipulate voltage supply and temperature to bias the TRNG output.

The TI-TRNG enhances power supply noise for older technologies and uses a self-calibration mechanism that reduces bias in TRNG output due to aging and attacks.

Our technique is based on the observation that many GPGPU applications achieve optimal performance with only a portion of cores due to either bandwidth saturation or shared resource contention. During run-time, given the dynamically tracked NBTI-induced threshold voltage shift and the problem size of GPGPU applications, our algorithm returns the optimal number of cores using detailed performance modeling. The unused cores are power-gated for power saving and NBTI recovery.

An increase in the voltage drop above the threshold level, caused by EM-induced increase in resistances of the individual interconnect segments, is considered as a failure criterion. It replaces a currently employed conservative weakest segment criterion, which does not account an essential redundancy for current propagation existing in the power-ground (p/g) networks. EM-induced increase in the resistance of the individual grid segments is described in the approximation of the recently developed physics-based formalism for void nucleation and growth. A statistical approach to calculation of the void nucleation times in the group of branches comprising the interconnect tree is implemented. As a result, p/g networks become time-varying linear networks. A developed technique for calculating the hydrostatic stress evolution inside a multi-branch interconnect tree allows to avoid over optimistic prediction of the time-to-failure (TTF) made with the Blech-Black analysis of individual branches of interconnect tree. Experimental results obtained on a number of IBM benchmark circuits validate the proposed methodology.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881407","MTTF;electromigration;hydrostatic stress;power grid","Current density;Mathematical model;Metals;Power grids;Resistance;Stress;Wires","VLSI;electric potential;electromigration;fault trees;integrated circuit reliability;linear network analysis;power grids;power integrated circuits;redundancy;time-varying networks","Blech-Black analysis;IBM benchmark circuits;TTF;VLSI systems;failure criterion;grid segment;hydrostatic stress evolution;multibranch interconnect tree;p/g networks;physics-based electromigration assessment;power delivery network;power grid network;power-ground network;redundancy;statistical approach;time-to-failure;time-varying linear network;void nucleation;voltage drop","","1","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Random Number Generators (RNGs) start to appear in recent modern Intel CPUs as used in desktops and servers. Solutions for embedded devices, such as e.g. sensor nodes and wireless routers, are still severely lacking however. In this paper we present the implementation of a secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller family, one of the most popular embedded platforms at this moment. For compactness and compatibility reasons, our implementation is software only. It uses the start-up values of on-chip SRAM as random seed and uses the KECCAK hash function for both entropy extraction as well as pseudo-random number generation. Getting KECCAK very compact in terms of memory requirements is therefore essential. KECCAK is a tunable algorithm: in this paper we discuss the minimum security requirements and the storage costs as a function of the KECCAK variant. The KECCAK permutation of our choice, KECCAK-f[200], is implemented in only 400 bytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest KECCAK implementation published so far. With the addition of initialization, hashing, padding and output generation functions, our complete solution fits within 496 bytes of ROM and requires 52 bytes of RAM. One byte of pseudo-random data, with a security level of at least 128 bits, can be generated in 3337 cyles on an ARM CortexM3/4, i.e. 50 KiB/s on a development board, plenty fast for a cryptographic PRNG in an embedded setting.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881438","Embedded devices;Keccak;Random Number Generation","Cryptography;Entropy;Microcontrollers;NIST;Random access memory;Read only memory","SRAM chips;cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;file organisation;microcontrollers;random number generation;software engineering","ARM Cortex M3-4;ARM Cortex-M microcontroller family;Intel CPU;Keccak hash function;Keccak permutation;Keccak variant;Keccak-based secure PRNG;Keccak-f[200];cryptographic PRNG;cryptographic protocols;embedded devices;entropy extraction;on-chip SRAM;pseudorandom data;pseudorandom number generation;pseudorandom number generator;sensor nodes;storage costs;wireless routers","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate such overhead, we propose the error-correcting cache (EC-Cache) that exploits the “error locality” of NAND flash. Error locality means that the majority of errors in reads to the same NAND flash page appear in the same positions until the page is erased. By caching detected errors, EC-Cache can correct a significant portion of errors present in a requested flash page before the associated LDPC decoding process begins. EC-Cache can greatly speed up LDPC decoding because LDPC's latency is directly correlated to the number of errors present in the input data. Experimental results show that EC-Cache achieves up to 2.6× SSD read performance gain.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881472","LDPC;NAND flash;SSD;bit errors;cache","Bit error rate;Decoding;Encoding;Flash memories;Iterative decoding;Sensors","NAND circuits;cache storage;decoding;error correction codes;flash memories;parity check codes","EC-cache;LDPC decoding process;LDPC latency;NAND flash page;NAND flash-based SSD;baseline error-correction codes;decoding procedure;error locality;error-correcting cache;error-correcting capability;low-density parity-check","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In comparison with the other schemes, dual-issue scheme may achieve the best performance, but it requires compiler support - which does not exist. In this paper, we develop compiler techniques to map loops with conditionals on CGRA for the dual-issue scheme.

While some communication traffic requires immediate resource allocations (such as voice services), an increasing number of mobile phone applications produce a lot of background communication traffic (e.g. social network apps, crowd sensing services). In this paper we discuss the predictive Channel-Aware Transmission (pCAT) scheme, which leverages the fact, that favorable channel conditions require much less spectrum resource allocation than bad channel conditions. By leveraging the knowledge of user trajectories and recurring spots with favorable channel conditions, the so-called LTE connectivity hot spots, background traffic transmissions can be scheduled by the client according to expected channel quality and application data priority. Thereby, the spectrum consumption of background traffic of applications can be reduced significantly. At the same time, the efficient usage of spectrum resources has also an impact on the battery lifetime of the mobile devices. By introducing the Context-Aware Power Consumption Model (CoPoMo) for LTE communications, we highlight, how decisions about the spectrum resource allocation by the network will impact the battery lifetime. One case study will show, that by simply changing the resource allocation scheme and without the need for spending more spectrum resources, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 70% using the Energy-Efficient Scheduling (EES) introduced in this paper.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2596686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881396","Channel-Aware Transmission;CoPoMo;Energy efficiency;Mobile Crowd Sensing;Resource-efficient Communication","Batteries;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Resource management;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Trajectory","Long Term Evolution;mobile communication;quality of experience;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","CoPoMo;EES;LTE communications;LTE connectivity hot spots;application data priority;background traffic transmissions;bad channel conditions;battery lifetime;channel quality;communication traffic;context-aware power consumption model;crowd-sensing;energy-efficient scheduling;mobile communications;mobile phone applications;pCAT scheme;predictive channel-aware transmission scheme;quality of experience;resource allocations;resource-efficient communication;spectrum resource allocation","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, PCM/MLC PCM suffers from long write latency and large write energy. Recent work has proposed a compiler directed dual-write (CDDW) scheme to combat the drawbacks of PCM by adopting fast or slow write mode for different write operations.

"Power / capacity scaling: Energy savings with simple fault-tolerant caches","Gottscho, M.; BanaiyanMofrad, A.; Dutt, N.; Nicolau, A.; Gupta, P.","Electr.

We propose static (SPCS) and dynamic (DPCS) variants of power/capacity scaling, a simple and low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture that utilizes insights gained from our 45nm SOI test chip. Our mechanism combines multi-level voltage scaling with power gating of blocks that become faulty at each voltage level. The SPCS policy sets the runtime cache VDD statically such that almost all of the cache blocks are not faulty. The DPCS policy opportunistically reduces the voltage further to save more power than SPCS while limiting the impact on performance caused by additional faulty blocks. Through an analytical evaluation, we show that our approach can achieve lower static power for all effective cache capacities than a recent complex FTVS work. This is due to significantly lower overheads, despite the failure of our approach to match the min-VDD of the competing work at fixed yield. Through architectural simulations, we find that the average energy saved by SPCS is 55%, while DPCS saves an average of 69% of energy with respect to baseline caches at 1 V. Our approach incurs no more than 4% performance and 5% area penalties in the worst case cache configuration.","","","","10.1145/2593069.2593184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881427","","Arrays;Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;SRAM cells","SRAM chips;cache storage;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;silicon-on-insulator","DPCS;FTVS;SOI test chip;SPCS policy;analytical evaluation;architectural simulations;dynamic power-capacity scaling variants;energy savings;fault-tolerant voltage-scalable SRAM cache architectures;low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture;multilevel voltage scaling;power gating;runtime cache VDD;simple fault-tolerant caches;size 45 nm;static power-capacity scaling variants;voltage 1 V;worst case cache configuration","","2","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Function ? describes the scale-out speedup and function ? handles the scale-up speedup. The ? model can clearly tell not only the overall speedup of a given multithreading and core mapping strategy, but also how to improve the multithreading and core mapping, hence should be a promising performance predictor for future heterogenous many-cores. The results show that ? model's error rate is within 12%, which is lower than state-of-the-art methods.

In addition near/sub-threshold can result in higher sensitivity to process-induced variations and transient noise. FinFETs have been proposed as an alternative to planar CMOS devices in sub-20nm CMOS technology nodes due to their more effective channel control, steep sub-threshold slope, high ON/OFF current ratio, low power consumption, and so on. Characteristics of FinFETs operating in the near/sub-threshold regime make it difficult to verify the timing of a circuit using conventional statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) techniques. Current source modeling (CSM) methods, which have been proposed to increase the accuracy of timing analysis in dealing with arbitrary shapes of the input signal waveforms, are the appropriate solution for performing SSTA on FinFET-based circuits. This paper thus extends the CSM to such circuits, operating in the near/sub-threshold voltage regime. In particular, FinFET devices with independent gate control and subject to process variations are modelled. The key idea of the proposed CSM approach is to combine non-linear analytical models and low-dimensional CSM lookup tables to simultaneously achieve high modeling accuracy and low time/space complexity.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742884","","Capacitance;FinFETs;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Table lookup;Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;semiconductor device models;table lookup","CSM lookup tables;FinFET devices;ON/OFF current ratio;SSTA;channel control;independent gate control;near threshold voltage regime;planar CMOS devices;process variation;semi-analytical current source modeling;statistical static timing analysis;sub-threshold slope;subthreshold voltage regime;transient noise","","0","","25","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intermittent faults occur due to stressed resources and often are a precursor of permanent faults. The proposed early fault detection and diagnosis allows the use of precautionary measures before the permanent failure of a component in a distributed system occurs. In this paper, we present four methods that can implicitly detect intermittent faults by taking the distributed applications and their dependencies into account. Thus, explicit tests are not required which would lead to additional costs and resource load. On the other hand, the implicit approach may considerably reduce the number of plausibility tests compared to the conservative solution with one test per resource. We analyzed and evaluated implementations of the proposed fault detection principle. The experimental results give evidence of the feasibility of our approach and show a comparison of the implemented methods in terms of runtime and detection rate.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742964","","Equations;Fault detection;Mathematical model;Reliability;Runtime;Transient analysis;Vectors","distributed processing;fault diagnosis;software reliability","distributed systems;fault detection principle;fault diagnosis;implicit intermittent fault detection;permanent faults;precautionary measures;unavoidable transient faults","","1","","14","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, the NAND flash cell bit error rate is reduced, leading to system endurance extension.

However, test inflation in parallel ATPG yet arises as a critical problem and limits its practicality. Therefore, we developed a parallel ATPG system that incorporates (1) concurrent interruption (CI), (2) ripple compaction (RC) and (3) fan-in-cone based fault ordering (FIC) to deal with such problem. Concurrent interruption aborts test generation on simultaneously detected faults by fault simulation. Ripple compaction combines tests for different faults while fan-in-cone based fault ordering strategically arranges the fault list to reduce the number of test generations and thus speeds up the ATPG process. According to our experiments, the proposed parallel ATPG system effectively reduces 11% pattern count and achieves ~0% test inflation while maintaining an average of 6.5X speedup with no attenuation in fault coverage on experimental circuits.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742967","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit faults;Compaction;Interrupters;Logic gates;Parallel processing;Program processors","automatic test pattern generation;fault diagnosis;fault tolerant computing;interrupts;parallel machines;shared memory systems","automatic test pattern generation;concurrent interruption;fan-in-cone based-fault ordering;fault coverage;fault detection;fault simulation;multicore machine;parallel ATPG system;ripple compaction;shared memory system;test inflation suppression","","0","","14","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It employs a heuristic to construct sparse polynomial expansions and a stepwise regression algorithm based on LASSO to find low degree polynomial approximations. The proposed technique is able to handle many tens of process parameters with a small number of simulations when compared to an earlier approach using ordinary least squares. We present our approach in the context of statistical model inference (SMI), a recently proposed statistical verification framework for transistor-level circuits. Our experimental evaluation compares percentage yields predicted by our approach with Monte-Carlo simulations and SMI using ordinary least squares on benchmarks with up to 30 process parameters.

The central idea is to use fuzzy logic to mimic the behavior of an expert that can recognize the network status and then intelligently control the admission of input flows.

In previous global routing formulations, the routing resources over the IP blocks were either dealt as routing blockages leading to a significant waste, or simply treated in the same way as outside-the-block routing resources, which violates the slew constraints and thus fail buffering. Utilizing over-the-block routing resources could dramatically improve the routing solution, yet requires special attention, since the slew, affected by different RC on different metal layers, must be constrained by buffering and is easily violated. Moreover, even all nets are slew-legalized, the routing solution could still suffer from heavy congestion problem. For the first time, BOB-Router tries to solve the over-the-block global routing problem through minimizing overflows, wirelength and via count simultaneously without violating slew constraints. BOB-Router generates a slew-legalized initial solution followed by a Lagrangian-multiplier-based pricing phase and RC-constrained A* search to help explore new buffering-aware topologies on all metal layers. Our experimental results show that BOB-Router completely satisfies the slew constraints and significantly outperforms the obstacle-avoiding global routers in terms of wirelength, via count and overflows.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742943","","Benchmark testing;Law;Metals;Routing;Steiner trees;Topology","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;microprocessor chips;network routing;search problems","BOB-router;IP blocks;Lagrangian-multiplier-based pricing;RC-constrained A* search;buffering-aware global router;buffering-aware topology;metal layers;obstacle-avoiding global routers;outside-the-block routing resources;over-the-block global routing resource problem;over-the-block routing resource optimization;routing blockages;slew constraints;slew-legalized initial solution;via count;via overflows;wireleng minimization","","0","","22","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose using STT-RAM to construct TLBs in light of the unique memory access pattern in GPUs, i.e., infrequent data updates. STT-RAM TLB can replace its same-area SRAM counterpart with greater capacity, similar read performance and lower energy consumption. As an optimization of STT-RAM TLB, we further propose a STT-RAM-based dynamically-configurable TLB (STD-TLB) by leveraging differential sensing technique. STD-TLB can switch between high-capacity mode and high-performance mode on-the-fly based on real-time application needs. Our experiments show that compared to SRAM TLB, standard STT-RAM TLB improves the performance and energy delay product of GPU address translation by 32% and 75%, respectively, while STD-TLB achieves additional 15% and 13% improvements over standard STT-RAM TLB.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742915","","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Graphics processing units;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Sensors;Standards","buffer storage;graphics processing units;random-access storage","GPU architectures;SRAM cell area;SRAM-based TLB;STD-TLB;STT-RAM TLB optimization;STT-RAM-based dynamically-configurable TLB;differential sensing technique;graphics processing unit architectures;high-capacity mode;high-performance mode on-the-fly;infrequent data updates;memory access pattern;real-time application needs;translation lookaside buffer;virtual memory addressing","","1","","29","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We attempt to solve this problem by proposing an Adaptive Power Allocation Technique (APAT) that uses a dynamic programming network. Our goal here is to maximize the overall system performance, taking into account a unique yet challenging fact that, available power budget might have to undergo a significant change when a renewable energy source is scavenging. APAT has a linear time complexity and low hardware overhead. Experiments have confirmed that APAT can reduce 20 ~ 30% of execution time compared to other state-of-the-art power allocation algorithms. In addition, as APAT is quite insensitive to the changing rate of the power, lending itself well for power management in many-core systems powered by energy-harvesting sources.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742906","","Dynamic programming;Frequency modulation;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Renewable energy sources;Resource management;Tiles","dynamic programming;energy harvesting;integrated circuit interconnections;renewable energy sources","APAT;adaptive power allocation technique;agile frequency scaling;dynamic programming network;energy-harvesting sources;execution time;linear time complexity;low-hardware overhead;low-power electronics;many-core systems;multicore-many-core-based devices;power budget allocation;power changing rate;power management;power-performance optimization problem;renewable energy source","","1","","14","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose and analyze the usage of fine-grained voltage islands to cope with the increased effect of variability problem in the NTC region. For the considered workloads, we found that the power impact of fine-grained voltage islands formation can be up to 35% for a 128-core chip operating at NTC region, while the adoption of a variability aware technique can bring to a power reduction of up to 43% with respect to a variability unaware technique.

The maximum power point tracking is conventionally performed by an MPPT charger that stores in the energy storage element, and a voltage regulator (typically a DC-DC converter) produces a proper voltage level for the microprocessor. The energy storage element is an energy buffer and makes it possible to perform MPPT of the PV cells and power management of the microprocessor independently. However, the energy storage element, MPPT charger and DC-DC converter cause seriously limited lifetime (when a typical battery is adopted), significant energy loss (typically over 20%), increased weight/volume and high cost, etc. The proposed method enables extremely fine-grain dynamic power management (DPM) in every a few hundred microseconds and performs the MPPT without using an MPPT charger and a DC-DC converter as well as an energy storage element.

Margin is indeed necessary between some cell pairs, but there are also lots of cell pairs that do not yield any defects (or have very low probability of defects) when they are placed without margin. We address a new placement problem using standard cells without inter-cell margin. Placement should be done such that defect probability is made as small as possible while standard objectives such as wirelength is also pursued. The key in this approach is efficient computation of defect probabilities of all cell pairs and arranging them as a table that is referred to by a placer.

One way of resolving these is by imposing a large spacing constraint between a pair of shapes participant in an odd cycle. However, this may shrink spacing in other parts of the layout and introduce DRC violations or new DPT conflicts. In this work, we model DPT conflict resolution as a constrained linear optimization problem, look ahead to upfront estimate potential violations and preclude them with additional constraints. We borrow the approach of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to simultaneously check satisfiability of linear constraint set and resolution of DPT conflicts. These two are interleaved and feed information to each other to churn out a feasible set of constraints that fixes DPT and DRC violations. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on layouts at advanced nodes.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742881","","Context;Engines;Geometry;Image edge detection;Layout;Shape;Vectors","computability;linear programming;masks;photolithography","DPT conflict resolution;SMT solvers;constrained linear optimization problem;double patterning technology;fixing double patterning violations;large spacing constraint;layout shapes;linear constraint set;lithography;satisfiability modulo theory","","0","","15","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these applications in biochemistry require high precision to avoid erroneous assay outcomes, and therefore are vulnerable to contamination between two fluidic flows with different biochemistries. Moreover, to wash contaminated sites, the buffer solution in flow-based biochips has to be guided along pre-etched channel networks. This constraint makes washing in flow-based microfluidics even harder. In this paper, we propose the first approach for automated wash optimization for contamination removal in flow-based microfluidic biochips. The proposed approach targets the generation of washing pathways to clean all contaminated microchannels with minimum execution time. A path dictionary is first established by pre-searching physically implementable paths in a given chip layout. When wash targets and occupied microchannels are defined, the proposed methods determine an optimized path set with the least washing time by calculating the priorities of wash targets. Two fabricated biochips are used to evaluate the proposed washing method. Compared to an ad hoc baseline method, the proposed approach leads to more efficient washing in all cases.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742897","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742897","","Contamination;Dictionaries;Layout;Microchannel;Optimization;Reservoirs;Valves","bioMEMS;biochemistry;biotechnology;decontamination;diseases;drugs;lab-on-a-chip;microchannel flow;patient diagnosis","biochemistry-on-a-chip;buffer solution;contaminated microchannels;cross-contamination removal;drug discovery;flow-based microfluidic biochips;path dictionary;point-of-care disease diagnosis;wash optimization","","1","","12","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the capacities and benefits of a major potential demand side, the data center, to provide RS. We propose a dynamic control policy that modulates the data center power consumption in response to ISO requests by leveraging server power capping techniques and various server power states. Results demonstrate that using our policy, data centers can provide fast reserves in quantities that are substantial proportions (around 50%) of their average energy consumption, with no major deterioration in quality of service (QoS). By doing so, data centers decrease their energy costs around 50%, while providing the ISOs and the society in general with cost effective demand side reserves that render massive renewable generation adoption affordable.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742874","","Degradation;ISO;Power control;Power demand;Power markets;Quality of service;Servers","computer centres;demand side management;power markets;power system stability;quality of service;smart power grids","QoS;data center power consumption modulation;demand side regulation service;demand side reserves;dynamic control policy;grid load stabilizer;power market;quality of service;renewable generation;server power capping techniques","","3","","31","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this algorithm, the level of contiguousness of the allocated processors (?) can be adjusted in a fine-grained fashion. A strictly contiguous allocation (? = 0) decreases the latency and power dissipation of the network and improves the applications execution time. However, it limits the achievable throughput and increases the turnaround time of the applications. As a result, recent works consider non-contiguous allocation (? = 1) to improve the throughput traded off against applications execution time and network metrics. In contradiction, our experiments show that a higher throughput (by 3%) with improved network performance can be achieved when using intermediate ? values. More precisely, up to 35% drop in the network costs can be gained by adjusting the level of contiguity compared to non-contiguous cases, while the achieved throughput is kept constant. Moreover, CASqA provides at least 32% energy saving in the network compared to other works.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742914","Application Mapping;Contiguous Task Mapping;Dynamic Many-Core Systems;Processor allocation","Dispersion;Energy dissipation;Measurement;Power dissipation;Program processors;Resource management;Throughput","multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","CASqA;adjustable contiguity;allocated processor contiguousness;energy saving;network costs;network on chip;noncontiguous allocation;power dissipation;run-time mapping algorithm;run-time task allocation","","2","","22","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The emerging smart grid aims to create an automated energy delivery system that enables two-way flows of electricity and information. As a result, it will be desirable if OPF can be solved in real time in order to allow the implementation of the time-sensitive applications, such as real-time pricing. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) through power system network reduction (NR). We formulate the OPF problem based on an equivalent reduced system and interpret its solution and the detailed optimal dispatch for the original power system is obtained afterwards using a distributed algorithm. Our results are compared with two widely used methods: full ACOPF and the linearized OPF with DC power flow and lossless network assumption, the so-called DCOPF. Experimental results show that for a large power system, our method achieves 7.01X speedup over ACOPF with only 1.72% error, and is 75.7% more accurate than the DCOPF solution. Our method is even 10% faster than DCOPF. Our experimental results demonstrate the unique strength of the proposed technique for fast, scalable, and accurate OPF computation. We also show that our method is effective for smaller benchmarks.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742918","","Approximation methods;Equations;Generators;Mathematical model;Power generation;Power systems;Real-time systems","load flow;smart power grids","ACOPF;alternating current optimal power flow;automated energy delivery system;fast large-scale optimal power flow analysis;network reduction;power system network reduction;power system operation;smart grid","","1","","16","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these cases, spatial multitasking better exploits the parallelism offered by GPUs by partitioning the GPU resources among simultaneously-running applications. When one or more such applications have quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, enough resources must be allocated for those applications to satisfy their requirements. Remaining resources can be either disabled to reduce power consumption or used to accelerate other applications. However, we observe that the amount of resources for a QoS application to satisfy its performance requirement is dependent in part upon the co-executing applications. In this paper, we propose a runtime technique to dynamically partition GPU resources between concurrently running applications - at least one of which has a QoS requirement. We demonstrate that the proposed technique can satisfy a 100% QoS requirement while also achieving either a 7W power consumption reduction or a 17.57% performance improvement for co-executing best-effort applications.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742976","","Dynamic scheduling;Graphics processing units;Heuristic algorithms;Multitasking;Power demand;Quality of service;Resource management","graphics processing units;quality of service;resource allocation","GPGPU computing;QoS-aware dynamic resource allocation;dynamically partition resources;general-purpose computing;power 7 W;quality-of-service requirements;runtime technique;simultaneously-running applications;spatial-multitasking GPU","","1","","15","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we propose a unified online DAG monitoring solution independent from the connected scheduler and able to handle all possible DAG models. Our novel low-complexity solution processes online the DAG of the application and provides relevant information about each task that can be used by any scheduler connected to it. Using H.264/AVC video decoding as an illustrative application and multiple configurations of complex synthetic DAGs, we demonstrate that our solution connected to an external simple energy-efficient scheduler is able to achieve significant improvements in energy-efficiency and deadline miss rates compared to existing approaches.","","","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742974","","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Decoding;Monitoring;Multimedia communication;Schedules;Streaming media","decoding;directed graphs;power aware computing;processor scheduling;video coding","DAG monitoring modules;DAG schedulers;H.264/AVC video decoding;complex synthetic DAGs;external simple energy-efficient scheduler;low-complexity solution;multicore scheduler system;task dependency;unified online directed acyclic graph flow manager","","1","","18","","","20-23 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 14 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, while 2013 CAD contest attracted 87 teams from 9 regions. Continuing its great success in 2012 and 2013, 2014 CAD contest attracts 93 teams from 9 regions, including Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, US, Canada, Brazil, and Russian Federation. Three contest problems on verification, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Chih-Jen Hsu of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on efficiently solving the combinational single-output netlists. The efficiency of solving a single-output function highly depends on the CNF encoding and the SAT solving. For the first problem, contestants are required to explore the best CNF encoding and SAT solver setting to solve the most tests within the shortest runtime. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on incremental timing-driven placement. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total slack and worst slack are optimized. Topic chair Rasit O. Topaloglu of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. In a circuit layout, densities of polygons within windows of interest may have a large v- riation across such windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, fills are inserted to make the density of several windows uniform. For the third problem, contestants are required to minimize the density variation with least fills. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001374","Verification;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Educational institutions;Encoding;Force;Integrated circuits;Optimization","","","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to consider design and electrical complexities (e.g., crosstalk coupling, voltage drops) as well as manufacturing and environmental variations, timing analysis is typically done using an “early-late” split. The early-late split timing analysis enables timers to effectively account for any within-chip variation effects. However, this dual-mode analysis may introduce unnecessary pessimism, which can lead to an over-conservative design. Thus, common path pessimism removal (CPPR) is introduced to eliminate this pessimism during timing analysis. A naive approach would require the analysis of all paths in the design. For today's designs with millions of gates, enumerating all paths is impractical. In this paper, we propose a new approach to effectively prune the redundant paths and develop a multi-threaded timing analysis tool called MTimer for fast and accurate CPPR. The results show that our timer can achieve 3.53X speedup on average comparing with the winner of the TAU 2014 contest and maintain 100% accuracy on removing common path pessimism during timing analysis.","","978-1-4799-7790-1","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059033","Common path pessimism removal;Timing analysis","Accuracy;Clocks;Delays;Pins;Runtime;Synchronization","integrated circuit design;multi-threading;timing","MTimer;chip variation effect;common path pessimism removal;crosstalk coupling;dual mode analysis;early-late split timing analysis;electrical complexities;integrated circuit design;multithreaded timing analysis tool;redundant path pruning;static timing analysis;voltage drop","","0","","9","","","19-22 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is a current-steering DAC, and because the layout of current cells and standard digital cells are APRed together, the resulting custom design effort and time, power, and area are all minimized. Three different calibration algorithms are implemented in order to compensate for the systematic mismatch caused by APR, as well as the inter-die and intra-die variations. The DAC is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS technology, and achieves an SFDR >50dBc at up to a 100MHz input frequency while consuming only 5mW.
