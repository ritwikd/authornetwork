Based on the observation that HTs are usually activated by dedicated trigger inputs that are not sensitized with verification test cases, VeriTrust automatically identifies such potential HT trigger inputs by examining verification corners. The key difference between VeriTrust and existing HT detection techniques is that VeriTrust is insensitive to the implementation style of HTs. Experimental results show that VeriTrust is able to detect all HTs evaluated in this paper (constructed based on various HT design methodologies shown in the literature) at the cost of moderate extra verification time, which is not possible with existing solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560654","","Detection algorithms;Hardware;Integrated circuit modeling;Measurement;Payloads;Runtime","computer network security;program verification;trusted computing","Denial of Service attacks;HT design methodology;VeriTrust;design stage;hardware Trojan;hardware trust;infected devices;sensitive information leakage;verification test case","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regarding the similarity between constraint sets, the infeasible subspaces under a constraint set help identify the infeasible subspaces under another constraint set. The profiled results under each constraint set are then stored in a distinct range-splitting tree (RS-Tree). These trees accelerate pattern generation under multiple constraint sets and, simultaneously, ensure the produced patterns are evenly-distributed.

Consequently, it is desirable to simultaneously consider the co-design of the interposer and multiple chips mounted on it. This paper addresses the first work of chip-interposer codesign to place multiple chips on an interposer to reduce inter-chip wirelength. For this problem, we propose a new hierarchical B*-tree to simultaneously place multiple chips, macros, and I/O Buffers.

This paper for first time proposes a fast framework called XDRA, which allows the exploration of last-level cache configurations to improve DDR-DRAM energy efficiency. XDRA combines a processor-memory simulator, a cache simulator and novel analysis techniques to produce a Kriging based estimator which predicts the energy savings for differing cache configurations for a given main memory size and application. Errors for the estimator were less than 4.4% on average for 11 applications from mediabench and SPEC2000 suite and two DRAM sizes (Micron DDR3-DRAM 256MB and 4GB). Cache configurations selected by XDRA were on average 3.6× and 4× more energy efficient (cache and DRAM energy) than a common cache configuration. Optimal cache configurations were selected by XDRA 20 times out of 22. The two suboptimal configurations were at most 3.9% from their optimal counterparts.

In order to achieve successful decomposition, SADP-compliant design becomes a necessity. Spacer-Is-Dielectric (SID) is the most popular flavor of SADP with higher flexibility in design. This paper makes a careful study on the challenges for SID-compliant detailed routing and proposes a graph model to capture the decomposition violations and SID intrinsic residue issues. Then a negotiated congestion based scheme is adopted to solve the overall routing problem. The proposed SID-compliant detailed routing algorithm simultaneously assigns colors to the routed wires, which provides valuable information guiding SID decomposition. In addition, if one pin has multiple candidate locations, the optimal one will be automatically determined during detailed routing. The decomposability of the conflict-free routing layers produced by our detailed router is verified by a commercial SADP decomposition tool.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560686","SADP;SID-Compliant Detailed Routing","Color;Layout;Lithography;Metals;Routing;Switches;Wires","lithography;network routing;semiconductor device reliability","decomposition;metal layer fabrication;multiple candidate locations;self-aligned double patterning lithography;spacer-is-dielectric-compliant detailed routing","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By taking advantage of multilevel power grid verifications, large-scale power grid current integrity verification tasks can be achieved in a very efficient way. Additionally, a novel EM-aware geometric power grid reduction method is proposed to well preserve the similar geometric and electrical properties of the original grid on the coarse-level power grids, which allows to quickly identify the potential “hot wires” that may carry greater-than-desired currents in a given power grid design. The proposed multilevel power grid verification algorithm provides flexible tradeoffs between the current integrity verification cost and solution quality, while the desired upper/lower bounds for worst case currents flowing through a wire can also be computed efficiently.

In this work, we propose a methodology to minimize the energy consumption of NoC without violating the prespecified latency deadlines of real-time applications. First, we develop a formal approach based on network calculus to obtain the worst-case delay bound of all packets, from which we derive a safe estimate of the number of cycles that a packet can be further delayed in the network without violating its deadline- the worst-case slack. With this information, we then develop an optimization algorithm that trades the slacks for lower NoC energy. Our algorithm recognizes the distribution of slacks for different traffic streams, and assigns different voltages and frequencies to different routers to achieve NoC energy-efficiency, while meeting the deadlines for all packets.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560630","Network calculus;Network-on-Chip;Voltage-frequency scaling","Analytical models;Calculus;Delays;Embedded systems;Heuristic algorithms;Switches;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC complexity;chip power;energy consumption minimization;energy-efficient NoC design;formal approach;interconnection subsystems;latency requirement;network calculus;network-on-chip;real-time embedded systems;routers;slack optimization;time interval;traffic stream;traffic streams","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is important to detect the inconsistences between silicon devices and virtual prototypes. We present an approach to post-silicon conformance checking of a hardware device with its virtual prototype, i.e., a virtual device. The conformance between the silicon and virtual devices is defined over their interface states. This approach symbolically executes the virtual device with the same driver request sequence to the silicon device, and checks if the interface states of the silicon and virtual devices are consistent. Inconsistencies detected indicate potential errors in either the silicon device or the virtual device. We have evaluated our approach on three network adapters and their virtual devices, and found 15 inconsistencies exposing 15 real bugs in total from the silicon and virtual devices.

To facilitate monitoring and control, IMDs are often equipped with wireless interfaces. While convenient, wireless connectivity raises the risk of malicious access to an IMD that can potentially infringe patients' privacy and even endanger their lives. Thus, while ease of access to IMDs can be vital for timely medical intervention, too much ease is dangerous. Obvious approaches, such as passwords and certificates, are unworkable at large scale given the lack of central authorities and frequent emergencies in medical settings. Additionally, IMDs are heavily constrained in their power consumption and computational capabilities. Designing access-control mechanisms for IMDs that can meet the many constraints of real-world deployment is an important research challenge. In this paper, we review proposed approaches to the accesscontrol problem for IMDs, including the problem of secure pairing (and key distribution) between an IMD and another device, such as a programmer. (We also treat related technologies, such as bodyarea networks.) We describe some limitations of well-conceived proposals and reveal security weaknesses in two proposed cryptographic pairing schemes.

The total sum of these applications is several million lines of software code. The ECUs are connected to different sensors and actuators and communicate via a variety of communication buses like CAN, FlexRay and now also Ethernet. In the case of electric vehicles, both the amount and the importance of such electronics and software are even higher. Here, a number of hydraulic or pneumatic controls are replaced by corresponding software-implemented controllers in order to reduce the overall weight of the car and hence to improve its driving range. Until recently, most of the software and system design in the automotive domain - as in many other domains - relied on an always correctly functioning or a zero-defect hardware implementation platform. However, as the device geometries of integrated circuits continue to shrink, this assumption is increasingly not true. Incorporating large safety margins in the design process results in very pessimistic design and expensive processors. Further, the processors in cars - in contrast to those in many consumer electronics devices like mobile phones - are exposed to harsh environments, extreme temperature variations, and often, strong electromagnetic fields. Hence, their reliability is even more questionable and must be explicitly accounted for in all layers of design abstraction - starting from circuit design to architecture design, to software design and runtime management and monitoring. In this paper we outline some of these issues, currently followed practices, and the challenges that lie ahead of us in the automotive and electric vehicles domain.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560691","Electric vehicles;aging;automotive electronics;cross-layer;embedded systems;process variations;software","Automotive engineering;Degradation;Logic gates;Reliability engineering;Software;Transistors","automotive electronics;electric vehicles;reliability","ECU;Ethernet;FlexRay;architecture design;automotive domain;comfort related functionality;communication buse;consumer electronics device;design abstraction;driver assistance;electric vehicle domain;electric vehicles;electromagnetic field;electronic control unit;expensive processors;hydraulic control;mobile phones;pessimistic design;pneumatic control;reliability challenges;runtime management;safety critical control;software code;software design;system software;zero defect hardware implementation platform","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the contrary, linear superposition method is efficient to analyze stress in full-chip scale, but sometimes it fails to provide an accurate estimation since it neglects the stress induced by interactions between TSVs.

Regarding the system architecture, we present challenges in the domain of communication and computation platforms.

At the same time, novel computational devices promise high processing power at low cost which will make a reduction in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) possible. As a result, the software design has to be performed in a holistic manner, considering the controlled component while transparently abstracting the underlying hardware architecture. For this purpose, we show how middleware and verification techniques can help to reduce the design and test complexity.

As a result, the errors introduced in the responses, must occur during unloading of the scan chains. Diagnosis can then be performed by directly comparing the actual and expected responses without any fault simulation - leading to significant reduction in time.

Critical patterns cut by stitching lines could suffer from severe pattern distortion or even yield loss. Therefore, considering the positions of stitching lines and avoiding stitching line-induced bad patterns are required during layout design.

Using this design approach, we can carry out dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic physical constraints.

Recently, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) have been adopted to create an optimization system, named BDS, that supports integrated synthesis of both AND/OR- and XOR-intensive functions through functional logic decomposition on the BDD structure. However, it does not support direct decomposition and manipulation of majority logic which, instead, is widely used in datapath circuits. In this paper, we present the first BDD-based majority logic decomposition method and a logic decomposition system, BDS-MAJ, that enables efficient logic synthesis for both random control and datapath circuits. Experimental results show that logic synthesis based on BDSMAJ produces CMOS circuits having on average 28.8% and 26.4% less area and, at the same time, 12.8% and 20.9% smaller delay with respect to academic ABC and BDS synthesis tools.

In this paper, we present the first work that considers DPL during analog placement and simultaneously minimizes area, wirelength, and DPL conflicts. We first propose an extended conflict graph (ECG) to represent the relation between patterns of analog modules and apply an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to determine the orientation of each module and the color of each pattern for conflict minimization. ILP reduction schemes are proposed to further reduce the runtime. Finally, we present a three-stage flow and DPL-aware perturbations to obtain desired solutions.

While all code and data need to be managed, an efficient technique to manage stack data is of utmost importance since an average of 64% of all accesses may be to stack variables [16]. In this paper, we formulate the problem of stack data management optimization on an SMM core. We then develop both an ILP and a heuristic - SSDM (Smart Stack Data Management) to find out where to insert stack data management calls in the program.

Moreover, the problem becomes much hard to tackle as the delay of clock signals varies dynamically during execution. Recently, it is shown that adjustable delay buffer (ADB) whose delay can be adjusted dynamically can solve the clock skew variation problem effectively. However, inserting ADBs requires non-negligible area and control overhead. Thus, all previous works have invariably aimed at minimizing the number of ADBs to be inserted, particularly under the environment of multiple power modes in which the operating voltage applied to some modules varies as the power mode changes. In this work, unlike the previous works which have solved the ADB minimization problem heuristically or locally optimally, we propose an elegant and easily adoptable solution to overcome the limitation of the previous works. Precisely, we propose an O(n log n) time (bottom-up traversal) algorithm that (1) optimally solves the problem of minimizing the number of ADBs to be inserted with continuous delay of ADBs and (2) enables solving the ADB insertion problem with discrete delay of ADBs to be greatly simple and predictable. In addition, we propose (3) a systematic solution to an important extension to the problem of buffer sizing combined with the ADB insertion to further reduce the ADBs to be used.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560683","","Abstracts","buffer circuits;circuit complexity;circuit optimisation;clocks;delay circuits;integrated circuit design;minimisation;trees (mathematics)","ADB insertion problem;ADB minimization problem;adjustable delay buffer insertion;bottom-up traversal algorithm;buffer sizing;clock signal delay;clock skew constraint;clock skew variation problem;clock trees synthesis;continuous delay;control overhead;discrete delay;operating voltage;optimal algorithm;power mode;time algorithm","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we shall propose a novel wear leveling algorithm involving the operating system (OS). We will show that our operating System-Assisted Wear leveling (SAW) algorithm can significantly improve the wear evenness. SAW takes advantage of OS's knowledge about files at a higher level of abstraction, and provides useful hints to the lower-level FTL to accommodate data. A prototype based on a file system and an FTL has been developed to verify the effectiveness of SAW.

With extremely small sample size, traditional estimators are only capable of achieving a very low confidence level, leading to either over-validation or under-validation. In this paper, we propose a multi-population moment estimation method that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small sample size. In fact, the proposed estimator is theoretically guaranteed to outperform usual moment estimators. The key idea is to exploit the fact that simulation and measurement data collected under different circuit configurations and corners can be correlated, and are conditionally independent. We exploit such correlation among different populations by employing a Bayesian framework, i.e., by learning a prior distribution and applying maximum a posteriori estimation using the prior. We apply the proposed method to several datasets including post-silicon measurements of a commercial highspeed I/O link, and demonstrate an average error reduction of up to 2×, which can be equivalently translated to significant reduction of validation time and cost.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560658","","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Estimation;Nickel;Sociology;Standards;Statistics","belief networks;electric moments;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;probability","Bayesian inference;analog/mixed-signal validation;moment estimation;post-silicon validation;pre-silicon validation;probability;validation time","","2","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two types of flash memory cells are available for building SSD caches, single-level cells (SLC) and multi-level cells (MLC). MLC is more appealing than SLC because it can achieve higher cache capacity at the same cost. However, we see a critical issue for SSD caches to adopt MLC NAND flash: the endurance of modern MLC NAND flash is too low to sustain datacenter workloads. In this paper, we propose DuraCache that addresses the durability issue of SSD caches. DuraCache exploits the fact that SSD caches are write-through caches in datacenters. Therefore, uncorrectable errors in SSD caches can be handled like cache misses which bring in correct data from HDD arrays. In addition, DuraCache gradually allocates more ECC parities associated with data when NAND flash reaches wearout thresholds. This allows SSD caches to continue operating by sacrificing available capacity. We conduct empirical experiments and demonstrate that DuraCache enables MLC SSD caches to achieve 4.1 years of service life assuming a TPC-C workload.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560759","Cache;Endurance;MLC;NAND flash;SSD","Arrays;Bit error rate;Error correction;Error correction codes;Flash memories;Reliability;Servers","NAND circuits;cache storage;flash memories","DuraCache;HDD arrays;MLC NAND flash;SLC;SSD cache;single-level cells","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To avoid producing an unroutable design, many placers [47] invoke global routers to get a congestion map and then move cells to reduce congestion based on this map. However, as cells move, the accuracy of the congestion map degrades, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the placer in minimizing congestions. Moreover, most global routers [8-13] ignore local congestion. If placers are guided by these routers, it may produce hard-to-route placement solutions in terms of detailed routing. This work develops a routability optimizer, called Ropt, to reduce both global and local routing congestion levels of a given placement. Based on a local-routability-aware routing model, Ropt builds a global routing instance to obtain global and local congestion information for guiding global re-placement. In addition, this work presents a new legalization scheme to preserve the global routing instance after legalization. Finally, local detailed placement further minimizes the local congestion and wirelength. For the evaluation of Ropt, we use an academic global router and a commercial router to obtain both global and detailed routing results, respectively. Experimental results reveal that Ropt can improve the routing quality (in terms of congestion, wirelength, and violation) and routing runtime of a given placement solution.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560746","Placement;detailed routing;global routing;routability optimization","Equations;Estimation;Law;Pins;Routing;Runtime","VLSI;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;network routing","Ropt;VLSI design flow;academic global router;cells;commercial router;congestion map;congestion reduction;detailed routing;global replacement;global routing congestion level;hard-to-route placement solution;legalization scheme;local routing congestion level;local-routability-aware routing model;optimization;routability optimizer;routing quality;routing runtime;wirelength","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their actual benefits are not yet clearly verified while the energy efficiency can be improved in many ways. The carbon emission benefits from EV is largely diminished if we charge EV with electricity from petroleum power plants due to power loss during generation, transmission, conversion and charging. On the other hand, regenerative braking is direct power conversion from the wheel to battery and one of the most important processes that can enhance energy efficiency of EV. Power loss during regenerative braking can be reduced by hybrid energy storage system (HESS) such that super-capacitors accept high power as batteries have small rate capability. Conventional charge management does not systematically exchange charge between the supercapacitor and battery. However, asymmetry in acceleration and deceleration as well as battery charging and discharging capability make the supercapacitor state of charge (SoC) management override the efficiency optimization. Unlike previous works, we show how charge migration during idle and cruise/stopping time can be beneficial in terms of energy efficiency and cruise range. Systematic charge migration decouples SoC management and charging efficiency optimization giving a higher degree of freedom to charging efficiency optimization. We demonstrate the proposed charge migration between the supercapacitor and battery improves energy efficiency by 19.4%.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560690","Battery-supercapacitor hybrid;Charging/discharging asymmetry;Electric vehicle;Regenerative braking","Acceleration;Batteries;DC motors;Force;Supercapacitors;System-on-chip;Vehicles","battery management systems;electric vehicles;energy storage;regenerative braking;supercapacitors","battery charging;battery discharging;battery management;carbon emission;electric vehicles;energy efficiency;hybrid energy storage systems;internal combustion engine vehicles;petroleum power plants;power conversion;power loss;regenerative braking;state of charge management;super-capacitors","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution is an entirely software technique based on static workload characterization and online execution with NBTI monitoring that equalizes the expected lifetime of each processing element by regenerating aging-aware healthy kernels that respond to the specific health state of GPGPU. We demonstrate our approach on AMD Evergreen architecture where iso-throughput executions of the healthy kernels reduce NBTI-induced voltage threshold shift up to 49% (11%) compared to naïve kernel executions, with (without) architectural support for power-gating.

Due to highly dynamic and unpredictable workload of such systems, an agile run-time task allocation scheme is required. The scheme is desired to map the tasks of an incoming application at run-time onto an optimum contiguous area of the available nodes. Contiguous and unfragmented area mapping is to settle the communicating tasks in close proximity. Hence, the power dissipation, the congestion between different applications, and the latency of the system will be significantly reduced. To find an optimum region, we first propose an approximate model that quickly estimates the available area around a given node. Then the stochastic hill climbing algorithm is used as a search heuristic to find a node that has the required number of available nodes around it. Presented agile climber takes the steps using an adapted version of hill climbing algorithm named Smart Hill Climbing, SHiC, which takes the runtime status of the system into account. Finally, the application mapping is performed starting from the selected first node.

Typically, the max or min of a set of Gaussians is performed iteratively in a pair-wise fashion, wherein the result of each pair-wise max or min operation is approximated to a Gaussian by matching moments of the true result obtained using Clark's approach [1]. The approximation error in the final result is thus a function of the order in which the pairwise operations are performed. In this paper, we analyze known “run-time expensive” ordering techniques that attempt to reduce this error in the context of SSTA and SSTA driven optimization. We propose new techniques to speeding up the computation of the max/min of a set of Gaussians by special handling of prevalent “zero error” cases. Two new methods are presented using these techniques that provide more than 60% run-time savings (3X speed-up) in max/min operations. This translates to an overall run-time improvement of 2-17% for a single SSTA run and an improvement of up to 8 hours (55%) in an SSTA driven optimization run.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560775","Statistical timing;variability","Approximation error;Context;Gaussian distribution;Indexes;Optimization;Timing","Gaussian processes;approximation theory;error analysis;iterative methods;minimax techniques;statistical analysis;timing","Clark approach;Gaussian random variable;SSTA driven optimization;approximation error analysis;iterative method;moment matching;pair-wise max operation;pair-wise min operation;pairwise operation;prevalent zero error handling;run-time expensive ordering technique;statistical static timing analysis","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCA has emerged as a serious threat to many mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems. From an attacker's point of view, the difficulty of mounting SCA largely depends on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the side-channel information. It has been shown that SNR primarily depends on algorithmic and circuit-level implementation, measurement noise, as well as device thermal noise. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on the effect of power delivery network (PDN) on SCA resistance. We note that the PDN plays a significant role in SNR of measured supply current. Furthermore, SCA resistance strongly depends on the operating frequency due to RLC structure of a power grid. In this paper, we analyze the effect of power grid on SCA and provide quantitative results to demonstrate the frequency-dependent SCA resistance due to PDN-induced noise. This property can potentially be exploited by an attacker to facilitate the attack by operating a device at favorable frequency points. On the other hand, from a designer's perspective, one can explore countermeasures to secure the device at all operating frequencies while minimizing the design overhead. Based on this observation, we propose a frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique to efficiently protect against SCA. Simulation results using realistic PDN model as well as experimental measurements using FPGA test board validate the observations on role of PDN in SCA and the efficacy of the proposed compensation approach.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560671","DPA;SCA resistance;Side-channel attack (SCA);noise injection;power delivery network","Clocks;Cryptography;Nickel;Resistance;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","compensation;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;power grids;telecommunication channels","FPGA test board;PDN model;PDN-induced noise;RLC structure;SCA resistance;SNR;circuit-level implementation;compensation approach;crypto chips;frequency-dependent SCA resistance;frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique;mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems;measurement noise;physical parameters;power delivery network;power-grid-aware secure design;secret information extraction;side channel attack;signal-to-noise ratio","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to variations that reduce circuit yield, increase susceptibility to noise, and severely degrade their anticipated energy and speed benefits. Joint exploration and optimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required to overcome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches for such exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostly rely on trial-and-error-based ad-hoc techniques.

It has been shown that the various forms of parallelism in an application should be explored to achieve the maximum system performance. However, if more parallelism is revealed than needed, it will overload the underlying MPSoC platform. At the same time, the revealed parallelism should be sufficient such that the MPSoC platform is fully utilized. Therefore, the amount of revealed and exploited parallelism has to be just-enough with respect to the platform constraints. In this paper, we study the problem of exploiting just-enough parallelism by application task unfolding, when mapping streaming applications modeled using the Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) MoC onto MPSoC platforms in hard real-time systems. We show that our problem of simultaneously unfolding and allocating tasks under hard real-time scheduling has a bounded solution space and derive its upper bounds. Subsequently, we devise an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, while the obtained solution meets a pre-specified quality. The experiments on a set of real-life streaming applications demonstrate that our algorithm results, within reasonable amount of time, in a system specification with large performance gain. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm is on average 100 times faster than one of the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, i.e., NSGA-II genetic algorithm, while achieving the same quality of solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560763","","Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Parallel processing;Real-time systems;Resource management;Upper bound;Vectors","data flow graphs;embedded systems;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","MPSoC;embedded streaming applications;exploiting just-enough parallelism;hard real-time systems;multiprocessor system-on-chip;parallel models of computation;real-life streaming applications;streaming application mapping;synchronous data flow;tasks allocation","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is, however, a very expensive proposition that requires large amounts of processing time. Instead, LEQA, which is based on computing the neighborhood population counts of qubits, can produce estimates of the circuit latency with good accuracy (i.e., an average of less than 3% error) with up to two orders of magnitude speedup for mid-size benchmarks.

Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2013 50th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20130718","2013","","","1","6","Recovery based design (RBD) is a promising approach for the design of energy-efficient circuits under variations. RBD instruments circuits with mechanisms to identify and correct timing violations, thereby allowing reduced guard bands or design margins. In addition, RBD enables aggressive voltage overscaling to a point where timing errors occur even under nominal conditions. A major barrier to the widespread adoption of RBD is that traditional design practices and synthesis tools result in circuits with so-called“path walls”, leading to an explosion in the number of timing errors beyond a certain critical operating voltage. To alleviate this effect, previous techniques focused on combinational circuit optimizations such as sizing, use of dual Vt,, cells, re-structuring, etc. to favorably reshape the path delay distribution. However, these techniques are limited by the inherent sequential structure of the circuit, which defines the boundaries of the combinational logic. In this work, we explore a completely different approach to synthesize circuits for RBD. We propose the use of retiming, a well-known and powerful sequential optimization technique to redefine the boundaries of combinational logic, thereby creating new opportunities for RBD that cannot be explored by previous techniques. We make the key observation that, in retiming circuits with RBD (unlike classical retiming), it is acceptable for a few paths in the circuit to exceed the clock period. Using this insight, we propose a synthesis methodology, Relax-and-Retire, wherein the original circuit is relaxed by ignoring timing constraints on selected paths that are bottlenecks to retiming. When classical minimum period retiming is employed on this relaxed circuit, the path wall is shifted to a lower delay, thus allowing additional voltage overscaling. The Relax-and-Retire methodology judiciously selects bottleneck paths by trading off recovery overheads caused by timing errors due to these path- with the opportunities for retiming. We utilize the proposed methodology to synthesize a wide range of benchmarks including arithmetic circuits, ISCAS89 benchmarks and modules from the UltraSPARC T1 processor. Our results demonstrate 9-25% (average of 15.3%) improvement in overall energy compared to a well-optimized baseline with RBD.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560704","Low Power Design;Recovery Based Design;Retiming","Clocks;Delays;Error analysis;Logic gates;Registers;Sequential circuits","benchmark testing;circuit optimisation;clocks;combinational circuits;digital arithmetic;logic design;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;timing circuits","ISCAS89 benchmarks;RBD;UltraSPARC T1 processor;aggressive voltage overscaling;arithmetic circuits;circuit synthesis;clock period;combinational logic;critical operating voltage;energy efficient circuit design;energy efficient recovery-based design;minimum period retiming;path delay distribution;path walls;recovery overheads;relax-and-retime methodology;relaxed circuit;retiming circuits;sequential optimization technique;timing constraints;timing errors;timing violation correction;timing violation identification","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice this means the inclusion of cryptographic algorithms of sufficient cryptographic strength. For battery operated devices or for passively powered devices, these cryptographic algorithms need highly efficient, low power, low energy realizations. Moreover, unique to cryptographic implementations is that they also need protection against physical tampering either active or passive. This means that countermeasures need to be included during the design process. Similar to design for low energy, design for physical protection needs to be addressed at all design abstraction levels. Differently, while skipping one optimization step in a design for low energy or low power, merely reduces the battery life time, skipping a countermeasure, means opening the door for a possible attack. Designing for security requires a thorough threat analysis and a balanced selection of countermeasures. This paper will discuss the different abstraction layers and design methods applied to obtain low power/low energy and at the same time side-channel and fault attack resistant cryptographic implementations. To provide a variety of security features, including location privacy, it is clear that medical devices need public key cryptography (PKC). It will be illustrated with the design of a low energy elliptic curve based public key programmable co-processor.

Therefore, this paper presents an approach which is able to find the optimal sizing of basic circuit blocks considering process variation. We utilize this approach to predict the impact of scaling in FinFET technologies and the influence of process variations in future technology nodes.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560626","FinFET;NBTI;discrete sizing;predictive modeling;process variations;standard cells","Delays;FinFETs;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Optimization;Predictive models","MOSFET;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability","CMOS technology;FinFET technology;circuit reliability;design exploration;optimal sizing;process variation;product performance prediction;standard cell evaluation;standard cell modeling;technology basic circuit blocks;technology scaling;variability source","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, several RCEs [1-4] based on global routing engines are developed, but they typically ignore the effects of routing on timing so that the identified routing paths may be overlong and thus impractical. To be aware of the timing issues, our proposed global-routing-based RCE obeys the layer directive and scenic constraints to respectively limit the routing layers and the maximum routing wirelength of the potentially timing-critical nets. To handle the scenic constrains, we propose a novel method based on a relaxation-legalization scheme. Also, because the work in [5] reveals that congestion ratio is a better indicator than overflow to evaluate routability, this work focuses on minimizing the congestion ratio rather than overflows. As will be shown, the problem of minimizing congestion ratio is more complicated than minimizing overflows, so we develop a new rip-up and rerouting scheme to reduce congestion and further to approach a target congestion ratio. Moreover, to fit the demands of practical uses, this work presents a control utility to trade off runtime and quality, which is an essential function to an industrial RCE tool. Experiments reveal that the proposed RCE is faster and more accurate than another industrial global-routing-based RCE.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560685","Congestion estimation;global routing;routability","Estimation;Generators;Routing;Runtime;Throughput;Timing","network routing;network synthesis","congestion ratio minimization;control utility;global routing engines;identified routing paths;industrial RCE tool;industrial design flow;industrial global-routing-based RCE;maximum routing wirelength;real design constraints;relaxation-legalization scheme;rip-up-rerouting scheme;routing congestion estimation","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous work in this area has demonstrated the potential for significant energy and performance improvements, but largely consists of ad hoc techniques that have been applied to a small number of applications. Taking approximate computing closer to mainstream adoption requires (i) a deeper understanding of inherent application resilience across a broader range of applications (ii) tools that can quantitatively establish the inherent resilience of an application, and (iii) methods to quickly assess the potential of various approximate computing techniques for a given application. We make two key contributions in this direction. Our primary contribution is the analysis and characterization of inherent application resilience present in a suite of 12 widely used applications from the domains of recognition, data mining, and search. Based on this analysis, we present several new insights into the nature of resilience and its relationship to various key application characteristics. To facilitate our analysis, we propose a systematic framework for Application Resilience Characterization (ARC) that (a) partitions an application into resilient and sensitive parts and (b) characterizes the resilient parts using approximation models that abstract a wide range of approximate computing techniques. We believe that the key insights that we present can help shape further research in the area of approximate computing, while automatic resilience characterization frameworks such as ARC can greatly aid designers in the adoption approximate computing.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560706","Approximate Computing;Inherent Application Resilience;Resilience Characterization","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Hardware;Kernel;Measurement;Resilience","data mining;hardware-software codesign","ARC;application resilience characterization;approximate computing;data mining;design paradigm;inherent application resilience","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major advantage of our approach is a direct and concurrent charge transfer between each cell of the EES using inductors. To enable a system-level modeling and performance analysis of the architecture, a detailed investigation of the components and their interaction with the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control was performed at transistor-level. At system-level, we propose a control algorithm for the charge transfer that aims at minimizing the energy loss and balancing time.

Much of this has been motivated by the inherently resource-constrained nature of embedded devices that mandates efficiency as the primary design principle. In this paper, we advocate a change in the way we see and treat embedded systems. Not only have embedded systems become much more powerful and resources more affordable, we also see a trend towards making embedded devices more consumable, programmable, and customizable by end users. In fact, we see a strong similarity with recent developments in cloud computing. We outline several challenges and opportunities in turning a language runtime system like the Java Virtual Machine into a cloud platform. We focus in particular on support for running multiple tenants concurrently within the platform. Multi-tenant support is essential for efficient resource utilization in cloud environments but can also improve application performance and overall user experience in embedded environments. We believe that today's modern language runtimes, with extensions to support multi-tenancy, can form the basis for a single continuous platform for emerging embedded applications backed by cloud-based service infrastructures.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560668","Cloud Computing;Embedded Systems;Platform as a Service","Benchmark testing;Embedded systems;Hardware;Java;Runtime;Servers;Virtual machining","Java;cloud computing;embedded systems;instruction sets;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ISA;Java virtual machine;cloud computing platform;cloud-based service infrastructure;embedded system;instruction set architecture;language runtime system;multitenant support;operating system;primary design principle;resource-constrained utilization;user experience","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A general trend in IWMDs is towards increased functional complexity, software programmability, and connectivity to body area networks (BANs). However, as medical devices become more “intelligent,” they also become less trustworthy - less reliable and more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Various shortcomings - hardware failures, software errors, wireless attacks, malware and software exploits, and side-channel attacks - could undermine the trustworthiness of IWMDs and BANs. The trustworthiness of IWMDs must be addressed aggressively and proactively due to the potential for catastrophic consequences. While some recent efforts address the defense of IWMDs against specific security attacks, a holistic strategy that considers all concerns and types of threats is required. This paper discusses trustworthiness concerns in IWMDs and BANs through a comprehensive identification and analysis of potential threats and, for each threat, provides a discussion of the merits and inadequacies of current solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560607","Design;Reliability;Security","Biomedical monitoring;Communication system security;Cryptography;Hardware;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical communication;body area networks;invasive software;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;prosthetics;trusted computing","BAN;IWMD;body area network;catastrophic consequence;functional complexity;hardware failure;implantable medical device;malicious attack;malware;medical condition diagnosis;medical condition monitoring;medical condition treatment;security attack;side-channel attack;software error;software exploit;software programmability;trustworthy medical device;wearable medical device;wireless attack","","1","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply REC to several DSP primitives such as the FFT and FIR filter blocks, and show that this approach delivers 2-3 orders of magnitude lower (expected) error and more than an order of magnitude lesser Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) loss (in dB) over the previously proposed inexact design techniques, while yielding similar energy gains.

It has promoted the use of multi-core, multiprocessor, and distributed platforms. Such systems usually require run-time migration of distributed applications between the different nodes of the platform in order to balance the workload or to tolerate faults. Before an application can be migrated, it needs to be brought to a stable state such that restarting the application after migration does not violate its functional correctness. An application in a stable state does not change its context any further, and therefore, stabilization is a prerequisite for any application migration. Process networks are a common model of computation for specifying distributed applications. However, most results on the migration of process networks do not provide an algorithm to put a general process network into a stable state, suitable for migration. This paper proposes a technique which efficiently and correctly brings a process network executing on a distributed system to a known stable state. The correctness of the technique is independent of the temporal characteristics of the system and the topology of the process network. The required modifications of a process network are lightweight and preserve its original functionality. A model characterizing the timing properties of the technique is provided. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach and the respective model are validated with experimental results on Intel's SCC platform.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560760","","Context;Earth Observing System;Ports (Computers);Tiles;Timing;Upper bound","embedded systems;microprocessor chips","Intel SCC;distributed platforms;distributed stable states;distributed system;embedded systems;general process network;multicore platforms;multiprocessor platforms;process networks;technology scaling","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For electric vehicles, software functions play an essential role, replacing hydraulic and mechanic control systems. While model-based software development and verification are already used extensively in the automotive domain, their importance significantly increases in electric vehicles as safety-critical functions might no longer rely on mechanical (fall-back) solutions. The need for reducing costs, size, and weight in electric vehicles has also resulted in a considerable interest in topics such as the consolidation of ECUs as well as efficient implementation of control software. In this paper we discuss two broad issues related to model-based software development and verification in electric vehicles. The first is concerned with how to ensure that model-level semantics are preserved in an implementation, which has important implications on the verification and certification of control software.

We develop a scalable algorithm to perform timing-driven routing under these extra constraints. We also enhance the placement algorithm to recover logic blocks which become virtually unusable due to shorted pins.

Although the power-efficiency of CGRAs can be very high, their performance critically hinges upon the capabilities of the compiler. This is because a CGRA compiler has to perform explicit pipelining, scheduling, placement, and routing of operations. Existing CGRA compilers struggle with two main problems: 1) effectively utilizing the local register files in the PEs, and 2) high compilation times. This paper significantly improves the state-of-the-art in CGRA compilers by first creating a precise and general formulation of the problem of loop mapping on CGRAs, considering the local registers, and from the insights gained from the problem formulation, distilling an efficient and constructive heuristic solution. We show that the mapping problem, once characterized, can be reduced to the problem of finding maximal weighted clique in the product graph of the time-extended CGRA and the data dependence graph of the kernel. The heuristic we've developed results in average of 1.89 X better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when applied to several kernels from multimedia and SPEC2006 benchmarks. A unique feature of our heuristic is that it learns from failed attempts and constructively changes the schedule to achieve better mappings at lower compilation times.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560611","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Kernel;Registers;Resource management;Routing;Schedules","","","","3","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome the issue of limited cache space per task, we keep a portion of the cache unlocked and let all the tasks use it through time-multiplexing. Compared to locking the entire cache for each task during execution, our approach obviates the cost of reloading locked blocks at preemption. But we require static cache analysis for WCET estimation and cache related preemption delay (CRPD) analysis of the unlocked cache space.

Burn-in for screening latent defects during manufacturing is expensive and its effectiveness for new TSV defect types has yet to be thoroughly characterized. We describe a reconfigurable in-field repair solution that is able to effectively tolerate latent TSV defects through the judicious use of spares.

The well known double-error-correcting BCH codes and the classical decoding method for BCH codes based on Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and Chien search cannot be directly adopted to replace SEC-DED codes because of their much larger decoding latency. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical double-error-correcting (HDEC) code. The construction methods and the decoder architecture for the codes are described. The presented error correcting algorithm takes only 1 clock cycle to finish if no error or a single-bit error occurs. When there are multi-bit errors, the decoding latency is O(log<sub>2</sub>m) clock cycles for codes defined over GF(2<sup>m</sup>).

This algorithm combines a static mapping strategy based on workload scenarios and a dynamic mapping strategy to achieve an overall improvement of system efficiency. We evaluated our algorithm using a homogeneous MPSoC system with three real applications.

Prior work uses strict network isolation to fulfill performance isolation. However, strict network isolation either results in low consolidation density, or complex routing mechanisms which indicates prohibitive high hardware cost and large latency. In view of this limitation, we propose a novel NoC isolation strategy for many-core cloud processors, called relaxed isolation (RISO). It permits underutilized links to be shared by multiple applications, at the same time keeps the aggregated traffic in check to enforce performance isolation. The experimental results show that the consolidation density is improved more than 12% in comparison with previous strict isolation scheme, meanwhile reducing network latency by 38.4% on average.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560631","Cloud Computing;Cloud Processors;Networks-on-Chip;Performance Isolation;Relaxed Isolation;Workload Consolidation","Network topology;Program processors;Routing;Shape;System-on-chip;Topology;Vectors","cloud computing;electronic engineering computing;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC isolation strategy;RISO;aggregated traffic;cloud service providers;complex routing mechanisms;low consolidation density;many-core cloud processors;many-core resources;relaxed network-on-chip isolation;scale-out workloads;system utilization optimization;workload consolidation technique","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, test engineers are often reluctant to adopt alternative tests since it is not guaranteed that test cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of sacrificing test quality. In this paper, we present a technique to estimate the parametric test error fast and reliably with parts per million accuracy. The technique is based on extreme value theory and statistical blockade.

The conventional approaches for processor voltage and frequency adjustment are not suitable for streaming multimedia applications due to the cyclic nature of dependencies in the executing tasks which can potentially violate the throughput constraints. In this paper, we propose a methodology that applies DVFS for such cyclic dependent tasks. The methodology involves an off-line analysis that assumes worst-case execution times of tasks to identify the executions that can be slowed down and an on-line analysis to utilize the slacks arising from tasks that finish their execution before the worst-case execution times. Thus, the methodology minimizes energy consumption during both off-line and on-line analysis while satisfying the throughput constraints. Experiments based on models of real-life streaming multimedia applications show that the proposed methodology reduces the overall energy consumption by 43% when compared to existing approaches.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560708","Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip;energy consumption;streaming applications;throughput constraint","Algorithm design and analysis;Decoding;Energy consumption;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Throughput;Tiles","electronic engineering computing;energy conservation;energy consumption;media streaming;multimedia systems;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;system-on-chip","DVFS;MPSoC;cyclic dependent task;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy optimization;execution slacks;frequency adjustment;multiprocessor systems-on-chip;off-line analysis;online analysis;processor voltage;real-life streaming multimedia application;throughput constraint;worst-case execution time","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These tools, and the abstractions they are based on, were originally intended to handle designs of millions of gates or less. They are not up to the task of handling today's billion-gate designs. The result is months of delay and considerable labor from final RTL to tapeout. Surprises in timing closure, global congestion, and power consumption are common. Even taking an existing design to a new process node is a time-consuming and laborious process. Twenty-first century CAD tools should be based on higher-level abstractions to enable billion-gate chips to go from final RTL to tapeout in days, not months. Key to attaining this increase in productivity is raising the level of design and using simple, standard interfaces. Designs should be composed from high-level modules - processors, MODEMs, CODECs, memory subsystems, and I/O subsystems - rather than gates and flip-flops. Each module, which we expect to contain 100 thousand to 10 million gates, is easily laid out by today's tools, is placed as a unit, and communicates over a NoC via a standard interface. Restricting modules to standard sizes and aspect ratios further simplifies physical design. We expect even a large chip to contain at most a few thousand such modules and expect the physical design and chip-assembly to take a few days with minimal labor after completion of the module-level design.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560687","Chiplet;Design automation;Digital design;Modularity;NoC","Logic gates;Standards;Synchronization;System-on-chip;Tiles;Wiring","circuit CAD;network-on-chip","NoC;RTL;aspect ratio;billion-gate designs;chip-assembly;codec;digital design tools;flip-flops;high-level modules;memory subsystems;modem;module-level design;power consumption;processors;twenty-first century CAD tools","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the sensitivity of the MBC programming to the process variations and input signal noise. We then proposed a noise-eliminating training method on top of a new crossbar structure to minimize the noise accumulation during the MBC training and improve the trained system performance, i.e.,the pattern recall rate. A digital-assisted initialization step for MBC training is also introduced to reduce the training failure rate as well as the training time. Experimental results show that our noise-eliminating training method can improve the pattern recall rate. For the tested patterns with 128 × 128 pixels our technique can reduce the MBC training time by 12.6% ~ 14.1% for the same pattern recognition rate, or improve the pattern recall rate by 18.7% ~ 36.2% for the same training time.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560600","Memristor;Neuromorphic Computing;Pattern recogniton","Abstracts;Engines;Lead;Memristors;Registers;Training","analogue integrated circuits;computer based training;computerised monitoring;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;interference suppression;matrix multiplication;memristors;neural chips","MBC programming;MBC structure;MBC training time;analog matrix-vector multiplication;digital-assisted initialization step;digital-assisted noise-eliminating training;human-brain;input signal noise;memristor crossbar-based analog neuromorphic computing engine;memristor technology;memristor-based crossbar structure;neuromorphic computing architecture;neuromorphic computing system design;noise accumulation;noise-eliminating training method;pattern recall rate;pattern recognition rate;process variation;real-time monitoring;trained system performance;training failure rate","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A majority of existing PUFs rely on a dedicated circuit structure for generating chip-specific signatures, which often imposes concerns due to area/power overhead and extra design efforts. Furthermore, existing PUF-based signature generation cannot be employed to authenticate chips already in the market. In this paper, we propose RESP, a novel PUF structure realized in embedded SRAM array, a prevalent component in processors and system-on-chips (SOCs), with virtually no design modification. RESP leverages on voltage-depend memory access failures (during write) to produce large volume of high-quality challenge-response pairs. Since many modern ICs integrate SRAM array of varying size with isolated power grid, RESP can be easily retrofitted into these chips. Circuit-level simulation of 1000 chips using realistic process variation model shows high uniqueness of 49.2% average inter-die Hamming distance and good reproducibility of 2.88% intra-die Hamming distance under temperature <; 85°C. The device aging effect, e.g. bias temperature instability (BTI), results in only 4.95% estimated unstable bits for ten-year usage.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560653","BTI;Hardware security;PUF;SRAM;Signature","Arrays;Robustness;SRAM cells;System-on-chip;Voltage control","SRAM chips;maintenance engineering;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip","RESP;circuit-level simulation;embedded SRAM array;hardware security;processors;retrofitting;robust physical unclonable function;system-on-chips","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how stochastic circuits can be integrated at the pixel level with image sensors, thus supporting efficient real-time (pre)processing of images. We present the design of several representative circuits, which demonstrate that stochastic designs can be significantly smaller, faster, more power-efficient, and more noise-tolerant than conventional ones. Furthermore, the stochastic designs naturally produce images with progressive quality improvement.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560729","Emerging Technologies;Image Processing;Real-Time Computing;Stochastic Computing;Vision Chips","Clocks;Image edge detection;Noise;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Tin","feature extraction;image processing;image sensors;network synthesis;stochastic processes","feature extraction;image sensors;image-processing circuits design;real-time image-processing;retinal implants;stochastic circuits;stochastic computing techniques;stochastic designs;vision restoration","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current-flow constraints are specified to the critical nets with monotonic current/signal paths to reduce parasitic impacts. The current-density constraints are usually specified on the nets with variable wire widths to avoid the IR-drop and electromigration problems. In this paper, we propose the first work to simultaneously consider current-flow and current-density constraints while placing and routing the analog circuits with minimized chip area, routed wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise at the same time. We first present an enhanced B*-tree representation to simultaneously model modules and interconnects for an analog circuit. Then a simultaneous placement and routing algorithm is presented to generate a layout while satisfying the current-flow and current-density constraints with minimized chip area, routed wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain better layout results and satisfy all specified constraints while optimizing circuit performance.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560598","Analog ICs;Physical Design;Placement;Routing","Analog circuits;Couplings;Integrated circuit interconnections;Layout;Resource management;Routing;Wires","analogue integrated circuits;electromigration;network routing","B*-tree representation;IR-drop;analog layout synthesis placement;analog layout synthesis routing;bend number;chip area;coupling noise;current density constraint;current flow constraint;electromigration problem;monotonic current-signal path;parasitic impacts;routed wirelength;via counts","","0","1","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, conventional rule-based and model-based OPCs encounter severe difficulties at advanced technology nodes. Inverse Lithography Technique (ILT) that solves the inverse problem of the imaging system becomes a promising solution for OPC. In this paper, we consider simultaneously 1) the design target optimization under nominal process condition and 2) process window minimization with different process corners, and solve the mask optimization problem based on ILT. The proposed method is tested on 32nm designs released by IBM for the ICCAD 2013 contest. Our optimization is implemented in two modes, MOSAIC_fast and MOSAIC_exact, which outperform the first place winner of the ICCAD 2013 contest by 7% and 11%, respectively.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881379","","Abstracts;Diffraction;Lithography;Minimization;Optical diffraction;Optical harmonic generation;Optical imaging","inverse problems;masks;minimisation;nanolithography;proximity effect (lithography)","EPE minimization;ILT;MOSAIC_exact mode;MOSAIC_fast mode;OPC;design target optimization;edge placement error minimization;inverse lithography technique;inverse problem;mask optimization;nanolithography;optical proximity correction;process window aware inverse correction;process window minimization;resolution enhancement;size 32 nm","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over 17,000 participants registered for this MOOC. This paper summarizes my experience with teaching EDA at planetary scale: how we covered ASIC synthesis, verification, layout, and timing; how we built cloud resources to enable students to experiment with open-source tools; how we designed software projects and deployed cloud-based auto-graders to support realistic EDA tool projects.

"A red team/blue team assessment of functional analysis methods for malicious circuit identification","Waksman, A.; Rajendran, J.; Suozzo, M.; Sethumadhavan, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20140821","2014","","","1","4","Recent advances in hardware security have led to the development of FANCI (Functional Analysis for Nearly-Unused Circuit Identification), an analysis algorithm that identifies stealthy, malicious circuits within hardware designs that can perform backdoor operations to compromise security. Evaluations of such methods using benchmarks and academically known attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test the abilities of the FANCI prototype. In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups from multiple continents created designs with backdoors hidden in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are non-stealthy backdoors, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some areas where the FANCI prototype could be made more performant, which motivates further development of the prototype.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881502","backdoors;functional analysis;hardware;intellectual property;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Logic gates;Prototypes;Security;Testing;Wires","functional analysis;logic design","FANCI;blue team assessment;dynamic attack scenarios;frequent-action backdoors;functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification;functional analysis methods;hardware designs;malicious circuit identification;non-stealthy backdoors;red team assessment","","0","","","","","1-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
