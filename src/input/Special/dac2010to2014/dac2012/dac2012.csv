"A new uncertainty budgeting based method for robust analog/mixed-signal design","Jin Sun; Gupta, P.; Roveda, J.","Orora Design Technol., Inc., Issaquah, WA, USA","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2012 49th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20120719","2012","","","529","535","This paper proposes a novel methodology for robust analog/mixed-signal IC design by introducing a notion of budget of uncertainty. This method employs a new conic uncertainty model to capture process variability and describes variability-affected circuit design as a set-based robust optimization problem. For a pre-specified yield requirement, the proposed method conducts uncertainty budgeting by associating performance yield with the size of uncertainty set for process variations. Hence the uncertainty budgeting problem can be further translated into a tractable robust optimization problem. Compared with the existing robust design flow based on ellipsoid model, this method is able to produce more reliable design solutions by allowing varying size of conic uncertainty set at different design points. In addition, the proposed method addresses the limitation that the size of ellipsoid model is calculated solely relying on the distribution of process parameters, while neglecting the dependence of circuit performance upon these design parameters. The proposed robust design framework has been verified on various analog/mixed-signal circuits to demonstrate its efficiency against ellipsoid model. An up to 24% reduction of design cost has been achieved by using the uncertainty budgeting based method.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241557","Budget of Uncertainty;Performance Yield;Process Variations;Robust Design;Uncertainty Set","Circuit optimization;Ellipsoids;Integrated circuit modeling;Robustness;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit yield;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","conic uncertainty model;conic uncertainty set;design cost reduction;design solution reliability;ellipsoid model;performance yield;process parameter distribution;process variability;robust analog-mixed-signal IC design;robust design framework;set-based robust optimization problem;uncertainty budgeting;variability-affected circuit design","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Recovery-based design for variation-tolerant SoCs","Kozhikkottu, V.; Dey, S.; Raghunathan, A.","","Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2012 49th ACM/EDAC/IEEE","20120719","2012","","","826","833","Parameter variations have emerged as a significant threat to continued CMOS scaling in the nanometer regime. Due to increasing performance penalties associated with worst-case design, recovery based design has emerged as a promising approach for dealing with the impact of variations. Previous work has applied recovery based design at the circuit and micro-architecture levels of abstraction. In this work, we address the problem of designing variation-tolerant SoCs using the recovery based design paradigm. We demonstrate that a monolithic implementation of recovery based design fails to scale for large SoCs. We propose the concept of recovery islands, wherein each island consists of one or more SoC components that can recover independent of the rest of the SoC, and demonstrate how our proposal can be easily realized via minor changes to a traditional SoC design flow. We study the tradeoffs involved in applying recovery based design at the system level. We demonstrate that it is critical to account for (i) the inherent diversity of the error-voltage profiles among various components in an SoC, and (ii) the impact of error recovery in a component on overall system performance. We then propose a systematic recovery-based SoC design methodology that partitions a given SoC into recovery islands and also computes the optimal operating points for each island, taking into account the various system level trade-offs involved. We evaluate our framework on three different SoC designs, an 802.11b MAC processor, an MPEG encoder and a Wireless Video Capture system and demonstrate an average of 32% energy savings over conventional designs.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241601","Low Power Design;System-on-chip;Variation Aware Design;Variation Tolerance","Clocks;Delay;Error analysis;System performance;System-on-a-chip;Voltage control","integrated circuit design;recovery;system-on-chip","802.11b MAC processor;CMOS scaling;MPEG encoder;SoC components;error recovery impact;error-voltage profiles;parameter variations;recovery islands;systematic recovery-based SoC design methodology;variation-tolerant SoC design;wireless video capture system;worst-case design","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This poses a tremendous challenge on how to print and manufacture these ever-shrinking physical components that make up the transistors and the interconnect - generation after process generation. One aspect of this challenge is that the process rules are exploding in complexity - directly translating into physical design EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool complexity. Traditional design rules governed the spacing, overlap or alignment of any two layout objects from this set: diffusion, poly, via cut, wire, etc. In this work we propose a solution that relies on grids (aka. Fabrics), models the design rules on those grids and presents them to the EDA tools in such a way that it minimizes the complexity cost on the tools' side. In an ideal situation, the proposed solution can completely decouple the tools from the process rules, i.e. even if the tools don't change at all, they'll still be able to support new process nodes.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241548","API;Abstraction;Design rules;Fabrics;Grids","Fabrics;Layout;Payloads;Routing;Solid modeling;Wires","circuit complexity;electronic design automation;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;network routing;vias","Moore's law;complexity cost minimization;design fabrics;design rules;electronic design automation tool;grid-based model;interconnect generation;layout objects alignment;layout objects overlap;layout objects spacing;physical design EDA tool complexity;process generation;process rules;rule agnostic routing","","1","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though electronics has the advantage in raw speed, biological systems have the edge in many other areas. They can be produced, and indeed self-reproduce, without expensive and finicky factories. They are tolerant of manufacturing defects, and learn and adapt for better performance. In many cases they can self-repair damage. These advantages suggest that biological systems might be useful in a wide variety of tasks involving information processing. So far, all attempts to use the nervous system of a living organism for information processing have involved selective breeding of existing organisms. This approach, largely independent of the details of internal operation, is used since we do not yet understand how neural systems work, nor exactly how they are constructed. However, as our knowledge increases, the day will come when we can envision useful nervous systems and design them based upon what we want them to do, as opposed to variations on what has been already built. We will then need tools, corresponding to our Electronic Design Automation tools, to help with the design.

In order to fulfill the requirements of the specific scenario, a WSN must provide the right tradeoff between performance and lifetime, which is heavily determined by the network design. However, although the complexity of WSNs is increasing, the design space exploration is often carried out manually without the support of a general analytical methodology. In this paper, we advocate a model-based approach as an efficient and scalable way to explore the energy-performance tradeoffs during the design. In particular, we show that it is possible to define systemlevel models to describe wide classes of WSNs, providing a quick and accurate network evaluation. As a proof of concept, we propose a general model that describes the main characteristics of a class of WSNs for human health monitoring, and we apply it to a real case study. The results show that the energy-performance estimation error of the model never exceeds 1.74% compared to real data, while the evaluation time is reduced by up to 6 orders of magnitude with respect to an accurate network simulation.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241633","Cross-layer design;Model-based design;System-level modeling;Wireless body sensor networks;Wireless sensor networks","Delay;Discrete wavelet transforms;Energy consumption;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical communication;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks","WSN;design exploration;design space exploration;energy-performance estimation error;energy-performance trade-offs;energy-performance tradeoffs;general analytical methodology;human health monitoring;model-based approach;network design;network evaluation;wireless sensor networks","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is reported that one third of this overhead is due to the resource-intensive task of manual debugging. To relieve this burden, this work introduces the novel concept of path directed debugging within a window-based abstraction/refinement framework. The algorithm divides the error trace into non-overlapping time-windows where each window is analyzed separately. Subsequent windows are replaced with abstracted over-approximations derived from failing paths in the time domain. Using this abstracted model, each solution found is processed through an additional verification step that removes spurious solutions and simultaneously refines the problem. This paper also develops the theory that shows that the proposed approach is complete, a fact that mitigates the incompleteness inherent in past time-window based debugging methods. Experimental results on industrial designs with long error traces show a 55% decrease in peak memory usage resulting in 78% more instances being solved when compared to previous work.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241618","debug;diagnosis","Abstracts;Algorithm design and analysis;Concrete;Debugging;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model","computability;electronic design automation;formal verification;program debugging","SAT-based design debugging;abstracted over-approximations;industrial designs;manual debugging;nonoverlapping time-windows;path directed abstraction;path directed debugging;path directed refinement;peak memory usage;resource-intensive task;time-window based debugging methods;window-based abstraction framework;window-based refinement framework","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number of control pins used to drive electrodes is a major contributor to fabrication cost for disposable biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration.

It is necessary to consider routing obstacles for modern flip-chip designs, where the obstacles could be regions blocked for signal integrity protection (especially for analog/mixed-signal modules), pre-routed or power/ground nets, and even for through-silicon vias for 3D IC designs. However, no existing published works consider obstacles. To remedy this insufficiency, this paper presents the first work to solve the free-assignment flip-chip routing problem considering obstacles. For the free-assignment routing problem, most existing works apply the network-flow formulation. Nevertheless, we observe that no existing network-flow model can exactly capture the routability of a local routing region (tile) in presence of obstacles. This paper presents the first work that can precisely model the routability of a tile, even with obstacles. Based on this new model, a two-stage approach of global routing followed by detailed routing is proposed. The global routing computes a routing topology by the minimum-cost maximum-flow algorithm, and the detailed routing determines the precise wire positions. Dynamic programming is applied to further merge tiles to reduce the problem size. Compared to a state-of-the-art flow model with obstacle handling extensions, experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve 100% routability for all circuits while the extensions of the previous work cannot complete routing for any benchmark circuit with obstacles.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241640","Flip-chip routing;Free-assignment;Obstacle-avoiding;Physical design","Computational modeling;Integrated circuits;Merging;Routing;Tiles;Wires;Wiring","dynamic programming;electronic engineering computing;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging;network routing;network topology;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC design;I/O counts;IC design;dynamic programming;flip-chip design;flip-chip packaging;free-assignment flip-chip routing problem;global routing;local routing region;minimum-cost maximum-flow algorithm;network-flow formulation;obstacle-avoiding free-assignment routing;pre-routed nets;routing topology;signal integrity protection;through-silicon vias;tile routability;two-stage approach","","1","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, much smaller distances between the CMPcores enhance the reachability of buses, revitalizing the applicability of snooping protocols for cache-to-cache transfers. In this work, we propose a hybrid NoC design to provide optimized support for cache coherency. In our design, on-chip links can be dynamically configured as either point-to-point links between NoC nodes or short buses to facilitate localized snooping.

In this paper, we propose a decoupling capacitor design strategy to reduce area overhead. The strategy consists of two parts: 1) enhancing gate capacitance through circuit optimizations and 2) using remote decoupling capacitors. Remote decoupling capacitors, which can be placed far from the block to compensate, can minimize the area overhead of the capacitance-enhancing optimizations. They also exploit less utilizable silicon area. The proposed strategy improves the capacitance density by 6.1× without extra process steps, compared to the conventional approach.

However, required accuracy varies according to applications, and 100% accurate results are still required in some situations. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-configurable approximate (ACA) adder for which the accuracy of results is configurable during runtime. Because of its configurability, the ACA adder can adaptively operate in both approximate (inaccurate) mode and accurate mode. The proposed adder can achieve significant throughput improvement and total power reduction over conventional adder designs. It can be used in accuracy-configurable applications, and improves the achievable tradeoff between performance/power and quality.

The carry-skip adder, which is designed to reduce the time needed to propagate the carry by skipping over groups of consecutive adder stages, is known to be comparable in speed to the carry look-ahead technique while it uses less logic area and less power. Nevertheless, only recently has it become popular, mainly because of its high synthesis complexity and complicated timing analysis, especially false path analysis. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic and systematic synthesis of (true) timing minimal carry-skip adder in the context of the whole design containing the adder. Precisely, unlike the previous works which invariably assume a uniform or a fixed pattern of input arrival times, thus limiting their application to the optimization of an isolated single addition or additions in specific design structures, e.g., final addition in a parallel multiplier, our synthesis algorithm allows to accept any arbitrary, but known in advance, bit-level arrival times of the addends and generates a structure of carry-skip adder that leads to minimize the timing of the whole design. We formulate the carry group (or block) partitioning problem for minimal timing into a dynamic programming problem and solved it effectively. The experimental results with various arithmetic designs show that our synthesis algorithm is able to reduce the circuit timing by up to 16% and 10%, compared with the results produced by the conventional optimal algorithm in [1], which does not support the variation of input times and the algorithm in [2], which nearly optimally supports only a specific pattern of input time variation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is very fast, taking only 2 seconds in synthesizing 256-bit two-level carry-skip adder.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165063","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Partitioning algorithms","adders;dynamic programming;logic design","arithmetic designs;arithmetic operations;automatic synthesis;bit-level arrival times;block partitioning problem;carry group partitioning problem;carry look-ahead technique;design context-aware fast-carry-skip adders;dynamic programming problem;false-path analysis;logic design;synthesis algorithm;synthesis complexity;systematic synthesis;time reduction;timing analysis;timing minimal-carry-skip adder;two-level carry-skip adder","","0","","11","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It combines many attractive attributes such as nanosecond access time, high integration density, non-volatility, and good CMOS process compatibility. However, process variation continues to be a critical issue in the designs of STT-RAM and the derived spintronic logic. Besides the process-variation-induced persistent operation error, the non-persistent error that is incurred by the intrinsic thermal fluctuations of Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) devices significantly influences the spintronic circuit reliability. In this paper, we analyzed these two types of STT-RAM operation errors at both single cell and array levels. On the top of that, we quantitatively investigate the impacts of these errors on a nonvolatile spintronic flip-flop design.

However, as the process technology scales, the process variation will cause the deviation of the actual electrical behavior of memristor. Recently, researchers have observed that the probability of a single ReRAM cell switching successfully follows a function of the logarithm of the total programming time. As a result, the uncertainty of the electrical behavior results in different degrees of error rates in ReRAM-based memory. Traditional ECC (Error Correcting Code) design for conventional DRAM memory is used to detect and correct the errors in the memory system. In this paper, based on the mathematical analysis of the error patterns in memristor-based ReRAM and the study of ECC designs, we proposed to use ECC code to relax the BER (Bit Error Rate) requirement of a single memory to improve the write energy consumption and latency for both the MOS based and cross-point based memristor ReRAM designs.

With the leakage-thermal dependency, the increasing on-chip temperature in 3D designs has serious impact on IR drop due to the increased wire resistance and increased leakage current. Power/ground (P/G) TSVs can help to relieve the IR drop violation by vertically connecting the on-chip P/G networks on different layers. However, most previous work only fulfills a margin of the full potential of PG TSVs planning since the P/G grids are restricted in a uniform topology. Besides, the overlook of resistance variation and leakage current will make the results less accurate. In this paper, we present an efficient thermal-aware P/G TSVs planning algorithm based on a sensitivity model with temperature-dependent leakage current considered. The proposed method can overcome the limitation of uniform P/G grid topology and make full use of P/G TSVs planning for the optimization of P/G network by allowing short wires to connect the P/G TSVs to P/G grids in non-uniform topology. Moreover, with resistance variation and increased leakage current caused by high temperature in 3D ICs, more accurate result can be obtained. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of our approach. Results show that neglecting thermal impacts on power delivery can underestimate IR drop by about 11%. To relieve the severe IR drop violation, 51.8% more P/G TSVs are needed than the cases without thermal impacts considered. Results also show that our P/G TSV planning based on the sensitivity model can reduce max IR drop by 42.3% and reduce the number of violated nodes by 82.4%.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164995","","Planning;Sensitivity;Thermal resistance;Three dimensional displays;Through-silicon vias;Topology;Wires","","","","4","","24","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two primary DPL techniques: pitch-split double patterning (PSDP) and self-aligned double patterning (SADP), which can be implemented using a positive tone or a negative tone process. Each DPL implementation has a different impact on line space and linewidth variation, and by analyzing the impact of these different DPL options the best overall process flow can be achieved. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and optimization framework that compares the layerwise impact of different DPL choices on SRAM robustness, density, and printability. It then performs a sizing optimization that accounts for increased variability due to DPL for each layer. Experimental results based on 45nm industrial models show that using the best DPL option for each layer, along with the sizing optimization presented, we can achieve single exposure robustness together with improved DPL printability at almost no overhead (less than 0.2% increase in write energy). Specifically, cell failure probability can be further reduced by 5X as compared to the single exposure failure probability, at the cost of increasing write energy by 6.3% and write delay by 2.5%.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165048","","Capacitance;Delay;Layout;Logic gates;Metals;Random access memory;Robustness","SRAM chips;integrated circuit design;photolithography;probability","DPL technique;PSDP technique;SADP technique;SRAM density;SRAM printability;SRAM robustness;cell failure probability;design-patterning cooptimization;double-patterning lithography;industrial models;line space variation;linewidth variation;negative-tone process;optical lithography solution;pitch-split double patterning;positive-tone process;process flow;self-aligned double patterning;single-exposure failure probability;single-exposure robustness;size 32 nm;size 45 nm;sizing optimization;subsequent technology nodes;write delay;write energy","","0","","23","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, targeting cut printing difficulties and hybrid lithography with electron beam (E-Beam) and 193 nm immersion (193i) processes, we propose a novel algorithm to optimally assign cuts to 193i or E-Beam processes with proper modifications on cut distribution, in order to maximize the overall throughput.

A slew of manual design techniques for approximate computing have been proposed in recent years, but very little effort has been devoted to design automation. We propose SALSA, a Systematic methodology for Automatic Logic Synthesis of Approximate circuits. Given a golden RTL specification of a circuit and a quality constraint that defines the amount of error that may be introduced in the implementation, SALSA synthesizes an approximate version of the circuit that adheres to the pre-specified quality bounds. We make two key contributions: (i) the rigorous formulation of the problem of approximate logic synthesis, enabling the generation of circuits that are correct by construction, and (ii) mapping the problem of approximate synthesis into an equivalent traditional logic synthesis problem, thereby allowing the capabilities of existing synthesis tools to be fully utilized for approximate logic synthesis. In order to achieve these benefits, SALSA encodes the quality constraints using logic functions called Q-functions, and captures the flexibility that they engender as Approximation Don't Cares (ADCs), which are used for circuit simplification using traditional don't care based optimization techniques. We have implemented SALSA using two off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools - SIS and Synopsys Design Compiler. We automatically synthesize approximate circuits ranging from arithmetic building blocks (adders, multipliers, MAC) to entire datapaths (DCT, FIR, IIR, SAD, FFT Butterfly, Euclidean distance), demonstrating scalability and significant improvements in area (1.1X to 1.85X for tight error constraints, and 1.2X to 4.75X for relaxed error constraints) and power (1.15X to 1.75X for tight error constraints, and 1.3X to 5.25X- for relaxed error constraints).","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241596","Approximate Computing;Error Resilience;Logic Synthesis;Low Power Design","Adders;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Optimization;Resilience","logic CAD;logic circuits","Boolean equivalence;DCT;Euclidean distance;FFT butterfly;FIR;IIR;MAC;Q-functions;RTL specification;SAD;SALSA;SIS;adders;algorithmic specifications;approximate circuits;approximate computing;approximate logic synthesis;approximate synthesis;approximation don't cares;arithmetic building blocks;automatic logic synthesis;circuit simplification;datapaths;design automation;design paradigm;error resilience;logic functions;logic synthesis problem;multipliers;off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools;quality bounds;quality constraint;synopsys design compiler;systematic logic synthesis;systematic methodology;tight error constraints","","8","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Global routing is just the first phase of a router and serves the dual purpose of (i) seeding the following phases of a router and (ii) evaluating whether the current design point is routable. Lately, it has become common to use a “light mode” version of the global router, similar to today's academic routers, to quickly evaluate the routability of a given placement. This use model suffers from two primary weaknesses: (i) it does not adequately model the local routing resources, while the model is important to remove opens and shorts and eliminate DRC violations, (ii) the metrics used to represent congestion are non-intuitive and often fail to pinpoint the key issues that need to be addressed.

Recent improvements in the speed of SAT solvers make such a formulation practical for even complex standard cells. A routing tool based on our SAT formulation is currently being used to route real industrial standard cell layouts.

In this paper, we propose GDRouter, an interleaved global routing and detailed routing algorithm for the ultimate routability i.e., detailed routing routability. The newly proposed router makes the global routing aware of detailed routing routability by correctly setting global capacity to reduce the inconsistency between the two stages. The final result contains both the detailed routing guided global routing and deailed routing solutions. Fast and efficient academic global routing and detailed routing tools FastRoute [1] and RegularRoute [2] are interleaved in GDRouter. In the Initial Capacity and Routing Weight Esitmation (ICRWE) phase, the weight for each global and detailed routing grid is calculated to make GDRouter aware of pin distribution based on a Gridded Voronoi Diagram method. Then the algorithm generates initial global capacity based on both local usage and global segment usage. In particular, Spine routing is utilized to estimate local usage. And a virtual routing i.e. fast implementations of FastRoute and RegularRoute, is performed to estimate global segment usage. The initial global capacity is applied in Full Routing phase to obtain detailed routing routability i.e., number of unassigned global segment. To further improve routability, in the following Iterative Test Routing (ITR) phase, GDRouter incrementally applies the interleaved global routing and detailed routing to adjust the global capcity based on detailed routing solution. To save runtime, GDRouter quits the loop if detailed routing routability stops improving or it reaches maximum iteration. Experimental results reveal that the newly proposed algorithm is capable of enhancing detailed routing routability. In particular, GDRouter reduces number of unassigned global segments by 90% for ISPD98 [3] derived testcases and around 60% for ISPD05/06 [4, 5] derived testcases with 2.9× runtime overhead.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241568","Physical Design;Routing;VLSI CAD","Benchmark testing;Estimation;History;Metals;Pins;Routing;Runtime","computational geometry;network routing","FastRoute;GDRouter;RegularRoute;detailed routing routability;global router;gridded Voronoi diagram;initial capacity;interleaved global routing;iterative test routing;pin distribution;routing grid;routing weight esitmation;ultimate routability;virtual routing","","0","3","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Symmetry constraints are specified to route matched nets symmetrically with respect to some common axes. Topology-matching constraints are commonly imposed on critical yet asymmetry nets with the same number of bends, vias, and wirelength. Length-matching constraints are specified to route the nets which have limited resources with the same wirelength. These three constraints can reduce current mismatches and unwanted electrical effects between two critical nets. In this paper, we propose the first work to simultaneously consider the three constraints for analog routing while minimizing total wirelength, bend numbers, via counts, and coupling noise at the same time. We first present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to simultaneously consider the three constraints for analog routing, and employ effective reduction techniques to further reduce the numbers of ILP variables and constraints.

We present an algorithm to generate BTTs that either detect, or ensure the absence of, all modeled faults in a given circuit. We also present an adaptive diagnostic method to locate quantum faults. While classical circuits, even probabilistic ones, only handle ordinary probabilities, quantum circuits deal with quantum states, which have phase as an extra probabilistic parameter. The tomographic testing methods introduced previously for probabilistic circuits are unable to detect differences in phase, and therefore leave many quantum faults undetected. In contrast, we develop a design-for-test method which is specifically intended to detect faults that only affect the phase of a quantum state. We give experimental results for benchmark and random circuits which show high coverage of quantum faults by BTTs, and good resolution in the case of the adaptive diagnosis method.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164942","Probabilistic testing;design for test;fault diagnosis;quantum circuits;test generation","Circuit faults;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Quantum computing;Testing;Tomography;Vectors","benchmark testing;design for testability;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit reliability;probability;quantum gates","adaptive diagnostic method;benchmark circuits;binary tomographic tests;confidence threshold;design for test method;faulty quantum circuit detection;faulty quantum circuit diagnosis;probabilistic circuits;quantum states;random circuits","","1","","24","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this paper we address these misconceptions and we argue that they can both be overcome.

We take a modeling and language approach that provides an appropriate set of abstractions for the resiliency logic. This cleanly separates the main design behavior from the resiliency behavior, leading to ease of design. Further, as the language abstractions can be automatically synthesized into resiliency logic, our methodology can merge with existing design flows. The concerns of verifying this additional resiliency logic can be addressed by synthesizing behavioral assertions capturing correct behavior. We demonstrate the use of this methodology on four examples, with synthesis for performance and area to estimate the overhead of the additional synthesis logic.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241661","CpR-Verilog;backward error recovery","Algorithm design and analysis;Bit error rate;Checkpointing;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Radiation detectors;Semantics","checkpointing;design engineering;formal specification;hardware description languages","behavioral assertion synthesis;design technique development;general RTL designs;hardware checkpointing specification;hardware checkpointing synthesis;language abstractions;language approach;modeling approach;resiliency behavior;resiliency logic;rollback resiliency mechanism;runtime failures;synthesis logic","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To avoid data hazards and ensure timing accuracy, this technique requires the compiler to statically analyze the design model for potential data access conflicts. In this paper, we propose a compiler optimization that improves the data conflict analysis by exploiting instance isolation. The reduction in the number of conflicts increases the available parallelism and results in significantly reduced simulation time.

To deal with this problem, the multiple-supply voltage (MSV) is a technique widely applied to a design to reduce its power consumption. However, there exist several challenges in implementing Multi-Voltage designs, which includes floorplanning, level-shifter placement, and power planning [5]. Among these challenges, placement of level shifters has direct impacts on the chip area, total wirelength, and power planning. Although several works considering MSV driven floorplanning have been proposed, they do not actually place level shifters in their flows, which makes their results unrealistic. Yu et al. [19] first proposed a methodology to place level shifters during floorplanning. But, level shifters are inserted in the whitespace of a chip, which would increase wirelength of long wires and make power planning more difficult. Thus, in this paper, we first propose two ways to allocate regions for level shifters during floorplanning, and then give a two-stage approach to place these level shifters at proper locations. The experimental results reveal that the wirelength is underestimated if we do place level shifters and it can obtain smaller wirelength if we can consider level shifters during floorplanning.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164989","","Algorithm design and analysis;Delay;Planning;Rails;Resource management;Shape","VLSI;circuit layout;power consumption","MSV;VLSI design;level shifter placement;multiple-supply voltage;power consumption;power planning;voltage island-driven floorplanning","","0","","20","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols.

Furthermore, we must ensure that the deadline is met even in the presence of direct and indirect interference from other flows sharing network links on the path. To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a link-level analysis to determine the impact of a link being used by a flow, and its affect on other flows sharing the link. Our experimental results show that we can improve schedulability by about 8% and 15% over Minimum Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165004","","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Heuristic algorithms;Interference;Real time systems;Routing;Topology","network-on-chip;real-time systems","NoC;chip multiprocessor system;link level latency analysis;multiple processors;path selection;real-time communication;real-time network-on-chip;real-time traffic","","3","","15","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To preserve the design information in such a framework, this work focuses on obfuscating the global routing problem modeled as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for large industry benchmarks. Multiple transformations are introduced in a proposed framework in which the client masks the ILP instance before it is sent to the cloud. The cloud solves the masked instance and the client unmasks the generated solution. No approximations are involved in this process. The masked instance is shown to be substantially more immune to various introduced attacks. Otherwise layout statistics and even detailed connectivity information can easily be deciphered.

To overcome the inflexibility and power overhead, a new type of spare cells, metal-configurable gate-array spare cells, are considered. Therefore, in this paper, we address a new ECO problem: Timing ECO optimization using metal-configurable gate-array spare cells.

For the very large grids in modern designs, incremental verification is highly desirable, because it allows one to skip the verification of a certain section of the grid (internal nodes)and instead, verify only the rest of the grid (external nodes). We propose an efficient approach for incremental verification in the context of vectorless constraints-based grid verification, under dynamic conditions. The traditional difficulty is that the dynamic case requires iterative analysis of both the internal and external sections. This has been previously overcome for simulation purposes, but we provide the first solution for verification, through two key contributions: 1)a bound on the internal nodes' voltages is developed that eliminates the need for iterative analysis, and 2)a multi-port Norton approach is used to construct a reduced macromodel for the internal section. As a result, we demonstrate significant reductions in runtime, with speed-ups in the range of 3-8×, with negligible impact on accuracy.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241504","Power Grid;voltage drop","Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Power grids;Symmetric matrices;Upper bound;Vectors","formal verification;integrated circuit design;power grids","complex high-performance integrated circuit design;dynamic conditions;external nodes;incremental on-die power grid verification;internal node voltage bound;iterative analysis;multiport Norton approach;vectorless constraints-based grid verification","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This enables efficient simulation of large designs implemented with less-than-perfect devices and components, and also opens the door to formal verification of transistor-level designs against higher-level specifications. In particular, our automatically generated FSMs faithfully capture the behaviour of latches, flip-flops, and circuits constructed from them. Among other technical advances, we generalize an existing (binary-only) FSM-learning approach to arbitrary I/O alphabets, which empowers it to learn high-fidelity abstractions of multi-level-discretized, multi-input/multi-output systems. Our approach, when applied to correctly functioning latches and flip-flops, is able to learn compact, multi-input FSM abstractions whose predictions closely match SPICE simulations. In addition, we have also applied our technique to produce multi-level-discretized FSM representations of digital systems that nevertheless exhibit ""analogish"" traits, such as an over-clocked, error-prone D-flip-flop. For such circuits, the automatically learned FSM abstraction includes additional states that characterise ""failure modes"" of the circuit for specific input sequences (these failure modes are also confirmed by SPICE simulations).

This utilization wall forces designers to ensure that, at any point in time, large fractions of their chips are effectively dark or dim silicon, i.e., either idle or significantly underclocked. As exponentially larger fractions of a chip's transistors become dark, silicon area becomes an exponentially cheaper resource relative to power and energy consumption. This shift is driving a new class of architectural techniques that “spend” area to “buy” energy efficiency. All of these techniques seek to introduce new forms of heterogeneity into the computational stack. We envision that ultimately we will see widespread use of specialized architectures that leverage these techniques in order to attain orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency. However, many of these approaches also suffer from massive increases in complexity. As a result, we will need to look towards developing pervasively specialized architectures that insulate the hardware designer and the programmer from the underlying complexity of such systems. In this paper, I discuss four key approaches - the four horsemen - that have emerged as top contenders for thriving in the dark silicon age.

It is becoming more acceptable to view these diseases as an engineering problem, and systems engineering approaches are becoming more accepted as a means to tackle genetic diseases. In this light, we believe that logic synthesis techniques can play a very important role. Several techniques from the field of logic synthesis can be adapted to assist in the arguably huge effort of modeling and controlling such diseases. The set of genes that control a particular genetic disease can be modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM) called the Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). Important problems include (i) inferring the GRN from observed gene expression data from patients and (ii) assuming that such a GRN exists, determining the ”best” set of drugs so that the disease is ”maximally” cured. In this paper, we report initial results on the application of logic synthesis techniques that we have developed to address both these problems. In the first technique, we present Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) based approaches to infer the logical support of each gene that regulates melanoma, using gene expression data from patients of the disease. From the output of such a tool, biologists can construct targeted experiments to understand the logic functions that regulate a particular gene. The second technique assumes that the GRN is known, and uses a weighted partial Max-SAT formulation to find the set of drugs with the least side-effects, that steer the GRN state towards one that is closest to that of a healthy individual, in the context of colon cancer.

Although using on-chip switching VRs can be an alternative solution, integrating high-quality inductors and cores on the same chip has been a technical challenge. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective power delivery technique to support per-core voltage domains. Our technique is based on the observations that (i) core-to-core voltage variations are relatively small for most execution intervals when the voltages/frequencies are optimized to maximize performance under a power constraint and (ii) per-core power-gating devices augmented with small circuits can serve as low-cost VRs that can provide high efficiency in situations like (i).

In view of this, various runtime techniques have been proposed in literature to suppress power grid noise adaptively. This paper first presents various challenges in power grid designs from an industrial perspective, explains the difficulties in handling them at deign time, and then reviews various runtime techniques to adaptively suppress power supply noise, including sensor-based power gating, re-routable decaps, proactive clock frequency actuator, and PLL based clocking.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165035","","Clocks;Noise;Power supplies;Resonant frequency;Surges;Switching circuits;Transistors","VLSI;clocks;integrated circuit design;interference suppression;low-power electronics;phase locked loops;power supplies to apparatus","PLL-based clocking;VLSI designs;adaptive power grid noise suppression;design overhead;low-power designs;noise margin;noise reduction;power grid designs;power integrity;power supply noise;proactive clock frequency actuator;reroutable decaps;runtime adaptive techniques;sensor-based power gating;statistical design methodologies;voltage droop-bounce","","2","","12","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the silicon technology keeps shrinking, Iddq values and their variation increase as well. Moreover, along with rapid design scaling, defect-induced leakage currents become less significant when compared to full-chip current and also make themselves less distinguishable. Traditional Iddq methods become less effective and cause more test escapes and yield loss. Therefore, in this paper, a new test method named σ-Iddq testing is proposed and integrates (1) a variation-aware full-chip leakage estimator and (2) a clustering algorithm to classify chip without using threshold values. Experimental result shows that σ-Iddq testing achieves a higher classification accuracy in a 45 nm technology when compared to a single-threshold Iddq testing. As a result, both the process-variation and design-scaling impacts are successfully excluded and thus the defective chips can be identified intelligently.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164938","","Accuracy;Circuit faults;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Leakage current;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing","CMOS integrated circuits;data analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;leakage currents","Iddq data intelligent analysis;chip classification;clustering algorithm;defect-induced leakage currents;design-scaling impacts;process-variation;silicon technology;single-threshold σ-Iddq testing method;size 45 nm;variation-aware full-chip leakage estimator;very deep-submicron CMOS technology","","3","","16","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many previous works tried to utilize as more MBFFs with larger bit numbers as possible to gain more clock power saving. However, an MBFF with a larger bit number may lead to serious crosstalk due to the close interconnecting wires belonging to different signal nets which are connected to the same MBFF. To address the problem, this paper analyzes, evaluates, and compares the relationship between power consumption and crosstalk when applying MBFFs with different bit numbers. To solve the addressed problem, a novel crosstalk-aware power optimization approach is further proposed to optimize power consumption while satisfying the crosstalk constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is very effective in crosstalk avoidance when applying MBFFs for power optimization. To our best knowledge, this is also the first work in the literature that considers the crosstalk effect for the MBFF application.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164987","","Capacitance;Clocks;Couplings;Crosstalk;Optimization;Power demand;Routing","crosstalk;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;logic design;low-power electronics","MBFF;clock power reduction;clock power saving;close interconnecting wires;crosstalk constraint;crosstalk-aware power optimization;lower-power design technique;multibit flip-flops;nanometer IC;signal nets","","1","","26","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DRR monitors the recent referenced cache blocks' access pattern, and replicates the blocks with high reusability to appropriate L2 slices, and the replicated copies can be shared by their nearby cores. We evaluate DRR for 16-core system using splash-2 and parsec benchmarks.

In this paper, we discuss partial use of in-field programmability in control parts of circuits for post-silicon debugging processes for electrical errors and corner case logical bugs. Our method deals with RTL designs in FSMD (Finite State Machine with Datapath) by adding partially in-field programmability, called “patch logic”, in their control parts. If designs are given in high level like C-based designs, by using our high level synthesis techniques, they are first synthesized to include such in-field programmability in the control parts of the synthesized RTL automatically. With patch logic we can dynamically change the behaviors of circuits in such a way that state transition sequences as well as values of internal values are traced based on user requests. Our patch logic can also check if there is an electrical errors or not periodically. Assuming that electrical errors occur very infrequently, an error can be detected by comparing the equivalence on the results of duplicated computations. Through experiments we discuss the area, timing, and power overhead due to the patch logic and also show results on electrical error detection with duplicated computations.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164951","","High level synthesis;Information architecture;Registers;Timing","circuit complexity;finite state machines;formal verification;high level synthesis;logic design;programmable circuits;system-on-chip","FSMD;RTL designs;corner case logical bugs;design complexity;electrical error detection;finite state machine with datapath;high level designs;high level model;high level synthesis techniques;in-field programmability;patch logic;post silicon SoC development;post silicon verification;post-silicon debugging process;post-silicon patching;programmable logic;silicon programmability;state transition sequences","","0","","10","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the number of component simulators increases, the simulation performance degrades significantly due to occurrence of frequent inter-simulator communication. In this paper, to boost up the simulation speed further, we propose a novel technique, called relaxed synchronization, which uses a simulation cache at each component simulator for simulation purpose. Like an architectural cache that reduces the main memory access frequency, a simulation cache reduces the count of synchronous communication effectively between the corresponding component simulator and the simulation backplane. When a read or write request to a shared memory is made, a cache line, not a single element, is transferred to utilize the space and temporal locality for simulation. The proposed technique is based on an assumption that the application program uses a relaxed memory model. Through experiments with real-life applications, it is proved that the proposed approach improves the simulation performance by up to 330 %.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164990","","Asynchronous communication;Backplanes;Computational modeling;Kernel;Program processors;Semiconductor process modeling;Synchronization","cache storage;circuit simulation;integrated circuit design;parallel architectures;performance evaluation;shared memory systems;synchronisation;system-on-chip;virtual prototyping","MPSoC design Sungchan verification;application program;component simulators;intersimulator communication;multiprocessor system;multiprocessor system-on-chip;relaxed memory model;relaxed synchronization technique;shared memory;simulation cache;space locality;synchronous communication;temporal locality;virtual prototyping system","","1","","16","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In MPSoCs, due to contention among concurrent memory accesses from different IP cores, memory stall cycles vary significantly, ranging from 10 to 600 cycles according to our experiments. We propose a run-time mechanism that predict the memory stall cycles of an individual IP, and make the power gating decision based on the predicted memory latency and its break-even time.

Besides, the extra flexibility for allowing logic restructuring was not exploited. In this work, we develop a framework harnessing the following more flexible strategies to make the usage of spare cells for ECO timing optimization more powerful: (1) a negotiation based re-routing scheme yielding a more global view in solving resource competition arbitration; (2) an extended gate sizing operation to allow exchanges of active gates with spare gates of different function types through equivalent logic re-structuring.

Commonly, several checking techniques are deployed alongside the simulator to detect and localize each functional bug manifestation. Among these, a widespread technique entails comparing a microprocessor design's outputs with a golden model at the architectural granularity, instruction-by-instruction. However, due to exponential growth in design complexity, the performance of software-based simulation falls far short of achieving an acceptable level of coverage, which typically requires billions of simulation cycles. Hence, verification engineers rely on simulation acceleration platforms. Unfortunately, the intrinsic characteristics of these platforms make the adoption of the checking solutions mentioned above a challenging goal: for instance, the lockstep execution of a software checker together with the design's simulation is no longer feasible. To address this challenge we propose an innovative solution for instruction-by-instruction (IBI) checking tailored to acceleration platforms. We provide novel design techniques to decouple event tracing from checking by including specialized tracing logic and by adding a post-simulation checking phase. Note that simulation performance in acceleration platforms degrades when increasing the number of signals that are traced; hence, it is imperative to generate a compact summary of the information required for checking, collecting and tracing only a few bits of information per cycle.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241619","Checking;Checking on Acceleration;Simulation Acceleration","Acceleration;Hardware;Microprocessors;Registers;Software;Vectors","formal verification;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;program debugging;program diagnostics","IBI checking;acceleration platforms;architectural granularity;architectural outputs checking;design complexity;event tracing decoupling;exponential growth;functional bug manifestation;instruction-by-instruction;lockstep execution;microprocessor design;post-simulation checking phase;simulation acceleration platforms;simulation cycles;simulation-based verification;software checker;software-based simulation;specialized tracing logic;verification engineers","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software techniques suffer from a significant amount of code size overhead, and hence, negative impact on performance and energy consumption. On the other hand, hardware-based techniques have a significant amount of hardware and area cost. In this research we exploit the available redundancies in the pipeline. The branch target buffer stores target addresses of taken branches, and ALU generates target addresses using the low-order branch displacement bits of branch instructions.

For system-wide optimization, energy and computational resources are often the two most critical limitations. Modeling energy-states of each hardware component and time spent in each state is needed for accurate energy and performance prediction. Tracking software execution in a realistic operating environment with properly modeled input/output is key to accurate prediction. However, the conventional approaches can have difficulties in practice. First, for a complex system such as an Android smartphone, building a cycle-accurate simulation environment is no easy task. Secondly, for I/O-intensive applications, a slow simulation would significantly alter the application behavior and change its performance profile. Thirdly, conventional software profiling tools generally do not work on simulators, which makes it difficult for performance analysis of complicated software, e.g., Java applications executed by the Dalvik virtual machine. Recently, virtual machine technologies are widely used to emulate a variety of computer systems. While virtual machines do not model the hardware components in the emulated system, we can ease the effort of building a simulation environment by leveraging the infrastructure of virtual machines and adding performance and power models. Moreover, multiple sets of the performance and energy models can be selectively used to verify if the speed of the simulated system impacts the software behavior. Finally, performance monitoring facilities can be integrated to work with profiling tools. We believe this approach should help overcome the aforementioned difficulties.

At the heart of this transformation is the Utilization Wall, which states that, with each new process generation, the percentage of transistors that a chip can switch at full frequency is dropping exponentially due to power constraints. This has led to increasingly larger and larger fractions of a chip's silicon area that must remain passive, or dark. Since Dark Silicon is an exponentially-worsening phenomenon, getting worse at the same rate that Moore's Law is ostensibly making process technology better, we need to seek out fundamentally new approaches to designing processors for the Dark Silicon Age. Simply tweaking existing designs is not enough. Our research attacks the Dark Silicon problem directly through a set of energy-saving accelerators, called Conservation Cores, or c-cores. C-cores are a post-multicore approach that constructively uses dark silicon to reduce the energy consumption of an application by 10× or more. To examine the utility of c-cores, we are developing GreenDroid, a multicore chip that targets the Android mobile software stack. Our mobile application processor prototype targets a 32-nm process and is comprised of hundreds of automatically generated, specialized, patchable c-cores. These cores target specific Android hotspots, including the kernel. Our preliminary results suggest that we can attain up to 11× improvement in energy efficiency using a modest amount of silicon.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164926","","Hardware;Mobile communication;Multicore processing;Program processors;Silicon;Transistors","multiprocessing systems","Android hotspots;Android mobile software stack;GreenDroid;Moore law;chip silicon area;dark silicon age;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy-saving accelerator;insane architectural design;mobile application processor prototype;multicore chip;patchable c-cores;post-multicore approach;utilization wall","","3","","7","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing works on binding minimize MUXs under given allocation by minimizing the number of inter connections, but do not care where the MUXs would be in serted in a circuit. As a result, they cannot guarantee the re quired clock frequency and often violate the clock constraint. On the contrary, our work globally optimizes binding and al location for FUs and registers while meeting the clock constraint by considering where MUXs would be inserted. Our work is formulated as an ILP problem. Also, an effective ILP-based heuristic for non-small designs is presented.

However, state-of-the-art multicore simulators either lack good extensibility due to their tightly-coupled design between functional model (FM) and timing model (TM), or cannot guarantee cycle-accuracy. This paper conducts a comprehensive study on factors affecting cycle-accuracy and uncovers several contributing factors ignored before. Based on the study, we propose a loosely-coupled functional-driven full-system simulator for multicore, namely Transformer. To ensure extensibility and cycle-accuracy, Transformer leverages an architecture-independent interface between FM and TM and uses a lightweight scheme to detect and recover from execution divergence between FM and TM. Based on Transformer, a graduate student only needs to write about 180 lines of code and takes about two months to extend an X86 functional model (QEMU) in Transformer. Moreover, the loosely-coupled design also removes the complex interaction between FM and TM and opens the opportunity to parallelize FM and TM to improve performance. Experimental results show that Transformer achieves an average of 8.4% speedup over GEMS while guaranteeing the cycle-accuracy. A further parallelization between FM and TM leads to 35.3% speedup.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241497","Extension;Full-system;Functional-driven;Multicore simulation","Analytical models;Frequency modulation;Instruction sets;Multicore processing;Pipelines;Registers;Timing","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;performance evaluation","FM;GEMS;QEMU;TM;Transformer;X86 functional model;architecture-independent interface;execution divergence;functional driven cycle accurate multicore simulator;lightweight scheme;loosely coupled functional driven full system simulator;parallelization;timing model","","2","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary question facing OS designers over the next ten years will be: What is the correct design of OS services that will scale up to hundreds or thousands of cores, and adapt to the unprecedented variability in demand of the system resources? A fundamental research challenge addressed in this paper is to identify some characteristics of such a scalable OS service for next multicore and cloud computing chips. We argue that the OS services have to deploy elastic techniques to adapt to this variability at runtime. In this paper, we advocate for elastic OS service, illustrate their feasibility and effectiveness in meeting the variable demands through providing elastic technologies for OS services in the fos operating system.

To this end, we look at trading-off STT-RAM's non-volatility property (data-retention-time) to overcome these problems. We formulate the relationship between retention-time and write-latency, and find optimal retention-time for architecting an efficient cache hierarchy using STT-RAM.

One of the primary challenges in using CGRAs is to develop efficient compilers that can automatically and efficiently map applications to the CGRA. To this end, this paper makes several contributions: i) Using Re-computation for Resource Limitations: For the first time in CGRA compilers, we propose the use of re-computation as a solution for resource limitation problem. This extends the solutions space, and enables better mappings, ii) General Problem Formulation: A precise and general formulation of the application mapping problem on a CGRA is presented, and its computational complexity is established. iii) Extracting an Efficient Heuristic: Using the insights from the problem formulation, we design an effective global heuristic called EPIMap. EPIMap transforms the input specification (a directed graph) to an Epimorphic equivalent graph that satisfies the necessary conditions for mapping on to a CGRA, reducing the search space. Experimental results on 14 important kernels extracted from well known benchmark programs show that using EPIMap can improve the performance of the kernels on CGRA by more than 2.8X on average, as compared to one of the best existing mapping algorithm, EMS. EPIMap was able to achieve the theoretical best performance for 9 out of 14 benchmarks, while EMS could not achieve the theoretical best performance for any of the benchmarks. EPIMap achieves better mappings at acceptable increase in the compilation time.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241674","Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures;Compilation;Modulo Scheduling","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Kernel;Pipeline processing;Registers;Routing;Schedules","benchmark testing;computational complexity;performance evaluation;reconfigurable architectures;resource allocation;search problems","CGRA compilers;EPIMap;Epimorphic equivalent graph;application mapping problem;benchmark programs;coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture;compilation time;computational complexity;efficient heuristic extraction;general problem formulation;global heuristic;kernel extraction;kernel performance improvement;map applications;necessary conditions;power efficiency;resource limitation problem;search space reduction","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method is based on an observation that a single Turing-complete instruction can mirror the semantics of any other instruction. One such instruction is the subleq instruction, which has been used for instructional purposes in the past. We find that the scope for using such a Turing-complete instruction is far greater, and in this paper, we present its applicability to fault tolerance. In particular, we extend a MIPS processor with a co-processor (called ultra-reduced instruction set co-processor - URISC) that implements the subleq instruction. We use the URISC to execute sequences of subleq that are semanti-cally equivalent to the faulty instructions. We formally prove this, and implement the translations in the back-end of the LLVM compiler. We generate binaries for our hardware prototype called MIPS-URISC, which we synthesize and execute on an Altera FPGA.

The use of Partially Programmable Circuits (PPCs) has been recently proposed for yield enhancement with very small overhead. This new circuit structure is obtained from conventional logic by replacing some subcircuits with programmable LUTs. The present paper lays the theoretical groundwork for evaluating PPCs with Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) satisfiability. First, QBF models are constructed to calculate the fault tolerance and design error tolerance of a PPC, namely the percentages of faults and design errors that can be masked using LUT reconfigurations. Next, zero-cost Engineering Change Order (ECO) in PPCs is investigated. QBF formulations are given for performing ECOs, and for quantifying the ECO coverage of a PPC architecture. Experimental results are presented evaluating PPCs from [1], demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed formulations.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165045","","Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Logic gates;Multiplexing;Silicon;Table lookup","Boolean algebra;VLSI;programmable logic devices","ECO;LUT reconfigurations;PPC architecture;QBF models;VLSI chips;circuit structure;error tolerance;fault tolerance;hardware faults;partially programmable circuits;programmable LUT;quantified Boolean formula models;silicon;zero-cost engineering change order","","4","","17","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, PAR fits well to future many-core CMPs thanks to its scalable on-chip storage and coherence design. Simulation results on a 64-core CMP show that PAR can achieve 12% speedup over the baseline shared cache design with SPLASH2 and PARSEC workloads. It also provides around 5% speedup over a couple contemporary approaches with much simpler and scalable support. Translating this speedup to cache performance, PAR achieves 40% and 70% reduction over the baseline in average L1 miss latency and on-chip network traffic, respectively.

Estimation techniques based on mathematical models are usually preferred during this phase since they provide quite accurate estimation of the application performance in a fast way. However, the estimation error has to be considered during design space exploration to evaluate if a solution can be accepted (e.g., by discarding solutions whose estimated time is too close to constraint). Evaluate if the possible error can be significant analyzing a punctual estimation is not a trivial task. In this paper we propose a methodology, based on statistical analysis, that provides a prediction interval on the estimation and a confidence level on meeting a time constraint. This information can drive design space exploration reducing the number of solutions to be validated.

But there is extremely complicated data dependency and an immense amount of computation in intra prediction process. In order to meet the requirements of real-time coding and avoid hardware waste, this paper presents a parallel and high efficient H.264/AVC intra prediction architecture which targets high-resolution (e.g. 4k×2k) video encoding applications. In this architecture, the optimized intra 4×4 prediction engine can process sixteen pixels in parallel at a slightly higher hardware cost (compared to the previous four-pixel parallel architecture). The intra 16×16 prediction engine works in parallel with intra 4×4 prediction engine. It reuses the adder-tree of Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) generator. Moreover, in order to reduce the data-dependency in intra 4×4 reconstruction loop, a block-level and mode-level co-reordering strategy is proposed. Therefore, the performance bottleneck of H.264/AVC intra encoding can be alleviated to a great extent. The proposed architecture supports full-mode intra prediction for H.264/AVC baseline, main and extended profiles. It takes only 163 cycles to complete the intra prediction process of one macroblock (MB). This design is synthesized with a SMIC 0.13μm CMOS cell library. The result shows that it takes 61k gates and can run at 215MHz, supporting real-time encoding of 4k×2k@40fps video sequences.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165065","","Computer architecture;Discrete cosine transforms;Engines;Equations;Generators;Hardware;Image coding","CMOS integrated circuits;video codecs;video coding","16-pixel parallel architecture;CMOS cell library;H.264/AVC intra frame encoder;H.264/AVC video encoder;SATD generator;SMIC;block-level-mode-level co-reordering approach;encoding;four-pixel parallel architecture;intra 4x4 prediction engine;intra prediction process;sum of absolute transformed difference;video sequences","","2","","12","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An OLED panel is partitioned into multiple display areas of which the supply voltage is adaptively adjusted based on the displayed content. A DVS-friendly OLED driver design is also proposed to enhance the color accuracy of the OLED pixels at the scaled supply voltage.

This paper presents a simple yet effective scheme to solve this problem, through redesigning existing software to exploit write-activity-aware features provided by underlying hardware. Particularly, we target at page table management, a key kernel component residing in the memory management part of the Linux kernel.

More specificly, the recall function of a multi-answer character recognition based on BSB model was realized. The robustness of the proposed BSB circuit was analyzed and evaluated based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The physical constrains when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise.

In this paper, we propose two such strategies that reduce memory energy consumption and yet guarantee realtime memory performance. One provides significant energy savings without impacting the guaranteed bandwidth and latency bounds. The other provides higher energy savings with marginally increased latency bounds, while still preserving the guaranteed bandwidth provided by real-time memory controllers.

Due to the surface roughness of the optical system used in EUVL, the rather high level of flare (i.e., scattered light) becomes one of the most critical issues in EUVL. In addition, the layout density non-uniformity and the flare periphery effect (the flare distribution at the periphery is much different from that in the center of a chip) also induce a large flare variation within a layout. Both of the high flare level and the large flare variation could worsen the control of critical dimension (CD) uniformity. Dummification (i.e., tiling or dummy fill) is one of the flare compensation strategies to reduce the flare level and the flare variation for the process with a clear-field mask in EUVL. However, existing dummy fill algorithms for Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) are not adequate for the flare mitigation problem in EUVL due to the flare periphery effect. This paper presents the first work that solves the flare mitigation problem in EUVL with a specific dummification algorithm flow considering global flare distribution. The dummification process is guided by dummy demand maps, which are generated by using a quasi-inverse lithography technique. In addition, an error-controlled fast flare map computation technique is proposed and integrated into our algorithm to further improve the efficiency without loss of computation accuracy. Experimental results show that our flow can effectively and efficiently reduce the flare level and the flare variation, which may contribute to the better control of CD uniformity.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241655","Dummification;Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography;Flare;Manufacturability","Accuracy;Layout;Lithography;Merging;Minimization;Rough surfaces;Ultraviolet sources","chemical mechanical polishing;masks;minimisation;surface roughness;ultraviolet lithography","chemical-mechanical polishing;clear-field mask;critical dimension uniformity;dummification;dummy demand maps;extreme ultraviolet lithography;flare compensation;flare level;flare periphery effect;flare variation minimization;global flare distribution;layout density nonuniformity;next generation lithography;quasiinverse lithography;surface roughness","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, relatively little attention is paid to co-execution - the problem of orchestrating program execution using multiple distinct computational elements that work seamlessly together. We present Liquid Metal, a comprehensive compiler and runtime system for a new programming language called Lime.

In this paper, we advocate that binaries for timing speculative processors should be optimized differently than those for conventional processors to maximize the energy benefits of timing speculation. Since the program binary determines the utilization pattern of the processor, which in turn influences the error rate of the processor and the energy efficiency of timing speculation, binary optimizations for timing speculative processors should attempt to manipulate the utilization of different microarchitectural units based on their likelihood of causing errors.

Based on the tight requirements of low latency from CPU and the relative tolerance to long latency from GPU, DRAM is first allocated to CPU while PRAM with longer write latency is allocated to GPU. Then, in order to improve the write performance of GPU traffic, we propose (1) an in-DRAM write buffer to accommodate GPU write traffics, (2) dynamic hot data management to improve the efficiency of write buffer, (3) runtime-adaptive adjustment of write buffer size to meet the given CPU performance bound, and (4) CPU-aware DRAM access scheduling to give low latency to CPU traffics.

The proposed AMOR method is based on the observation that those adjacent nodes of interconnect circuits with almost the same voltage can be aggregated together as a “super node”. Motivated by such an idea, we propose an efficient spectral partition algorithm in AMOR method to partition the nodes into groups with almost the same voltages. The reduced-order models are then obtained by aggregating the adjacent nodes within the same groups together as “super nodes” in AMOR method. The efficiency of AMOR method is not limited by the numbers of the terminals of the networks. Moreover, noticing that the aggregating procedure can be regarded as mapping the original problem into a coarse-grid problem in multigrid method, we propose a computation-efficient smoothing procedure to further improve the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models. With such a strategy, the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models can always be guaranteed. Numerical results have demonstrated that, without the smoothing procedure, the reduced-order models obtained by AMOR can still achieve higher simulation efficiency in terms of accuracy and CPU time than the reduced-order models obtained by the existing elimination based methods. With the smoothing procedure, the simulation accuracy of the reduced-order models can further be improved with several iterations.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241525","Interconnect;Many-Terminal;Model Order Reduction","Accuracy;Capacitors;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Partitioning algorithms;Reduced order systems;Resistors","integrated circuit interconnections;reduced order systems","AMOR method;CPU time;aggregating based model order reduction method;coarse-grid problem;computation-efficient smoothing procedure;elimination based method;many-terminal interconnect circuit;multigrid method;network terminal;reduced-order model;spectral partition algorithm;super node","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, caches introduce imprecision in Worst-case Execution Time (WCET) estimation due to unpredictable access latencies. Modern embedded processors often include cache locking mechanism for better timing predictability. As the cache contents are statically known, memory access latencies are predictable, leading to precise WCET estimate. Moreover, by carefully selecting the memory blocks to be locked, WCET estimate can be reduced compared to cache modeling without locking. Existing static instruction cache locking techniques strive to lock the entire cache to minimize the WCET. We observe that such aggressive locking mechanisms may have negative impact on the overall WCET as some memory blocks with predictable access behavior get excluded from the cache. We introduce a partial cache locking mechanism that has the flexibility to lock only a fraction of the cache. We judiciously select the memory blocks for locking through accurate cache modeling that determines the impact of the decision on the program WCET. Our synergistic cache modeling and locking mechanism achieves substantial reduction in WCET for a large number of embedded benchmark applications.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241540","Partial Cache Locking;WCET","Abstracts;Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Concrete;Estimation;Program processors;Timing","benchmark testing;cache storage;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;timing circuits","WCET estimation;WCET minimization;WCET-centric partial instruction cache locking;cache contents;embedded benchmark applications;embedded processor;embedded systems;high speed processors;memory access latency;memory block selection;timing predictability;unpredictable access latency;worst-case execution time","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are considered as the potential SRAM/eDRAM alternatives for last-level caches in terms of energy and area savings. Unfortunately, these non-volatile memory technologies usually have limited write endurance. Even worse, process variation causes some cells to wear out much earlier than others. While state-of-the-art error-tolerant techniques such as ECC can handle transient soft errors, we need a new architecture for non-volatile last-level caches whose reliability is mainly challenged by hard errors. This paper presents Point-and-Discard (PAD), a hard-failure-tolerant architecture for non-volatile caches. PAD has no initial performance penalty and ensures gradual performance overhead with small storage overhead. By adopting PAD, the lifetime of non-volatile caches can be improved by 4.6X over the conventional architecture under a typical process variation condition.<sup>1</sup>","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241518","Cache;error tolerance;non-volatile memories","Arrays;Error correction codes;Multiplexing;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change random access memory","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;fault tolerant computing;integrated circuit reliability","ECC;PAD;SRAM;area savings;eDRAM;embedded DRAM;energy savings;hard-error-tolerant architecture;leakage power;nonvolatile last level caches;nonvolatile memory technologies;point-and-discard;process variation condition;storage overhead;technology scaling;transient soft errors;write endurance","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this research is almost blank. In this paper, a new method, called Gaussian Process assisted multi-objective optimization with generation control (GPMOOG), is proposed. GPMOOG uses MOEA/D-DE as the multi-objective optimizer, and a Gaussian Process surrogate model is constructed ON-LINE to predict the results of expensive EM simulations. To avoid false optima for the on-line surrogate model assisted evolutionary computation, a generation control method is used. GPMOOG is demonstrated by a 60GHz integrated transformer, a 1.6GHz antenna and mathematical benchmark problems. Experiments show that compared to directly using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in combination with an EM simulator, which is the best known method in terms of solution quality, comparable results can be obtained by GPMOOG, but at about 1/3-1/4 of the computational effort.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241559","Antenna synthesis;Differential evolution;Efficient global optimization;Gaussian Process;MOEA/D;Multi-objective microwave components synthesis;Transformer synthesis","Computational modeling;Microwave antennas;Microwave filters;Optimization;Predictive models;Vectors","Gaussian processes;evolutionary computation;microwave devices;optimisation","GPMOOG;Gaussian process surrogate model;antenna;computational intelligence technique;embedded electromagnetic simulation;generation control;integrated transformer;microwave component;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;multiobjective optimizer;multiobjective synthesis;online surrogate model assisted evolutionary computation","","0","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The state of the art Graphic Processing Units (GPU) naturally have numerous cores sharing the device memory, and provide a possible solution to the problem.

Nevertheless, there is very little research focusing on the layout decomposition for TPL. The recent work [16] proposed the first systematic study on the layout decomposition for TPL. However, the proposed algorithm extending a stitch-finding method used in DPL may miss legal stitch locations and generate conflicts that can be resolved by inserting stitches for TPL. In this paper, we point out two main differences between DPL and TPL layout decompositions. Based on the two differences, we propose a novel TPL layout decomposition algorithm. We first present two new graph reduction techniques to reduce the problem size without degrading overall solution quality. We then propose a stitch-aware mask assignment algorithm, based on a heuristic that finds a mask assignment such that the conflicts among the features in the same mask are more likely to be resolved by inserting stitches. Finally, stitches are inserted to resolve as many conflicts as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed layout decomposition algorithm can achieve around 56% reduction of conflicts and more than 40X speed-up compared to the previous work.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241656","Layout Decomposition;Manufacturability;Triple Patterning Lithography","Bridges;Color;Heuristic algorithms;Law;Layout;Lithography","integrated circuit layout;lithography;masks","layout decomposition algorithm;pattern printability;stitch aware mask assignment algorithm;stitch finding method;triple patterning lithography","","3","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A silicon PUF is a special circuit embedded in an IC that relies on random fabrication process variations to produce a unique signature for its native IC. While current research directions have focused on improving PUF quality at the architectural level, little work has explicitly targeted their fundamental source of randomness, the fabrication process. During IC fabrication, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is typically used to suppress manufacturing variations. In this paper, we recognize that this is actually counterintuitive for PUFs.

The proposed OPC techniques are validated using a population of 100 ring oscillator PUFs.

To ensure the functionality and reliability of flash memory, the pages containing address mapping information and other metadata should be carefully stored in flash memory. This paper presents Meta-Cure, a novel hardware and file system interface that transparently protects metadata in the presence of multi-bit faults. Meta-Cure exploits built-in ECC and replication in order to protect pages containing critical data. Redundant pairs are formed at run time and distributed to different physical pages to protect against failures. Meta-Cure requires no changes to the file system, on-chip hierarchy, or hardware implementation of flash memory chip. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce uncorrectable page errors by 92% with less than 1% space overhead in comparison with conventional error correction techniques.","0738-100X","978-1-4503-1199-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241513","ECC;NAND flash memory;metadata;redundancy;reliability","Ash;Bit error rate;Error correction codes;Hardware;Redundancy","NAND circuits;error correction codes;error statistics;fault diagnosis;flash memories;integrated circuit reliability;meta data","ECC;Meta-Cure;NAND flash memory storage systems;address mapping information;error correcting codes;file system interface;flash bit error rate;metadata;multibit error handling;multibit faults;redundant pairs;reliability enhancement strategy","","2","","","","","3-7 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A metric called spreading score is proposed to evaluate the layout-friendliness of microarchitectural netlist structures. For a piece of connected netlist, spreading score measures how far the components can be spread from each other with bounded length for every wire. The intuition is that components in a layout-friendly netlist (e.g., a mesh) can spread over the layout region without introducing long interconnects. We propose a semidefinite programming relaxation to allow efficient estimation of spreading score, and use it in a high-level synthesis tool. On a number of test cases, a normalized spreading score shows a stronger bias in favor of interconnect structures that have better timing after layout, compared to the widely used metric of total multiplexer inputs.

However, SDF/CSDF is limited in its ability to capture how data is accessed in time. Hence, using these models often leads to implementations that are suboptimal (i.e., use more resources than necessary) or even incorrect (i.e., use insufficient resources). In this work, we advance a new model called Static Dataflow with Access Patterns (SDF-AP) that captures the timing of data accesses (for both production and consumption).

In this paper, an integrated low-cost monitoring platform for 3D stacked mesh architectures is proposed which can be efficiently used for various system management purposes. The proposed generic monitoring platform called ARB-NET utilizes bus arbiters to exchange the monitoring information directly with each other without using the data network. As a test case, based on the proposed monitoring platform, a fully congestion-aware adaptive routing algorithm named AdaptiveXYZ is presented taking advantage from viable information generated within bus arbiters.

In this paper we integrate data reuse, loop pipelining, memory partitioning, and memory merging into an automated optimization flow (AMO) for FPGA behavioral synthesis. We develop memory padding to help in the memory partitioning of indices with modulo operations.

But the conventional way of multi-processing alone (with static resource allocation) is not sufficient enough to handle a scenario like robotic maneuver, where processing elements have to be shared between various applications and the computing requirements of such applications may not be known entirely at compile-time. Such static mapping schemes leads to inefficient utilization of resources. At the same time it is difficult to dynamically control and distribute resources among different applications running on a single chip, achieving high resource utilization under high-performance constraints. Invasive Computing obtains more importance under such circumstances, where it offers resource awareness to the application programs so that they can adapt themselves to the changing conditions, at run-time. In this paper we demonstrate the resource aware and self-organizing behavior of invasive applications using three widely used applications from the area of robotic vision - Optical Flow, Object Recognition and Disparity Map Computation. The applications can dynamically acquire and release hardware resources, considering the level of parallelism available in the algorithm and time-varying load.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164946","","Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Parallel processing;Robots;Time domain analysis;Time varying systems","image sequences;object recognition;parallel processing;resource allocation;robot vision;ubiquitous computing;video signal processing","disparity map computation;invasive computing;object recognition;optical flow;parallel computing;real-time video sequences;resource aware behavior;resource utilization;robotic vision;self-organizing behavior;static mapping schemes","","0","","21","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The invasive paradigm addresses this problem and proposes concepts to enable resource awareness and scalability - especially focusing the resource management perspective - in future multicore systems. These concepts are based on distributed and software-hardware partitioned resource management strategies. High level management decision that are made by software thereby trigger lower level management strategies that are autonomously carried out in hardware. Sufficiently accurate modeling of the overall invasive system is required to study and optimize such a decentralized, software-hardware partitioned control loop where decisions significantly depend on runtime dynamic effects.

Typically, these processors employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the communication infrastructure and core-level redundancy is often used as an effective approach to improve the yield of manycore chips. For a given application's task graph and a task to core mapping strategy, the traffic pattern on the NoC is known a priori. However, when defective cores are replaced by redundant ones, the NoC topology changes. As a result, a fine-tuned program based on timing parameters given by one topology may not meet the expected timing behavior under the new one. To address this issue, a timing similarity metric is introduced to evaluate timing resemblances between different NoC topologies. Based on this metric, a Hungarian method based algorithm is developed to reconfigure a defect-tolerant manycore platform and form a unified application specific virtual core topology of which the timing variations caused by such reconfiguration are minimized. Our case studies indicate that the proposed metric is able to accurately measure the timing differences between different NoC topologies.

Charge replacement in a HEES system (i.e., dynamic assignment of load demands to EES banks) is one of the key operations in the system. This paper formally describes the global charge replacement (GCR) optimization problem and provides an algorithm to find the near-optimal GCR control policy. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, where the objective function is the charge replacement efficiency. The constraints account for the energy conservation law, efficiency of the charger/converter, the rate capacity effect, and self-discharge rates plus internal resistances of the EES element arrays. The near-optimal solution to this problem is obtained while considering the state of charges (SoCs) of the EES element arrays, characteristics of the load devices, and estimates of energy contributions by the EES element arrays. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the charge replacement efficiency in an example HEES system comprised of banks of battery and supercapacitor elements with a high-power pulsed military radio transceiver as the load device.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165032","","Batteries;Discharges (electric);Optimized production technology;Partial discharges;Supercapacitors;System-on-a-chip","battery chargers;energy storage;integer programming;nonlinear programming;optimal control;power convertors;supercapacitors","HEES system;charge replacement;charger-converter;global charge replacement;hybrid electrical energy storage systems;mixed-integer nonlinear programming;near-optimal GCR control policy;optimization problem;state of charges;supercapacitor","","5","","13","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work develops a topology-aware ECO timing optimization (TOPO) flow that comprises three phases - buffering pair scoring, edge breaking and buffer connection, and topology restructuring. TOPO effectively improves the arrival times of violation sinks without worsening those of other sinks. Experimental results indicate that TOPO improves the worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) of benchmarks by an average of 79.2% and 84.3%, respectively. The proposed algorithm improves the arrival time that is achieved using conventional two-pin net-based buffer insertion by an average of 40.4%, at the cost of consuming 19× runtime. To speed up routing and further improve sink slack, a highly scalable massively parallel maze routing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform is also developed to enable the proposed flow to explore more solution candidates. High scalability and parallelism are realized by block partitioning and staggering. Experiments reveal that the proposed GPU-based parallel maze routing can achieve near 12× runtime speedup for two-pin routings. With parallelized maze routing, WNS violations in four out of five cases can be resolved.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164988","","Bismuth;Delay;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Routing;Topology","buffer circuits;circuit optimisation;graphics processing units;network routing;network topology;parallel architectures;timing circuits","GPU;GPU-based massively parallel rerouting;block partitioning;block staggering;buffer connection;buffering pair scoring;edge breaking;graphics processing unit platform;highly scalable massively parallel maze routing;multipin net;routed wire segment topology;topology aware ECO timing optimization;topology aware buffer insertion;total negative slack;worst negative slack","","1","","9","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New graph construction rules for multiple-port dependent sources are introduced, with which large analog circuits can be analyzed hierarchically. The new hierarchical method guarantees the cancellation-free property at each layer of hierarchy. The BDD-based hierarchical analysis method can greatly reduce the analysis complexity of the entire circuit, while the software construction and circuit partition remain easy. The new method is compared to the algebraic hierarchical method based on DDD (Determinant Decision Diagram) which does not have the cancellation-free property.

However, its tuning cost via testing is still a crucial problem. In this paper, we propose tuning-friendly body bias clustering with multiple bias voltages. The proposed method provides a small set of compensation levels so that the speed and leakage current vary monotonically according to the level. Thanks to this monotonic leveling and limitation of the number of levels, the test-cost of post-silicon tuning is significantly reduced. During the body bias clustering, the proposed method explicitly estimates and minimizes the average leakage after the post-silicon tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the average leakage by 25.3 to 51.9% compared to non clustering case. We reveal that two bias voltages are sufficient when only a small number of compensation levels are allowed for test-cost reduction. We also give an implication on how to synthesize a circuit to which post-silicon tuning will be applied.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164959","","Delay;Leakage current;Simulated annealing;Testing;Tuning","circuit testing;circuit tuning;elemental semiconductors;network synthesis;silicon","Si;bias voltages;compensation levels;leakage current;leakage reduction;monotonic leveling;process variation;test-cost post-silicon tuning;test-cost reduction;tuning-friendly body bias clustering","","0","","7","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing process variations lead to statistical input skew which induces significant interconnect delay variations. Therefore, it is necessary to take input skew variation into account for interconnect delay calculation in the presence of process variations. Existing timing analysis tools evaluate gate and interconnect delays separately. In this paper, we focus on statistical interconnect delay calculation considering crosstalk effects. A piecewise linear delay-change-curve model enables closed-form analytical evaluation of the statistical interconnect delay caused by input skew (SK) variations. This method can handle arbitrarily distributed SK variations. The process-variation (PV)-induced interconnect delay variation is handled in a quadratic delay model which considers coupling effects. The SK- and PV-induced interconnect delay variations are combined together for crosstalk-aware statistical interconnect delay calculation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can predict the interconnect delay impacted by both input skew variation and process variations with average (maximum) absolute mean error 0.25% (0.75%) and standard deviation error 1.31% (3.53%) for different types of coupled wires in a 65nm technology.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164976","","Couplings;Crosstalk;Delay;Integrated circuit interconnections;SPICE;Switches;Wires","crosstalk;delays;interconnections;statistical analysis;wires (electric)","PV-induced interconnect delay variation;SK-induced interconnect delay variations;absolute mean error;aggressor inputs;arrival time difference;coupled wires;coupling effects;crosstalk effects;crosstalk-aware statistical interconnect delay calculation;device geometries;gate delay;input-SK variations;input-skew variation;piecewise linear delay-change-curve model;process variations;quadratic delay model;size 65 nm;standard deviation error;timing analysis tools","","2","","15","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the pipeline scheduling problem for acyclic synchronous dataflow graph on a given number of cores to minimize the total buffer size while meeting the throughput constraint. We propose a two-level heuristic algorithm for this problem. The inner level finds the optimal buffer size for a given topological order of the input task graph; the outer level explores the space of topological order by applying perturbation to the topological order to improve buffer size. We compared our proposed algorithm to an enumeration algorithm which is able to generate optimal solution for small graphs, and a greedy algorithm which is able to run on large graphs. The experimental results show that our two-level heuristic algorithm achieves near-optimal solution compared to the enumeration algorithm, with only 0.8% increase in buffer size on average but with much shorter runtime, and achieves 38.8% less buffer usage on average, compared to the greedy algorithm.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164932","","Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules;Throughput","buffer storage;data flow computing;graph theory;greedy algorithms;multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;processor scheduling","acyclic synchronous dataflow graph;buffer minimization;greedy algorithm;multicore platform;pipeline scheduling problem;pipelined synchronous dataflow scheduling;processor;synchronous data flow graph mapping;synchronous data flow graph scheduling;task graph;topological order;two-level heuristic algorithm","","3","","14","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of these TSVs become placement obstacles, i.e., they interfere with clock buffers and clock TSVs; while other TSVs become routing obstacles, i.e., clock wires cannot route through them. Thus, the key is to perform TSV-induced obstacle-aware 3D clock routing under the following goals: (1) clock TSVs and clock buffers are located while avoiding overlap with placement obstacles; (2) clock wires are routed while avoiding routing obstacles; and (3) clock skew and slew constraints are satisfied.

While energy and performance tradeoffs have been studied through different dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) policies and power management schemes, tradeoffs of energy and performance with reliability have not been studied for general purpose computing. This is particularly relevant for application domains such as multimedia, where some limited application error tolerance can be exploited to reduce energy [7]. In this paper, we present EPROF, an optimization framework based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) that selects possible schedules for running tasks on multiprocessors in order to minimize energy while meeting constraints on application performance and reliability. We consider parallel applications that express (on task graphs) the performance and reliability goals they need to achieve, and that run on chip multiprocessors made up of heterogeneous processor cores that offer different energy/performance/reliability tradeoffs. For the StreamIt benchmarks [16], EPROF can identify schedules that offer up to 34% energy reduction over a baseline method while achieving the targeted performance and reliability. More broadly, EPROF demonstrates how these three degrees of freedom (energy, performance and reliability) can be flexibly exploited as needed for different applications.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6165058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165058","","Benchmark testing;Equations;Hardware;Mathematical model;Pipeline processing;Reliability;Schedules","integer programming;linear programming;media streaming;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing","DVFS policies;EPROF;MILP;StreamIt benchmark;application error tolerance;chip multiprocessor;computer system;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;energy minimization;energy reduction;energy-performance-reliability optimization framework;energy-performance-reliability tradeoff;heterogeneous processor core;mixed-integer linear programming;multimedia;parallel application;power management scheme;running task;schedule;streaming application","","2","","18","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optical interconnects also allow the performance growth of inter-core connectivity to keep pace with the growth of the cores' processing ability. However, variations in the fabrication process significantly impair an optical network's communication quality. Existing post-fabrication tuning methods, which are based on adjusting the voltages and temperatures, have very limited tunability and require excessive power to fully compensate for the variation. In this paper, we study the sources and severity of process variation, and propose two methods to enhance the robustness of an on-chip optical network: 1) adding spare modulators and detectors for post-fabrication reconfiguration and low-power tuning, and 2) introducing a combined detector/modulator structure for a more robust network topology. Simulation results show that employing both methods can reduce the tuning power from hundreds of watts to 6W while maintaining a throughput of 99.7%.

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 13 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, including USA, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea, Italy, and Taiwan. Continuing its great success in 2012, 2013 CAD contest attracts 87 teams from 9 regions, including USA, Canada, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, achieving 55% growth. Three contest problems on technology mapping, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Hwei-Tseng Wang of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on technology mapping for macro blocks. The implementation of a digital function is more flexible and powerful as technology advances. Therefore, how to fully utilize and reuse macro blocks in a highly optimized design becomes an important issue. However, it is challenging to identify the boundaries of macro blocks in such complex netlists. For the first problem, contestants are required to map and replace a given design by a set of macro blocks as much as possible. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on the placement finishing step, detailed placement and legalization. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. Although there are significant improvements on global placement techniques via recent placement contests, the need for high performance detailed placeme- t continues to grow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total wirelength, placement/pin density are optimized. Topic chair Shayak Banerjee of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. As technology advances, the printed feature size is smaller than the wavelength of the light shining through the mask. The subwavelength gap causes unwanted shape distortions. To compensate these distortions, mask optimization is performed. For the third problem, contestants are required to find the best mask solution for a given pixelated layout. The best mask solution means least EPE violations and minimum process variations over different corners measured by a provided lithography simulation model. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results.

In the 1970s, it became clear that the design of electrical and electronic circuits could be greatly aided by software tools. These tools enabled the creation of a novel electronic design automation (EDA) industry that claimed its space in the software industry. Today there is not a single IC company that does not use EDA tools. But because of this fact, EDA's overall market is saturated and enjoys modest growth. Much has been talked about extending EDA in the system space. To the rescue of a difficult path to double digit growth in EDA comes Synthetic Biology! Synthetic biology is about the synthesis of complex biological systems to obtain behaviors that do not exist in nature. A METHODOLOGY HAS come to the rescue within the past decade to reduce complexity, and to provide abstraction and design composability. The methodology is based on the availability of biological primitives: DNA-encoded 'Parts' are designed and then assembled to create modular 'Devices' that can be integrated into a host organism or assembled into a larger 'System.' This process resembles very much what we do today with integrated circuits. This methodology has enabled the development of design tools and a new discipline has emerged: Biology Design Automation (BDA). Workshops related to biodesign automation are appearing at traditional EDA venues (DAC), bioinformatics conferences (ISMB), and synthetic biology meetings (SB X.0). The way for EDA to extend to a new exciting field through the systematic construction of biological circuits maybe bumpy with detours, but eventually will enable the creation of a new industry by providing tools that make the design of living systems a true engineering discipline which is safe and effective.","0740-7475","","","10.1109/MDT.2012.2194610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327732","","Design methodology;Electronic design automation and methodology","","","","0","","","","","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We also propose dummy-cell insertion inside regions characterized by reduced fixed-macro density. Our placer consists of three major components: (i) narrow channel reduction by performing neighbor-based fixed-macro inflation; (ii) dummy-cell insertion inside large regions with reduced fixed-macro density; and (iii) pre-placement inflation by detecting tangled logic structures in the netlist and minimizing the maximum pin density.

To minimize the routing demand, POLAR 2.0 attaches very high importance to maintaining a good wirelength-driven placement in the global placement stage.

Several techniques are proposed, including (1) lookahead routing analysis with pin density consideration, (2) routing path-based cell inflation and spreading and (3) robust optimization on congested cluster. With the official evaluation protocol, Ripple 2.0 outperforms the top contestants on the ICCAD 2012 Contest benchmark suite.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560745","","Equations;Layout;Metals;Optimization;Routing;Upper bound;Wires","VLSI;integration;network routing;optimisation","ICCAD 2012 Contest benchmark suite;VLSI design;global router integration;high quality placer Ripple 2.0;high quality routability-driven placement;lookahead routing analysis;pin density consideration;robust optimization;routing congestion;routing path-based cell inflation;tangled logic;wirelength congestion","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with ever-shrinking standard cells, blind minimization of interconnect during placement causes routing failures. Hence, we develop Coordinated Placeand-Route (CoPR) with (i) a Lightweight Incremental Routing Estimation (LIRE) frequently invoked during placement, (ii) placement techniques that address three types of routing congestion, and (iii) an interface to congestion estimation that supports new types of incrementality. LIRE comprehends routing obstacles and nonuniform routing capacities, and relies on a cache-friendly, fully incremental routing algorithm. Our implementation extends and improves our winning entry at the ICCAD 2012 Contest.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560743","","Benchmark testing;Complexity theory;Estimation;Layout;Optimization;Routing;Runtime","failure analysis;integrated circuit interconnections;network routing","CoPR complexity;IC performance;LIRE;coordinated place-and-route complexity;ever-shrinking standard cells;fully incremental routing algorithm;interconnect blind minimization;lightweight incremental routing estimation;placement techniques;power dissipation;routing congestion;routing failures","","0","","","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Experimental parameter estimation of a Fractional Horsepower DC motor with unknown loads and its velocity control","Yao, J.; Ekert, C.","Dept. of Eng., East Carolina Univ., Greenville, NC, USA","Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20120820","2012","3","","802","806","Fractional Horsepower DC motors find broad applications in the automotive industry, household appliances and other consumer electronic products. Precise velocity control is often required in applications such as computer disk drives. However, one of the challenges encountered is, often times, it is hard to exactly determine the loading condition of the motor. The inaccurate model from this uncertain loading condition may result in erratic velocity control. This paper presents an experimental approach to characterize a DC servo motor loaded with an unknown torque: a steady-state approach is proposed to estimate the parameters of the entire loaded system. Based on the transfer function, a PID controller is designed to validate the resulted model. In the demonstration, a DC servo motor included in a Feedback® 33-100 mechanical unit was utilized. The PID controller was implemented on a BasicStamp® microcontroller with an external analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC).","","978-1-4673-0088-9","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6273068","PID control;loading condition;motor modeling;velocity control","","DC motors;analogue-digital conversion;control system synthesis;digital-analogue conversion;feedback;fractional-horsepower motors;load regulation;machine control;microcontrollers;parameter estimation;servomotors;three-term control;transfer functions;velocity control","ADC;BasicStamp microcontroller;DAC;DC servo motor;Feedback 33-100 mechanical unit;PID controller design;analog-to-digital converter;automotive industry;computer disk drives;consumer electronic products;erratic velocity control;experimental parameter estimation;external digital-to-analog converter;fractional horsepower DC motor;household appliances;inaccurate model;motor loading condition;steady-state approach;transfer function;uncertain loading condition","","0","","9","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, this paper presents a new computational tool, named BD<sup>2</sup>XML, to support electronic systems design. From a block diagram system of mixed-signal is generated object code in XML markup language. XML language is interesting because it has great flexibility and readability. The BD<sup>2</sup>XML was developed with object-oriented paradigm. It was used the AD7528 converter modeled in MATLAB / Simulink as a case study. The MATLAB / Simulink was chosen as a target due to its wide dissemination in academia and industry. From this case study it is possible to demonstrate the functionality of the BD<sup>2</sup>XML and make it a reflection on the design challenges. Therefore, an automatic tool for electronic systems design reduces the time and costs of the design.","","978-1-4673-5096-9","","10.1109/CERMA.2012.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524600","Computational methods;Converters;Object-oriented programming;Synthesis","","XML;convertors;digital-analogue conversion;electronic design automation;object-oriented programming","BD<sup>2</sup>XML functionality;DAC converter model AD7528 design;MATLAB;Simulink;XML language flexibility;XML language readability;XML markup language;computational tool;electronic system design;electronic system implementation;mixed-signal block diagram system;object code;object-oriented paradigm;top-down methodology","","0","","15","","","19-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless sensor mote and the network hardware subsystem play a vital role in sensing, monitoring and communication. In order to self-sustain the hardware infrastructure for the application, it needs to be self-powered, energy aware and efficient. This paper analyzes system design issues and options, architecture and performance of solar based sustainable self powered, energy aware and efficient wireless sensor motes that have been designed. Various power modules and schemes viz. Low Dropout Regulators, DC-DC converters, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling for their suitability and applicability to the wireless sensor mote design. DC-DC converter and battery management system for solar based energy harvesting have been adopted based on low quiescent current. DC-DC converter can start up from very low input voltages. Lithium-ion/ polymer battery has been used considering its high energy density and large cycle life. The battery management system comprising of battery protection, battery health-check by means of open circuit voltage measurement and fuel gauge provides required intelligence about energy density, power density and battery capacity availability to the system. The designed wireless sensor mote is scheduled to self-sustain without any change of batteries by converting the light energy into useful electrical energy and utilising the harvested energy efficiently.","2156-8065","978-1-4673-2246-1","","10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461756","WSN;Wireless sensor network;battery charging;battery management system;energy scavenging;fuel gauge;lithium ion;lithium polymer;powered networks;self;self powered;self powered motes;self powered systems;sensors;solar energy harvesting;wireless sensor mote","Batteries;Radio frequency;Regulators;Standards;Voltage control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","DC-DC power convertors;battery management systems;energy harvesting;lithium;secondary cells;solar cells;voltage measurement;wireless sensor networks","DC-DC converter;battery capacity;battery health-check;battery management system;battery protection;energy aware motes;energy aware self powered wireless sensor mote;energy density;fuel gauge;hardware infrastructure;lithium-ion-polymer battery;low dropout regulators;network hardware subsystem;open circuit voltage measurement;power density;solar based energy harvesting;solar based sustainable self powered motes","","0","","17","","","18-21 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
