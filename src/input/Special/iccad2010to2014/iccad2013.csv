In this paper, we propose a methodology to localize root causes of latency or throughput violations. We present a concurrent pattern mining approach to infer frequent patterns from transaction traces to localize root causes. We apply three categories of domain knowledge from the violation and models to filter the irrelevant transaction traces and increase the effectiveness of the mining results. We provide three culprit scenarios to mining algorithm by including transaction traces relevant to the corresponding culprit scenario. The mined concurrent patterns then belong to that culprit scenario. We provide a case study for diagnosing performance violations of an experimental platform and show that our domain knowledge can reduce the number of transaction traces by up to 92.8%. The concurrent pattern mining pinpoints the root cause to one of fewer than 10 patterns among 100000 transaction traces.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691135","","Context;Data mining;Databases;Protocols;Throughput;Time-domain analysis;Time-varying systems","data mining;performance evaluation;transaction processing","concurrent pattern mining approach;domain knowledge categories;system level performance violation root cause diagnosis;throughput violations;transaction level modeling;transaction traces","","0","","23","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accelerate post-silicon validation, high-quality tests should be ready before the first silicon prototype becomes available. In this paper, we present a concolic testing approach to generation of post-silicon tests with virtual prototypes. We identify device states under test from concrete executions of a virtual prototype based on the concept of device transaction, symbolically execute the virtual prototype from these device states to generate tests, and issue the generated tests concretely to the silicon device. We have applied this approach to virtual prototypes of three network adapters to generate their tests. The generated test cases have been issued to both virtual prototypes and silicon devices. We observed significant coverage improvement with generated test cases. Furthermore, we detected 20 inconsistencies between virtual prototypes and silicon devices, each of which reveals a virtual prototype or silicon device defect.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691136","","Concrete;Engines;Prototypes;Registers;Silicon devices;Software;Testing","automatic test pattern generation;elemental semiconductors;silicon;virtual prototyping","Si;automatic concolic test generation;device states;device transaction;generated test cases;network adapters;post-silicon tests;post-silicon validation;silicon devices;silicon prototype;system development cycle;virtual prototypes","","1","","30","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Front-end designers sometimes require large functional ECOs close to scheduled tapeout dates or for later design revisions. To avoid loss of test coverage, ECO flip-flops must be added into existing scan chains with minimal increase to test time and minimal impact on existing routing and timing slack. We address a new Incremental Multiple-Scan Chain Ordering problem formulation to automate the tedious and time-consuming process of scan stitching for large functional ECOs. We present a heuristic with clustering, incremental clustering and ordering steps to minimize the maximum chain length (test time), routing congestion, and disturbance to existing scan chains.

These trees are usually created during logic synthesis, when there is no knowledge of the tree gate locations. Because of this, large SFFTs present a challenge to placement algorithms. The consequence is that the tree placements are generally far from optimal, leading to wiring congestion, excess buffering, and timing problems. [10] proposed a fanin-tree restructure algorithm to reduce the SFFT wirelength. However, [10] was based on Steiner trees and might cause serious timing problems due to the high Steiner tree depth. In this paper, we extend the SFFT tree identification algorithm to allow both positive and negative tree inputs. Contrary to the Steiner-tree based approach, we propose a new tree restructure flow to build SFFTs from bottom to top level by level at the physical design stage. The tree restructure algorithm is in a transaction mode so that only improved trees are accepted, and the new tree won't cause any placement legal issue. A new partitioning algorithm is proposed to serve for gate creation. In addition, various optimization techniques are developed to reduce tree wirelength On tested designs, the total tree wirelength is reduced by 31% with similar tree gates and tree depths.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691176","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Logic gates;Partitioning algorithms;Steiner trees;Timing;Vegetation","buffer circuits;logic design;logic gates;optimisation;trees (mathematics);wiring","AND;OR;SFFT;SFFT tree identification algorithm;SFFT wirelength reduction;Steiner tree depth;XOR;depth controlled symmetric function fanin tree restructure;excess buffering;logic fanout-free cone;logic synthesis;negative tree inputs;optimization techniques;physical design stage;placement algorithms;positive tree inputs;symmetric function;timing problems;tree depths;tree gates;tree placements;tree restructure algorithm;wiring congestion","","0","","10","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"PROTON: An automatic place-and-route tool for optical Networks-on-Chip","Boos, A.; Ramini, L.; Schlichtmann, U.; Bertozzi, D.","","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20131223","2013","","","138","145","Optical Networks-on-Chip (ONoCs) are considered a promising way of improving power and bandwidth limitations in next generation multi- and many-core integrated systems. Today, most related research acknowledges the key role of the physical layer in assessing ONoC topologies (e.g., insertion loss), but overlooks the placement and routing stage in the design process, hence applying physical design considerations to topology logic schemes. Such a mismatch is fundamentally due to the lack of mature CAD tools for placement and routing of optical NoCs. The objective of this work is to bridge this gap: We propose PROTON, a fast tool for automatic placement and routing of ONoC topologies, which can support designers in quantifying the degradation of design quality metrics when moving from topology logic schemes to their physical implementation. This gap is especially relevant for Wavelength-Routed ONoCs (WRONoCs), where logic schemes typically make unrealistic assumptions about the placement of initiators and targets. For this reason, we put PROTON to work with the most promising WRONoC topologies and explore their physical design space given the placement and routing constraints of a 3D stacked system. We also compare automatically generated layouts with handcrafted ones reported in the literature for the same topologies and target system, and prove an insertion loss improvement by up to 150x. With PROTON the exploration of the physical design space of ONoC topologies is possible as well as their scalability analysis considering the layout.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691109","","Network topology;Optical interconnections;Optical waveguides;Propagation losses;Protons;Routing;Topology","CAD;integrated optics;network routing;network-on-chip;optical engineering computing;optical logic;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D stacked system;PROTON;automatic place-and-route tool;design process;insertion loss improvement;optical networks-on-chip;routing stage;scalability analysis;topology logic;wavelength routed ONoC","","1","","22","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since aging is workload-dependent, the aging rates of different paths are non-uniform, and hence, design time delay-balanced circuits become significantly unbalanced after some operational time. In this paper, an aging-aware logic synthesis approach is proposed to increase circuit lifetime with respect to a specific guardband. Our main objective is to optimize the design timing with respect to post-aging delay in a way that all paths reach the assigned guardband at the same time. In this regard, in an iterative process, after computing the post-aging delays, the lifetime is improved by putting tighter timing constraints on paths with higher aging rate and looser constraints on paths which have less post-aging delay than the desired guarband. The experimental results shows that the proposed approach improves circuit lifetime in average by more than 3X with negligible impact on area. Our approach is implemented on top of a commercial synthesis toolchain, and hence scales very well.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691098","","Aging;Clocks;Delays;Logic gates;Optimization;Transistors","CMOS logic circuits;circuit optimisation;iterative methods;logic design","accelerated transistor aging;aging-aware logic synthesis approach;design timing optimization;guardbands;iterative process;pessimistic timing margins;post-aging delay;reliability effects;time delay-balanced circuit design;timing violations","","3","","37","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to a wide voltage range, a very huge clock skew may occur among different power modes. To reduce this huge clock skew, the conventional power-mode-aware clock tree often suffers from a huge overhead on power consumption. Moreover, at the ULV level, since the setup time and the hold time of each register dramatically increase, the number of timing violations also increases greatly. However, the existing minimum padding technique cannot fix hold time violations in multiple power modes. Based on those two observations, in this paper, we propose a low-power timing closure methodology, which incorporates the synthesis of clock tree and data path, for multipower-mode ULV designs. Our low-power timing closure methodology has two main approaches. First, we use multiple power modes to build a power-mode-aware clock tree for reducing clock skew with very small power consumption. Second, we propose the first multi-power-mode minimum padding technique to fix all the hold time violations in all the power modes simultaneously. Experimental results consistently show that the integration of both approaches yields the best results.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691191","","Clocks;Delays;Power demand;Registers;Time factors;Wires","clocks;low-power electronics","low-power timing closure methodology;minimum padding technique;multiple power modes;power-mode-aware clock tree;supply voltage;ultra-low voltage designs;wide voltage range","","0","","14","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This co-design is necessary when the die-to-die vertical power delivery is done using both TSVs and local interconnects. In this work, we model EM for PDN of 3D ICs with a focus on multi-scale via structure, i.e., TSVs and local vias used together for vertical power delivery. We study the impact of structure, material, and pre-existing void conditions on EM-related lifetime of our multi-scale via structures.

This paper leverages the power regulation capabilities of the servers so as to enable the data centers to participate in these emerging power markets. As the data center energy consumption continues to grow, proposed participation in the power markets has the promise to achieve significant monetary savings. The paper first solves a data center regulation service (RS) optimization problem to determine the optimal average power consumption and regulation quantity that minimize the energy cost. We then propose a dynamic server power capping technique to modulate the real-time power consumption in response to ISO requests while maintaining the desired quality-of-service (QoS).

DREAMS is an improvement over prior art in that the distribution of rule violations over the diagnosis candidates and the entire design are taken into account along with the nature of the failure (e.g., bridge versus open) to appropriately weight the rules. Silicon and simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the DREAMS methodology. Specifically, virtual data is used to demonstrate that the DFM rule most responsible for failure can be reliably identified even in light of the ambiguity inherent to a nonideal diagnostic resolution, and a corresponding rule-violation distribution that is counter-intuitive. We also show that the combination of physically-aware diagnosis and the nature of the violated DFM rule can be used together to improve rule evaluation even further. Application of DREAMS to the diagnostic results from an in-production chip provides valuable insight in how specific DFM rules improve yield (or not) for a given design manufactured in particular facility. Finally, we also demonstrate that a significant artifact of DREAMS is a dramatic improvement in diagnostic resolution. This means that in addition to identifying the most ineffective DFM rule(s), validation of that outcome via physical failure analysis of failed chips can be eased due to the corresponding improvement in diagnostic resolution.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691104","","Databases;Integrated circuits;Layout;Probability;Silicon;Sociology;Statistics","design for manufacture;elemental semiconductors;expectation-maximisation algorithm;failure analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;silicon","DFM rule evaluation using manufactured silicon;DREAMS;design for manufacturability;logic diagnosis;nonideal diagnostic resolution;physical failure analysis;physically aware diagnosis;rule violation distribution;yield preserving capabilities","","1","","19","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

M1 and contact layers, which are usually deployed within standard cells, are most critical and complex parts for modern digital designs. Traditional design flow that ignores TPL in early stages may limit the potential to resolve all the TPL conflicts. In this paper, we propose a coherent framework, including standard cell compliance and detailed placement to enable TPL friendly design. Considering TPL constraints during early design stages, such as standard cell compliance, improves the layout decomposability. With the pre-coloring solutions of standard cells, we present a TPL aware detailed placement, where the layout decomposition and placement can be resolved simultaneously. Our experimental results show that, with negligible impact on critical path delay, our framework can resolve the conflicts much more easily, compared with the traditional physical design flow and followed layout decomposition.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691142","","Color;Law;Layout;Libraries;Standards;Timing","nanolithography;nanopatterning","M1;contact layers;modern digital designs;semiconductor process;size 16 nm;standard cell compliance;triple patterning lithography","","6","","27","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two-phase cooling refers to the heat removal via evaporation of a refrigerant flowing inside a heat sink. While possessing superior cooling properties, large-scale use of this technology in the industry is limited by the lack of thermal modeling tools that can accurately predict temperatures in a two-phase cooled IC. In this paper, we propose STEAM, a new compact thermal model for 2D/3D ICs with two-phase cooling via silicon microchannels. The accuracy of the STEAM model is validated against measurements from a real two-phase cooled IC test stack reported previously in literature. Temperatures were predicted with an average error as low as 10.2% for uniform heat fluxes and 6.9% for hotspots. Finally, the STEAM model is applied to a realistic 3D multiprocessor system-on-chip (3D MP-SoC) with two-phase cooling to simulate IC temperatures and the refrigerant pumping power, demonstrating the applicability of STEAM in the early-stage design of near-future high-performance computers with two-phase cooling.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691127","3D ICs;Thermal modeling;Two-phase cooling","Heating;Integrated circuit modeling;Microchannel;Refrigerants;Solid modeling","cooling;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit testing;multiprocessing systems;refrigerants;system-on-chip;thermal management (packaging);three-dimensional integrated circuits","2D IC;3D IC;3D MP-SoC;3D multiprocessor system-on-chip;IC temperatures;STEAM model;computer chips;cooling properties;evaporation;heat fluxes;heat removal;heat sink;high-performance computers;high-performance multiprocessors;hotspots;microchannels etching;real two-phase cooled IC test stack;refrigerant pumping power;silicon dies;silicon microchannels;thermal modeling tools;two-phase liquid cooling","","1","","24","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, design time techniques per se are less likely to ensure power integrity, resulting in runtime voltage emergencies. To alleviate the issue, recently several works have shed light on the possibilities of dynamic noise management systems. Most of these works rely on on-chip noise sensors to accurately capture voltage emergencies. However, they all assume, either implicitly or explicitly, that the placement of the sensors is given. It remains an open problem in the literature how to optimally place a given number of noise sensors for best voltage emergency detection. In this paper, we formally define the problem of noise sensor placement along with a novel sensing quality metric (SQM) to be maximized. We then put forward an efficient algorithm to solve it, which is proved to be optimal in the class of polynomial complexity approximations. Experimental results on a set of industrial power grid designs show that compared with a simple average-noise based heuristic and two state-of-the-art temperature sensor placement algorithms aiming at recovering the full map or capturing the hot spots at all times, the proposed method on average can reduce the miss rate of voltage emergency detections by 7.4x, 15x and 6.2x, respectively.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691154","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Measurement;Noise;Runtime;Temperature sensors;Threshold voltage","noise;sensor placement;statistical analysis","Eagle-Eye;industrial power grid designs;near-optimal statistical framework;noise sensor placement;polynomial complexity approximations;sensing quality metric;temperature sensor placement algorithms","","1","","23","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to the single level cell (SLC) design, a MLC STT-RAM cache is expected to offer higher density and faster system performance. However, the cell design constrains, such as the switching current requirement and asymmetry in write operations, severely limit the density benefit of the conventional MLC STT-RAM. The two-step read/write accesses and inflexible data mapping strategy in the existing MLC STT-RAM cache architecture may even result in system performance degradation. To unleash the real potential of MLC STT-RAM cache, we propose a cross-layer solution. First, we introduce the reverse magnetic junction tunneling (MTJ) into MLC cell design, which offers a more balanced device and design tradeoff and enables 2x storage density than SLC. At architectural level, we propose a cell split mapping method to divide cache lines into fast and slow regions and data migration policies to allocate the frequently-used data to fast regions. Furthermore, an application-aware speed enhancement mode is utilized to adaptively tradeoff cache capacity and speed, satisfying different requirements of various applications.

Especially in power grids, due to shrinking wire widths and increasing current densities, there is little or no margin left between the predicted EM stress and that allowed by the EM design rules. Statistical Electromigration Budgeting (SEB) estimates the reliability of the grid by considering it entirely as a series system. However, a power grid with its many parallel paths has much inherent redundancy. In this paper, we propose a new model to estimate the MTF and reliability of the power grid under the influence of EM, which accounts for these redundancies. We refer to this as the mesh model. To implement the mesh model, we also develop a framework to estimate the change in statistics of an interconnect as its effective-EM current varies. The proposed algorithm is quite fast and has an overall observed empirical complexity of 0(n<sup>1.4</sup>). The results indicate that the series model, which is currently used in the industry, gives a pessimistic estimate of power grid MTF and reliability by a factor of 3-4.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691168","Electromigration;MTF Estimation;Power grid;Redundancy;Verification","Conductors;Current density;Electromigration;Integrated circuit modeling;Metals;Power grids;Reliability","current density;electromigration;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;power grids","EM design rules;EM stress;SEB;current density;integrated circuits;mean time-to-failure;mesh model;mesh power grids;power grid MTF;redundancy-aware electromigration checking;series model;statistical electromigration budgeting","","1","","18","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present two automated decoder generation strategies that are able to handle non-orthogonal instruction encodings. The first one builds a decision tree that does not consider the instruction's occurrences while the second considers these frequencies. In both cases, we use binary decision diagrams to represent the instructions encodings and the complex conditions due to the non-orthogonality of the encodings in order to generate the decoders.

Owing to its NP-hard nature, this problem is solved using combinatorial heuristics. In this paper, a novel approach is taken by relaxing the integer constraints on the optimization variables and obtain an alternate noise-budgeting problem. This approach uses the quantization noise power introduced into the system due to fixed-point word-lengths as optimization variables instead of using the actual integer valued fixed-point word-lengths. The noise-budgeting problem is proved to be convex in the rounding mode quantization case and can therefore be solved using analytical convex optimization solvers. An algorithm with linear time complexity is provided in order to realize the actual fixed-point word-lengths from the noise budgets obtained by solving the convex noise-budgeting problem.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691183","","Accuracy;Adders;Convex functions;Minimization;Noise;Optimization;Quantization (signal)","computational complexity;convex programming;fixed point arithmetic","NP-hard problem;WLO problem;analytical convex optimization solvers;combinatorial heuristics;convex noise-budgeting problem;integer constraints;integer valued fixed-point word-lengths;linear time complexity;optimization variables;polynomial time algorithm;quantization noise power;rounding mode quantization;word-length optimization problem","","0","","16","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a framework for power grid transient analysis where time domain simulations are assisted by MOR techniques for scalability without losing much of the solution accuracy. Utilizing a direct sparse matrix solver and the multinode moment matching technique, we are able to achieve more than 5X speed-up using 16 processor cores distributed over two servers when simulating 1000 time steps for all the six IBM power grid simulation benchmarks, in comparison to the time domain simulations using only the direct solver.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691169","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Noise;Power grids;Servers;Time-domain analysis;Transient analysis","matrix algebra;power grids;power system transients;time-domain analysis","IBM power grid simulation benchmarks;MOR-assisted time-domain simulations;direct sparse matrix solver;frequency domain;model order reduction;multinode moment matching technique;power grid transient analysis;power supply noises;processor cores;time domain power grid simulations;time domain simulations","","0","","22","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capture and emission rates of these traps are functions of the time-varying voltages across the device, resulting in nonstationary noise characteristics. Modeling of low-frequency, nonstationary noise in circuit simulators is a longstanding open problem. It has been realized that the low frequency noise models in circuit simulators were the culprits that produced erroneous noise performance results for circuits under strongly time-varying bias conditions. In this paper, we first identify an almost perfect analogy between trap noise in nano devices and the so-called ion channel noise in biological nerve cells, and propose a new approach to modeling and analysis of low-frequency noise that is founded on this connection. We derive two fully nonstationary models for traps, a fine-grained Markov chain model based on recent previous work and a completely novel coarse-grained Langevin model based on similar models for ion channels in neurons. The nonstationary trap models we derive subsume and unify all of the work that has been done recently in the device modeling and circuit design literature on modeling nonstationary trap noise. We also describe joint noise analysis paradigms for a nonlinear circuit and a number of traps. We have implemented the proposed techniques in a Matlab<sup>®</sup> based circuit simulator, by expanding the industry standard compact MOSFET model PSP to include a nonstationary description of oxide traps. We present results obtained by this extended model and the proposed simulation techniques for the low frequency noise characterization of a common source amplifier and the phase jitter of a ring oscillator.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691163","Langevin equation;RTS noise;low frequency noise;noise analysis;nonstationary noise;stochastic chemical kinetics","Analytical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Noise;Transistors","1/f noise;MOSFET;Markov processes;circuit simulation;nanoelectronics;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device noise","1/f noise;Matlab based circuit simulator;analog circuits;biological nerve cells;burst noise;charge carriers;coarse-grained Langevin model;common source amplifier;device modeling;digital circuits;emission rates;fine-grained Markov chain model;industry standard compact MOSFET model PSP;ion channel noise;joint noise analysis paradigms;low frequency noise model;nanodevices;nonlinear circuit;nonstationary noise characteristics;nonstationary trap models;nonstationary trap noise modeling;oxide traps;phase jitter;ring oscillator;stochastic chemical kinetics;synergistic approach;time-varying bias conditions;time-varying voltages","","3","","69","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the techniques used to reduce energy consumption - clock gating, power gating, process shrinks, and voltage reduction - lead to increased voltage droops or increased sensitivity to voltage variations. Designers use voltage guardbands to minimize errors due to voltage fluctuations and inductive noise; however, this leads to lower performance because the voltage and frequency points are set to deal with voltage droops from a worst-case benchmark or stressmark. Although most applications do not approach the voltage droop caused by the stressmark, there is no mechanism to guarantee correct operation outside the tested range. In this paper, we examine floating-point issue throttling (FP throttling), a hardware technique that reduces worst-case voltage droop. By lowering the issue rate in the FP scheduler, the processor can significantly reduce the maximum voltage droop in the system. We show the impact of FP throttling on voltage droop, and translate this reduction in voltage droop to an increase in operating frequency (and hence increased performance) because an additional guardband is no longer required to guard against droops resulting from heavy FP usage. We then examine the impact of FP throttling and guardband reduction on the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and show that some benchmarks benefit from the frequency improvements with FP throttling while others suffer due to reduced FP throughput. Finally, we present two techniques to determine dynamically when to trade FP throughput for reduced voltage margin and increased frequency, and show performance improvements of up to 15% for CINT2006 benchmarks and up to 8% for CFP2006 benchmarks. Our studies are done on hardware in which FP units generate the worst-case voltage droop. The technique can be modified for architectures in which other units cause the worst droop.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691140","Di/Dt;Low Power;Performance and Power Optimizations;Reliability management;Voltage Guardband","Benchmark testing;Hardware;Heuristic algorithms;Land vehicles;Pipelines;Program processors;Resonant frequency","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","FP scheduler;FP throttling;SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks;clock gating;energy consumption reduction;error minimization;floating-point issue throttling;frequency improvements;hardware technique;inductive noise;performance boosting;power constraints;power gating;processors;reliability constraints;voltage droops;voltage fluctuations;voltage guardbands;voltage reduction;voltage variations;worst-case voltage droop reduction","","0","","18","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If a crack grows beyond the keep-out-zone (KOZ) of a TSV, it will jeopardize the reliability of the devices along its propagation path. While such threat can be eliminated by a sufficiently large KOZ, significant area overhead will be incurred. Given the low probability of crack occurrence, we argue that a much more economical approach is to keep KOZ small and filter out bad chips with cracks growing beyond the KOZ during testing. However, traditional microscope or X-ray diffraction based crack detection techniques are cost-prohibitive for massive productions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel crack sensor design with very little design or testing overhead. It is simply formed by doping the area surrounding a suspicious TSV. By measuring its DC resistances during testing, cracks that grow beyond the doped area can be easily detected. In addition, through empirical studies on crack dynamics in various TSV configurations, we provide deployment guidelines to minimize the number of sensors needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a macroscale crack detection technique.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691145","","Logic gates;Silicon;Stress;Substrates;Surface cracks;Through-silicon vias;Transistors","crack detection;electric resistance measurement;electric sensing devices;elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;silicon;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC;CTE mismatch-induced stress;DC resistances;Si;TSV configurations;TSV-based 3D integrated circuits;area overhead;bad chips;crack dynamics;crack occurrence probability;crack sensor;device reliability;dielectric liner;keep-out-zone;macroscale crack detection technique;propagation path;silicon substrate surface;testing overhead","","0","","13","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, chip-to-chip communication should be reduced whilst also ensuring that logic is appropriately partitioned to be executed concurrently. This process is exacerbated by hard constraints on accelerator capacity, as well as rapidly growing industrial designs that approach billions of gates in size.

CoDOS first represents the given target concentration as a recipe matrix, and then identifies rectangles in the matrix, where each rectangle indicates an opportunity of dilution operation sharing for reactant minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDOS can achieve up to 27% of reactant saving as compared with the bit-scanning method in single-target sample preparation. Moreover, even if CoDOS is not developed for multi-target sample preparation, it still outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithm, RSMA.

However, the performance and reliability of STT-RAM cells are greatly affected by process variations and intrinsic device operation randomness. In this work, we proposed a novel STT-RAM cell structure named ADAMS which can be dynamically configured between the high-reliable (HR) mode and the high-capacity (HC) mode upon the real-time system requirement: For the performance and reliability critical applications, ADAMS switches to HR mode. The novel connection scheme of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) devices and programming/sensing circuits substantially improve the read and write performance of the ADAMS cell and enhance its resilience to operation errors; For the capacity critical applications, ADAMS switches to HC mode. The ADAMS cell is broken into two “1T1J” cells that can work independently, offering the similar performance and reliability to conventional STT-RAM design. Simulation results show that compared to convectional 1T1J cell structure, ADAMS offers the same write latency, smaller cell area, and 12× lower write error rate. The read latency is also improved by 44.2% with 1935.8× reduction on combined read error rate.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691091","","Error analysis;MOSFET;Magnetic tunneling;Resistance;Sensors;Switches;Switching circuits","MRAM devices;magnetic tunnelling;magnetoelectronics","1T1J cells;ADAMS;asymmetric differential STT-RAM cell structure;high capacity mode;high reliable mode;magnetic tunneling junction device;nonvolatile memory technology;process variation;programming circuit;sensing circuit;spin transfer torque random access memory","","3","","17","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of this alarming gap between growing silicon capacity and design capabilities, the industry never felt the effects. Why? This invited talk reviews the findings from the 2012 Wilson Research Group Functional Verification Study and identifies the trends that prevented the design productivity gap. However, a more ominous challenge than the design productivity gap is emerging. While silicon capacity grows at a Moore's Law rate, verification effort grows at a double exponential rate, and the solutions used to close the design productivity gap will not be sufficient to close the verification productivity gap.

Datapath-oriented VLSI designs are in general hand-crafted by human at high cost, as understanding and capturing datapath structure is critical for the performance. The conventional placement algorithms by itself cannot exploit the underlying datapath due to lack of logic structure recognition and inaccurate/approximated wirelength estimation. LatchPlanner addresses such drawbacks by placing and fixing latches in the datapath context, a key element in datapath structure. By taking placed/fixed latches as constraints, a placer can find a more datapath-friendly placement effectively, which results in higher-quality hardware. LatchPlanner begins latch clustering/sizing/ordering to prepare the following steps, a) global latch placement based on linear programming to place latch clusters, and b) local latch placement based on network flow optimization to place latches within each cluster. Experimental results on eighteen industrial benchmarks show that LatchPlanner improves total wirelength by 32%, total negative slack by 25%, and area by 3% without CPU overhead over a commercial placement engine, and delivers near semi-custom-quality solutions.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691141","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Latches;Logic gates;Optimization;Pins;Very large scale integration","VLSI;flip-flops;linear programming;logic design","LatchPlanner;datapath structure;datapath-friendly placement;datapath-oriented high-performance VLSI designs;global latch placement;latch clustering;latch clusters;latch ordering;latch placement algorithm;latch sizing;linear programming;local latch placement;logic structure recognition;network flow optimization;placement engine;wirelength estimation","","2","","26","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ReRAM array structure can be built with three different approaches: a traditional design with a dedicated access transistor (1T1R) or an access diode (1D1R) for each cell, or an intrinsic cross-point structure (0T1R), where the metal-oxide is directly sandwiched between the horizontal and vertical wires. Each of these different structures has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is a complicated process to perform a systematic comparison of delay, energy, area, and cost of one over others for a given cell parameters set and technology. In this paper, we analyze both advantages and disadvantages for ReRAM arrays built in 1T1R, 1D1R, and 0T1R structures. Based on the analysis, we propose a design flow and provides key insights into architectural tradeoffs. We do this in three stages: first, we use a matrix-based mathematical model to determine the optimal array size, read/write bandwidth, and other key characteristics. This acts as input to the second stage to explore the design space of ReRAM banks and the entire chip. Finally, we estimate the chip-level cost using the area, metal layers, pin count, and cooling requirements. Using the proposed model, we also present a case study in which we compare the energy, performance, and area of a 1D1R cross-point design and a 0T1R design, and show that the 1D1R structure is more promising for a cost-driven memory design.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691092","","Arrays;Mathematical model;Multiplexing;Noise;Programming;Random access memory;Space exploration","MIS devices;integrated circuit design;random-access storage;semiconductor device reliability","0T1R structure;1D1R structure;1T1R structure;ReRAM array structure;access diode;chip-level cost;cooling requirements;cost-driven memory design;cross-point metal-oxide ReRAM;dedicated access transistor;intrinsic cross-point structure;matrix- based mathematical model;metal layers;metal-oxide resistive random access memory technology;optimal array;pin count;read/write bandwidth","","2","","30","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The verification is performed using a predictive global optimization algorithm that looks for a problematic initial state from a discretized state space. The algorithm explores the initial states that can maximize the settling time for the oscillator to reach its final steady state. If any of these initial states visited during the search is found exhibiting false oscillation behaviors for certain variability conditions, the initial state is reported as problematic. On the other hand, if the initial state with the globally maximum settling time is found without discovering such problematic states, the oscillator is reported free of start-up failures. It can be shown that despite the finite number of initial state candidates considered and finite number of Monte-Carlo samples to model variability, the proposed algorithm can verify the oscillator to a prescribed confidence level. Demonstrated on various even-stage differential ring oscillators, the algorithm was able to validate the circuit for 99% yield with 99.9% confidence level by evaluating 7~60 initial states each with 1,000 Monte-Carlo samples. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm ever reported to address start-up failures with variability.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691161","Analog/mixed-signal circuits;formal verification;global convergence failures;oscillators;predictive global optimization;start-up failures;variability","Convergence;Measurement;Monte Carlo methods;Prediction algorithms;Ring oscillators;Uncertainty","Monte Carlo methods;coupled circuits;optimisation;oscillators","Monte-Carlo samples;differential ring oscillators;initial conditions;predictive global optimization algorithm;ring-oscillator;simulation-based approach;variability conditions","","2","","15","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent advances in non-volatile STT-RAM technology, which stores data by the spin orientation of a soft ferromagnetic material and shows current induced switching, have created interest for its use as embedded memory [1-3]. When a spin-polarized current passes through a mono-domain ferromagnet, it attempts to polarize the current in its preferred direction of magnetic moment. As the ferromagnet absorbs some of the angular momentum of the electrons, it creates a torque that causes a flip in the direction of magnetization in the ferromagnet. This is used in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) based spin torque transfer (STT) RAM cells where a thin insulator (MgO) is sandwiched between a fixed ferromagnetic layer (polarizer) and the free layer (storage node). This can be integrated in the metal stack (Fig. 1) and hence provide high memory density. Depending on the direction of the current flow (perpendicular to these layers in our study), the magnetization of the free layer is switched to a parallel (P: low resistance state) or anti-parallel (AP: high resistance state) state. The minimum size cell (mincell) contains an access transistor (Tx) of width 2F (W<sub>TX</sub>=2F, F: half-pitch of the process node) and a planar storage node of dimensions 2FxF. The area of the mincell is 3Fx2F=6F<sup>2</sup>. In this paper, we examine the design space for key magnetic material properties and access transistor needed for embedded on-die memory with adequate scalability, density, read/write performance and robustness against various intrinsic variabilities and disturbances. New models and simulation methodologies, calibrated to existing measurements [1], for read, write and disturbance mechanisms are developed. Different storage node structures and materials are evaluated to reveal the most promising scaling opti- ns.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691173","","Integrated circuit modeling;Magnetic tunneling;Semiconductor device modeling;Switches;Thermal stability;Torque;Tunneling magnetoresistance","DRAM chips;MRAM devices;SRAM chips;angular momentum;ferromagnetic materials;magnesium compounds;magnetic moments;magnetic tunnelling;magnetisation","CMOS logic technology;MgO;SRAM;access transistor;angular momentum;antiparallel state;current flow;design space exploration;eDRAM;embedded on-die memory;magnetic moment;magnetic tunneling junction;magnetization;nonvolatile STT-RAM technology;on-die memory arrays;read-write performance;soft ferromagnetic material;spin polarized current;spin torque devices","","0","","10","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the problem of approximate logic synthesis (ALS). ALS is concerned with formally synthesizing a minimum-cost approximate Boolean network whose behavior deviates in a well-defined manner from a specified exact Boolean function, where in this work, we allow the deviation to be constrained by both the magnitude and frequency of the error. We make two contributions in solving this general ALS problem: The first contribution is to establish that the approximate synthesis problem un-constrained by the frequency of errors is isomorphic with the Boolean relations (BR) minimization problem. That equivalence allows us to exploit recently developed fast algorithms for BR problems to solve the error magnitude-only constrained ALS problem. The second contribution is an efficient heuristic algorithm for iteratively refining the magnitude-constrained solution to arrive at a solution also satisfying the error frequency constraint. Our combined greedy approximate logic synthesis (GALS) approach is able to operate on any Boolean network for which the deviation measures can be specified and is most immediately applicable to arithmetic blocks. Experiments on adder and multiplier blocks demonstrate literal count reductions of up to 60% under tight error frequency and magnitude constraints.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691202","","Adders;Approximation algorithms;Boolean functions;Frequency modulation;Frequency synthesizers;Minimization;Signal processing algorithms","Boolean functions;logic design;network synthesis","Boolean function;Boolean network;Boolean relations minimization problem;adder blocks;arithmetic blocks;circuit design;energy savings;error frequency constraint;error magnitude;frequency constraints;greedy approximate logic synthesis;heuristic algorithm;magnitude-constrained solution;multiplier blocks","","2","","23","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Memory sharing among accelerators leads to huge transistor savings, but needs novel designs of interconnects between accelerators and shared memories. Accelerators run 100x faster than CPUs and post a high demand on data. This leads to resource-consuming interconnects if we follow the same design rules as those for interconnects between CPUs and shared memories, and simply duplicate the interconnect hardware to meet the accelerator data demand. In this work we develop a novel design of interconnects between accelerators and shared memories and exploit three optimization opportunities that emerge in accelerator-rich computing platforms: 1) The multiple data ports of the same accelerators are powered on/off together, and the competition for shared resources among these ports can be eliminated to save interconnect transistor cost; 2) In dark silicon, the number of active accelerators in an accelerator-rich platform is usually limited, and the interconnects can be partially populated to just fit the data access demand limited by the power budget; 3) The heterogeneity of accelerators leads to execution patterns among accelerators and, based on the probability analysis to identify these patterns, interconnects can be optimized for the expected utilization. Experiments show that our interconnect design outperforms prior work that was optimized for CPU cores or signal routing.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691182","","Acceleration;Memory management;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Silicon;Switches;Transistors","application specific integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips;probability;shared memory systems","CPUs;accelerator-rich computing platforms;application-specific accelerators;dark silicon;energy-efficiency;expected utilization;interconnect design;interconnect optimization;interconnect transistor cost saving;memory sharing;orders-of-magnitude improvement;probability analysis;resource-consuming interconnects;shared memories;transistor savings","","2","","21","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a pairwise coloring (PWC) method to tackle the layout decomposition problem for general multiple patterning lithography (MPL). The main idea is to reduce the problem to sets of concurrent bi-coloring problems. The overall solution is refined iteratively by applying a bi-coloring method for pairs of color sets per pass. One obvious advantage of this approach is that the existing DPL techniques can be reused seamlessly. Any improvement of them can directly benefit to the MPL counterpart. Moreover, we observe that with the help of the SPQR-tree graph division method, each pass can be fulfilled in nearly linear time. In addition, to prevent the solution getting stuck in the local minima, a randomized initialization strategy is incorporated. The PWC method is executed certain number of times with different randomized initial solutions, out of which the best solution is selected as output. We have implemented our method for particular triple patterning lithography (TPL). The experimental results show that compared with two recently published methods for TPL, our method can reduce the number of conflicts up to 33.2% and 44.9% respectively.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691115","","Approximation algorithms;Bipartite graph;Color;Image color analysis;Layout;Lithography;Time complexity","graph colouring;lithography","PWC method;SPQR tree graph division method;TPL;bicoloring method;concurrent bicoloring problems;double patterning lithography;layout decomposition problem;multiple patterning lithography;pairwise coloring;quadruple patterning;randomized initial solutions;randomized initialization strategy;triple patterning lithography","","5","","21","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our framework can systematically model a rich set of performance constraints that are specific to the hardware design. The scheduler also exploits the unique mathematical properties of SDC to carry out efficient global optimization and fast incremental update on the constraint system to minimize the resource usage of the synthesized pipeline.

Most of the existing works target at minimizing the overall overlay, while others totally forbid the overlay. On the other hand, most of the works either rely on exponential time methods, or apply heuristic that cannot guarantee to find a solution. In this paper, we consider the SADP decomposition problem in row-based standard cell layout, where the overlay violations are minimized. Although SADP decomposition has been shown to be NP-hard in general, we showed that it can be solved in polynomial time when the layout is row-based standard cells.

In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to enlarge the width and the distance of meander segments and distribute them more evenly on the board so that the crosstalks can be reduced. In the proposed framework, we model the sharing combinations of available routing areas after removing dense meander segments from the initial routing, as well as the generation of relaxed meander segments and their groups in subareas. Thereafter, this model is transformed into an ILP problem and solved efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extend the width and the distance of meander segments about two times even under very tight area constraints, so that the crosstalks and thus the speedup effect can be alleviated effectively in high-performance PCB designs.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691193","","Crosstalk;Delays;Mathematical model;Nickel;Routing;Silicon;Wires","crosstalk;integer programming;linear programming;network routing;printed circuit design;wires (electric)","ILP problem;PCB;bus signal delay;crosstalk;high-performance printed circuit board routing design;integer linear programming;length-matching;physical wire length;post-processing method;post-route alleviation;relaxed dense meander segment generation;signal propagation","","0","","11","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such an design environment, clock frequency, silicon footprint and power profile are no longer the sole design considerations. To this, we would have to add re-usability, platform re-targetability, testability, verifiability, standards compliance check-ability and design cycle time as first-order constraints. This paper presents model-based hardware design to address these challenges. It is a design methodology that bridges the world of system designers, software programmers, hardware engineers and verification engineers to increase productivity and produce correct-by-construction designs that match the system specification. We describe the various components of the methodology and present hard evidence of the realization of these ideals as cited by several real world case studies.

"Partial synthesis through sampling with and without specification","Fujita, M.; Jo, S.; Ono, S.; Matsumoto, T.","Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20131223","2013","","","787","794","In this paper, we present techniques for partial synthesis through sampling mostly for combinational circuits. Here partial synthesis means that most parts of the target circuits are fixed whereas the missing portions must be logic synthesized from scratch. By modeling the missing portions with Look Up Table (LUT) or uninterpreted function (UF), their synthesis and verification problems can be formulated as Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF). We solve these QBF by repeatedly applying a two step procedure i.e., synthesizing circuits from sample simulation results (necessary conditions) followed by formal verification on the synthesized ones with their specifications for the entire circuits (sufficient conditions). If a circuit is not correct, a counter example is automatically generated which is added to the sampling in the next iteration. With state-of-the-art combinational formal equivalence checkers, our experiments show that large circuits having more than hundreds of thousands of gates can be successfully processed with small numbers of repetitions (in the order of hundreds). Next, we extend the techniques in such a way that no formal specifications nor formal verifiers are available, but only simulation models are used for ""correct"" partial synthesis. This is achieved by searching for multiple different solution circuits for missing portions which behave the same for the sampled inputs but differently with another input. By repeating this process, we can narrow down the search space, and the solution circuit may become only one which should be the ""correct"" partial synthesis. We show successfully experimental results with small numbers of repetitions for circuits where 32-inputs/32-outputs sub-circuits are missing.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691203","","Combinational circuits;Computational modeling;Input variables;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Radiation detectors;Table lookup","combinational circuits;formal specification;logic design;network synthesis;table lookup","LUT;QBF;combinational circuits;combinational formal equivalence checkers;formal verification;look up table;partial synthesis through sampling;quantified Boolean formulae;uninterpreted function;verification problems","","2","","16","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current state-of-the-art task mapping schemes balance the computational load among cores while avoiding congestions within the communication links. The problem is that a large number of cores running many memory-intensive tasks may congest memory controllers because their number and bandwidth is constrained. To avoid a high throughput degradation that could result from congested memory controllers, the mapping of tasks must be sensitized to the limited bandwidth of off-chip memory. Designing efficient and effective algorithms to optimize the throughput by jointly considering the load of memory controllers, computation, and communication is very challenging. In this paper, we address this problem by distributing cores among applications and then heuristically map tasks such that the load of the memory controllers is sufficiently balanced. Our heuristic also minimizes the effect of decreased throughput resulting from mapping communicating tasks to cores that belong to different controllers. Our experiments encourage us in that we can reduce the saturation of memory controllers and significantly increase the system throughput compared to employing several state-of-the-art task mapping schemes.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691164","","Amplitude modulation;Bandwidth;Memory management;Multicore processing;Pipelines;Software;Throughput","multiprocessing programs;pipeline processing;task analysis;telecommunication links","MOMA;communication links;computational load;many-core systems;mapping of memory-intensive software-pipelined applications;multiple memory controllers;task mapping schemes","","0","","30","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, GPUs only employ scratchpad memory as on-chip memory. Though scratchpad memory benefits many applications, it is not ideal for those general purpose applications with irregular memory accesses. Hence, GPU vendors have introduced caches in conjunction with scratchpad memory in the recent generations of GPUs. The caches on GPUs are highly-configurable. The programmer or the compiler can explicitly control cache access or bypass for global load instructions. This highly-configurable feature of GPU caches opens up the opportunities for optimizing the cache performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient compiler framework for cache bypassing on GPUs. Our objective is to efficiently utilize the configurable cache and improve the overall performance for general purpose GPU applications. In order to achieve this goal, we first characterize GPU cache utilization and develop performance metrics to estimate the cache reuses and memory traffic. Next, we present efficient algorithms that judiciously select global load instructions for cache access or bypass. Finally, we integrate our techniques into an automatic compiler framework that leverages PTX instruction set architecture. Experiments evaluation demonstrates that compared to cache-all and bypass-all solutions, our techniques can achieve considerable performance improvement.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691165","Cache Bypassing;Compiler Optimization;GPU","Computer architecture;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Instruments;Measurement;Optimization;System-on-chip","cache storage;graphics processing units;program compilers","GPU cache utilization;PTX instruction set architecture;bypass-all solutions;cache access control;cache bypassing;cache performance optimization;cache-all solutions;compiler framework;configurable cache;general purpose applications;global load instructions;graphics processing units;memory access;on-chip memory;performance metrics;scratchpad memory","","2","","35","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the performance of software-based simulation is vastly inadequate to achieve sufficient coverage for large microprocessor designs with complex microarchitectures. Hence, acceleration and emulation platforms are heavily deployed in the industry for high-performance validation. However, software checkers cannot be directly incorporated into such platforms, forcing designers to craft ad-hoc solutions. Adapting checking solutions for software simulation to acceleration platforms presents the following constraints: i) only a limited number of signals can be monitored per cycle for checking purposes so as to retain acceptable simulation performance, and ii) the overhead of the added checking logic must be minimal. In this work, we explore a novel solution to adapt software-based checkers for individual microarchitectural blocks to acceleration platforms, by leveraging a hybrid approach. Our solution exploits embedded logic and data tracing for post-simulation checking in a synergistic fashion to limit the associated overhead. Embedded logic can be used for synthesized local checkers as well as to compress the traced data and thus limit recording overhead. We analyze several trade-offs associated with checking accuracy and logic / recording overhead for different microarchitectural blocks of an out-of-order superscalar processor design. We strive to provide valuable insights on how to adapt such software checkers to the acceleration environment using our hybrid approach. We find that, by leveraging simple embedded checkers and data compressors (15-25% logic overhead), we can achieve excellent checking accuracy even when aggressively compressing the data for transfer (only 15-25 bits/cycle), and localize bugs up to 5,90- cycles sooner than an architectural-level checker.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691137","","Acceleration;Adaptation models;Data models;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Out of order","data compression;digital simulation;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;logic circuits;microprocessor chips","acceleration platforms;ad-hoc solutions;added checking logic;architectural-level checker;bug localization;checking solutions;data compressors;data tracing;embedded logic;high-performance validation;hybrid checking;microarchitectural blocks;microarchitectural validation;microprocessor design validation;out-of-order superscalar processor design;post-simulation checking;software simulation;software-based checkers;software-based simulation;synergistic fashion;synthesized local checkers","","1","","17","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior studies assumed that such technology would decrease main memory access latency by 45% to 60%, while also allowing designers to increase main memory bandwidth. Although the latter is true, it was recently shown that the latency savings of 3D main memory is only 6.3%. In this paper, we first analyze memory latency reduction opportunities in a 3D main memory system with Wide I/O by taking better advantage of 3D integration technology and quantify their benefit. Specifically, redesigning the DRAM to memory controller synchronizers and placing the address, command, and data pads closer to the DRAM banks can decrease 3D main memory latency by 24.7%. We show that current 3D DRAM with Wide I/O can increase the geometric mean performance of an embedded processor that is similar to a Texas instrument C67x DSP by 9.7% (and up to 23.3%). Second, we observe that 3D DRAM with Wide IO can increase average system energy consumption of energy-constrained embedded DSPs by 2.6% (and up to 8.9%). To improve I/O energy efficiency, we propose to dynamically scale memory bandwidth (i.e. the I/O width) at runtime based on an application's program phases. Our dynamic bandwidth scaling algorithms increase average performance by 6.6% while increasing average energy consumption by only 0.5%.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691198","","Bandwidth;Benchmark testing;Digital signal processing;Heuristic algorithms;Memory management;Random access memory;Three-dimensional displays","DRAM chips;digital signal processing chips;embedded systems;energy consumption;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D integration technology;3D main memory;3D-stacked DRAM;DRAM dies;TSV;Texas instrument C674 DSP;average system consumption;dynamic bandwidth scaling algorithms;embedded processor;energy consumption;energy-constrained embedded DSP;main memory access latency;memory controller synchronizers;processor die;through-silicon vias;wide IO","","0","","23","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is well known that variation in key circuit parameters can often adversely impact the correctness and performance of analog circuits during fabrication. An important problem lies in characterizing a safe subset of the parameter space for which the circuit can be guaranteed to satisfy the design specification. Due to the sheer size and complexity of analog circuits, a formal approach to the problem remains out of reach, especially at the transistor level. Therefore, we present a statistical model inference approach that exploits recent advances in statistical verification techniques. Our approach uses extensive circuit simulations to infer polynomials that approximate the behavior of a circuit. A procedure inspired by statistical model checking is then introduced to produce “statistically sound” models that extend the polynomial approximation. The resulting model can be viewed as a statistically guaranteed over-approximation of the circuit behavior. The proposed technique is demonstrated with two case studies in which it identifies subsets of parameters that satisfy the design specifications.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691186","","Analog circuits;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Least squares approximations;Polynomials;Testing","analogue circuits;integrated circuit modelling;polynomial approximation;statistical analysis","analog circuits;circuit behavior;circuit parameters;circuit simulations;design specification;parameter space;parameter variation;polynomial approximation;process variations;statistical model checking;statistical model inference;statistical verification techniques;transistor netlist level","","1","","26","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among all the emerging patterning approaches, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising candidate with high throughput and low cost for sub-20 nm features. Traditionally, the study of DSA has focused on achieving periodic regular patterns over large area. Realizing that long range order is not needed for patterning irregularly distributed contact holes, we use topographical guiding templates to alter the natural symmetry of block copolymer and achieve controlled irregular DSA patterns. However, DSA patterning must satisfy the overlay accuracy requirements while the guiding templates also need to be printable by conventional lithography. This presents a unique opportunity of DSA patterning and layout design co-optimization for improving the manufacturability of DSA. This paper discusses the DSA-aware contact layer optimization problem for 10 nm 1D standard cell library. For the first time we propose a cost function for each DSA template based on its overlay accuracy performance. Then given a standard cell library, we simultaneously optimize the layouts of every cell, such that the contact layer of any cell in the library can be fully patterned by a set of guiding templates, and the total cost of the templates is minimal. This optimization problem is first proved to be NP-hard and formulated as a Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability (MAXSAT) problem, which can be optimally solved with a public SAT solver. Then we propose a bounded approximation algorithm that solves the problem much more efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is remarkably promising in practice and validate the proposed optimization problem.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691117","1D Gridded Design;Contact Hole Patterning;DSA","Layout;Libraries;Lithography;Metals;Optimization;Standards;Wires","approximation theory;computability;immersion lithography;integrated circuit design;polymer blends;self-assembly","DSA aware contact layer optimization;DSA patterning;DSA patterns;DSA template based;DSA-aware contact layer optimization problem;IC design;MAXSAT problem;NP-hard;block copolymer directed self-assembly;bounded approximation algorithm;contact layers;conventional lithography;cost function;immersion lithography;integrated circuit designs;layout design cooptimization;manufacturability;natural symmetry;overlay accuracy performance;overlay accuracy requirements;patterning irregularly distributed contact holes;periodic regular patterns;public SAT solver;single exposure;size 10 nm;standard cell library;technology node;topographical guiding templates;weighted partial maximum satisfiability problem","","3","","25","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 13 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, including USA, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea, Italy, and Taiwan. Continuing its great success in 2012, 2013 CAD contest attracts 87 teams from 9 regions, including USA, Canada, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, achieving 55% growth. Three contest problems on technology mapping, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Hwei-Tseng Wang of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on technology mapping for macro blocks. The implementation of a digital function is more flexible and powerful as technology advances. Therefore, how to fully utilize and reuse macro blocks in a highly optimized design becomes an important issue. However, it is challenging to identify the boundaries of macro blocks in such complex netlists. For the first problem, contestants are required to map and replace a given design by a set of macro blocks as much as possible. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on the placement finishing step, detailed placement and legalization. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. Although there are significant improvements on global placement techniques via recent placement contests, the need for high performance detailed placeme- t continues to grow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total wirelength, placement/pin density are optimized. Topic chair Shayak Banerjee of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. As technology advances, the printed feature size is smaller than the wavelength of the light shining through the mask. The subwavelength gap causes unwanted shape distortions. To compensate these distortions, mask optimization is performed. For the third problem, contestants are required to find the best mask solution for a given pixelated layout. The best mask solution means least EPE violations and minimum process variations over different corners measured by a provided lithography simulation model. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691128","Technology mapping;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Force;Integrated circuits;Iris;Lithography;Optimization","electronic design automation;integrated circuit design;lithography","CAD contest;DAC contest;EDA domain;Hong Kong;IC design flow;ICCAD;IEEE CEDA;ISPD contest;Italy;Japan;Korea;Mainland China;Ministry of Education;TAU contest;Taiwan;USA;United States of America;circuit elements;computer aided design;detailed placement;electronic design automation;integrated circuit design flow;legalization;lithography mask optimization;lithography simulation model;macro blocks;mask optimization;placement finishing step;research and development","","0","","","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, using HB for simulating strongly nonlinear RF circuits still remains a very challenging task. Although direct solution methods can be adopted to handle moderate to strong nonlinearities in HB analysis, such methods do not scale efficiently with large-scale problems due to excessively long simulation time and huge memory consumption. In this work, we present a novel graph sparsification approach for generating preconditioners that can be efficiently applied for simulating strongly nonlinear RF circuits. Our approach first sparsifies RF circuit matrices that can be subsequently leveraged for sparsifying the entire HB Jacobian matrix. We show that the resultant sparsified Jacobian matrix can be used as a robust yet efficient preconditioner in HB analysis. Our experimental results show that when compared with existing state-of-the-art direct solvers, the proposed HB solver can more efficiently handle moderate to strong nonlinearities during the HB analysis of RF circuits, achieving more than 10X speedups and 8X memory reductions.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691162","","Harmonic analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Jacobian matrices;Matrix converters;Matrix decomposition;Radio frequency;Runtime","Jacobian matrices;graph theory;microwave circuits;nonlinear network analysis","HB Jacobian matrix;RF circuit matrices;graph sparsification approach;harmonic balance analysis;memory consumption;memory reductions;microwave circuits;nonlinear radiofrequency circuits","","2","","20","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method is based on the preconditioned generalized minimum residual (GMRES) iterative method implemented on heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms. The new solver is very robust and can be applied to power grids with different structures and other applications like thermal analysis. The proposed GPU-GMRES solver adopts the very general and robust incomplete LU (ILU) based preconditioner. We show that by properly selecting the right amount of fill-ins in the incomplete LU factors, a good trade-off between GPU efficiency and GMRES convergence rate can be achieved for the best overall performance. Such a tunable feature makes this algorithm very adaptive to different problems. Furthermore, we properly partition the major computing tasks in GMRES solver to minimize the data traffic between CPU and GPU, which further boosts performance of the proposed method. Experimental results on the set of published IBM benchmark circuits and mesh-structured power grid networks show that the GPU-GMRES solver can deliver order of magnitudes speedup over the direct LU solver UMFPACK. GPU-GMRES can also deliver 3-10× speedup over the CPU implementation of the same GMRES method on transient analysis.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691171","","Central Processing Unit;Graphics processing units;Integrated circuit modeling;Power grids;Sparse matrices;Transient analysis;Vectors","convergence of numerical methods;electronic engineering computing;graphics processing units;iterative methods;network-on-chip;power aware computing;transient analysis","GMRES convergence rate;GPU efficiency;GPU-GMRES;IBM benchmark circuits;ILU-based preconditioner factors;computing task partitioning;data traffic minimization;heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms;incomplete LU-based preconditioner;mesh-structured power grid networks;parallel dynamic linear solver;parallel power grid analysis;preconditioned GMRES solver;preconditioned generalized minimum residual iterative method;thermal analysis;transient analysis","","3","","25","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normally, TSV is considered as a good thermal conductor in its vertical direction, and its vertical thermal resistance has been studied extensively. However, lateral heat transfer of TSVs, which is also important, was largely ignored in the past. In this paper, we propose an accurate physics-based model for lateral resistance of TSVs in terms of physical and material parameters, and discuss the conditions valid for model accuracy. In addition to modeling the lateral thermal resistance of a single TSV, the proposed thermal model is also applicable to TSV arrays or TSV farms. We show that the TSV insulation linear and space between TSVs could impose a significant impact on TSV thermal behavior. The new TSV thermal model can be easily integrated into a finite difference based thermal analysis framework to improve analysis efficiency. The accuracy of the model is validated against a commercial finite element tool - COMSOL. Experimental results show that the proposed TSV lateral thermal resistance model is very accurate for both a single TSV and TSV arrays.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691132","","Arrays;Calibration;Insulation;Silicon;Thermal resistance;Through-silicon vias","finite difference methods;integrated circuit modelling;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging);thermal resistance;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D stacked IC;COMSOL;TSV array;TSV farms;TSV insulation;compact lateral thermal resistance modeling;finite difference based thermal analysis framework;finite element tool;lateral heat transfer;material parameters;model accuracy;physical parameters;physics-based model;thermal conductor;thermal issues;thermal model;through silicon vias;vertical direction;vertical thermal resistance","","1","","17","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Repeatedly printing and stacking such shapes on top of each other to build electrical circuits allows us to manufacture chips in high volume. However this technique has now reached its fundamental physical limits of resolution. Current 193nm wavelength light is no longer sufficient to reliably transfer patterns which are now in the sub-100nm dimensional range. This has led to increased research in optimizing lithographic masks to pre-compensate for distortions introduced by the lithographic process. This is called mask optimization. In this contest, students are provided with a sample lithographic model which simulates the transfer of a mask pattern on to wafer. The mask is assumed to be a pixelated template, where every pixel can be turned on or off, to indicate where light passes through, or is blocked. Contestants are also provided with models to predict the robustness of their pattern i.e. how much variability is in the transferred pattern. Given these tools, the objective is to minimize the variability in the wafer image, as measured by process variability (PV) bands. This is subject to the constraints of runtime and satisfying pattern fidelity i.e. the transferred pattern should resemble the target pattern. Benchmarks are provided in the form of collections of geometric shapes, each of which provides a challenge in printing at sub-wavelength.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691131","","Benchmark testing;Layout;Optical imaging;Optimization;Resists;Semiconductor device modeling;Shape","CAD;masks","ICCAD-2013 CAD contest;PV bands;benchmark suite;electrical circuits;lithographic mask optimization;mask pattern;optical microlithography;process variability bands;wavelength 193 nm","","0","","14","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mechanism is robust: any small perturbation or leakage in the concentrations quickly gets cleared out and the signal value is not affected. Based on this representation for bits, a constituent set of logical components are implemented. These include combinational components - AND, OR, NOR, and XOR - as well as sequential components - D latches and D flip-flops. Using these components, three full-fledged design examples are given: a square-root unit, a binary adder and a linear feedback shift register.

Mitigating soft error requires enhancing the underlying system with error recovery functionality, which typically leads to considerable design cost overhead, in terms of performance, power and area. For embedded systems, where stringent design constraints apply, such cost must be properly bounded. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology DHASER, which enables efficient error recovery functionality for embedded ASIP-based multi-core systems. DHASER consists of three main parts: task level correctness (TLC) analysis, TLC-based processor/core customization, and runtime reliability-aware task management mechanism.

Recent proposals for spin-based computing schemes may be differentiated as `all-spin' vs. hybrid, programmable vs. fixed, and, Boolean vs. non-Boolean. Allspin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small form-factor of nano-magnetic devices. However, circuit and system-level design techniques need to be explored that leaverage the specific spin-device characterisitcs to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nano-magnets can be exploited in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic. In such logic-styles, spin-devices may play the dual-role of computing as well as memory-elements that provide field-programmability. Spin-based threshold logic design is presented as an example. Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultra-low-voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing. Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing hardware for applicatons like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing, image-processing and data-conversion. Towards the end, we discuss the possibility of applying emerging spin-torque switches in the design of energy-efficient global interconnects, for future chip multiprocessors.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691174","analog;interconnect;logic;low power;neural networks;non-Boolean;programmable logic array;spin;threshold logic","CMOS integrated circuits;Energy efficiency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Magnetic domain walls;Magnetic domains;Magnetic tunneling;Neurons","Boolean functions;energy conservation;magnetic logic;magnetoelectronics;nanomagnetics;threshold logic","Boolean computing;CMOS;all-spin logic-styles;analog processing;charge-based devices;chip multiprocessors;circuit-level design techniques;energy-efficient global interconnects;energy-efficient information processing hardware;form-factor;nanomagnetic devices;nonBoolean computing;nonBoolean data-processing applications;nonvolatile nanomagnets;performance;reliability;resistive memory;spin torque devices;spin-based threshold logic design;spin-device characterisitcs;spin-torque switches;spintronic phenomena;system-level design techniques","","0","","38","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last decade, we observed impressive improvements both in quality and speed of academic placement algorithms, in part enabled by the availability of realistic benchmarks and common evaluation frameworks along the history of ISPD, DAC and ICCAD placement contests. However, most research innovations have heavily relied on improvement and extensions of global placement algorithms [4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15]. Detailed placement has been often limited to mixing existing methods and local interconnect length recovery, and individual impacts and relative performances of different detailed placement algorithms remain unclear. The goal of the ICCAD-2013 detailed-placement contest is to address these issues. In this contest, we provide (i) a suite of realistic benchmarks derived from industrial ASIC including input legal placements to detailed placers, and (ii) an evaluation framework to specifically measure the impact of detailed placement optimizations. To judge the quality of resulting placements, we consider both Half-Perimeter Wirelength (HPWL) and placement density, and impose maximum cell displacement limitations to the detailed placers. We hope that a set of standardized benchmarks and an evaluation framework will further accelerate research in the area of detailed placement.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691130","Algorithms;Optimization;Physical Design;Placement","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Law;Measurement;Optimization;Runtime","VLSI;integrated circuit design;logic CAD","DAC placement contests;HPWL;ICCAD placement contests;ICCAD-2013 detailed-placement contest;ISPD placement contests;application specific integrated circuits;benchmark suite;global placement algorithms;half-perimeter wirelength;high-performance legalization;highly-optimized placements;industrial ASIC;interconnect length;placement density;placement finishing;research innovations;resource distribution","","0","","18","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such generators are parameterized design procedures that produce sized schematics and correct layouts optimized to meet a set of input specifications. BAG extends previous work by implementing interfaces to integrate all steps of the design flow into a single environment and by providing helper classes - both at the schematic and layout level - to aid the designer in developing truly parameterized and technology-independent circuit generators. This simplifies the codification of common tasks including technology characterization, schematic and testbench translation, simulator interfacing, physical verification and extraction, and parameterized layout creation for common styles of layout. We believe that this approach will foster design reuse, ease technology migration, and shorten time-to-market, while remaining close to the classical design flow to ease adoption. We have used BAG to design generators for several circuits, including a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and a Switched-Capacitor (SC) voltage regulator in a CMOS 65nm process.

This paper introduces a novel placement flow with clock-tree aware flip-flop merging and MBFF generation, and proposes the corresponding algorithms to simultaneously minimize flip-flop power and clock latency when applying MBFFs during placement. Experimental results based on the IWLS-2005 benchmark show that our approach is very effective in not only flip-flop power but also clock latency minimization without degrading circuit performance.

One popular solution for such hardware security attacks are physical unclonable functions (PUF) which provide a hardware specific unique signature or identification. The uniqueness of a PUF depends on intrinsic process variations within individual integrated circuits. As process variations become more prevalent due to technology scaling into the nanometer regime, novel nanoelectronic technologies such as memristors become viable options for improved security in emerging integrated circuits. In this paper, we describe a novel memristive PUF (M-PUF) architecture that utilizes variations in the write-time of a memristor as an entropy source. The results presented show strong statistical performance for the M-PUF in terms of uniqueness, uniformity, and bit-aliasing. Additionally, nanoscale M-PUFs are shown to exhibit reduced area utilization as compared to CMOS counterparts.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691209","VLSI;digital integrated circuits;hardware security;memristors;nanoelectronics","CMOS integrated circuits;Hardware;Memristors;Resistance;Security;Switches","VLSI;digital integrated circuits;memristors;nanoelectronics","CMOS counterparts;M-PUF architecture;VLSI;bit-aliasing;digital integrated circuit;entropy source;hardware security attacks;hardware specific unique signature;integrated circuits;intrinsic process variations;nanoelectronic technology;nanometer regime;physical unclonable functions;side channel attacks;write-time based memristive PUF","","1","","25","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The higher levels of temperature on die and the very large number of metal lines, coupled with the conservatism inherent in traditional EM checking strategies, have led to a situation where trying to guarantee EM reliability often leads to unacceptably conservative designs that may not meet the area or performance specs. Due to unidirectional currents, this problem is most significant in the power and ground grids. Thus, this work is aimed at reducing the pessimism in EM prediction for power/ground grids. There are two sources for the high pessimism: 1) the use of the traditional series model for EM checking and 2) pessimistic assumptions about the chip workload and the corresponding supply currents. To address this problem, we propose a framework for EM checking that allows users to specify conditions-of-use type constraints that help capture realistic chip workload and which includes the use of a novel mesh model for EM prediction in the grid, instead of the traditional series model.","1092-3152","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691170","Electromigration;Optimization;Power grid;Redundancy;Verification","Electromigration;Integrated circuit modeling;Metals;Monte Carlo methods;Power grids;Solid modeling;Vectors","VLSI;electromigration;integrated circuit modelling","EM checking strategies;EM reliability;chip workload;ground grids;mesh model;modern VLSI circuits;on-die metal lines;power grid electromigration checking;supply currents;traditional series model;unidirectional currents;vectorless framework","","1","","14","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annual CAD Contest in Taiwan has been held for 14 consecutive years and has successfully boosted the EDA research momentum in Taiwan. To encourage better research development on timely and practical EDA problems across all domains, CAD Contest is internationalized since 2012 under the joint sponsorship of the IEEE CEDA and Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan. 2012 CAD Contest attracted 56 teams from 7 regions, while 2013 CAD contest attracted 87 teams from 9 regions. Continuing its great success in 2012 and 2013, 2014 CAD contest attracts 93 teams from 9 regions, including Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, US, Canada, Brazil, and Russian Federation. Three contest problems on verification, placement, and mask optimization are announced this year and run by industry experts from Cadence and IBM. Topic chair Chih-Jen Hsu of Cadence Design Systems manages the first contest problem, concentrating on efficiently solving the combinational single-output netlists. The efficiency of solving a single-output function highly depends on the CNF encoding and the SAT solving. For the first problem, contestants are required to explore the best CNF encoding and SAT solver setting to solve the most tests within the shortest runtime. Topic chair Myung-Chul Kim of IBM manages the second problem, focusing on incremental timing-driven placement. Placement, which determines locations of circuit elements, is one of the most crucial steps in the modern IC design flow. For the second problem, contestants are required to perform local refinements on a legal design such that the total slack and worst slack are optimized. Topic chair Rasit O. Topaloglu of IBM manages the third problem, exploring lithography mask optimization. In a circuit layout, densities of polygons within windows of interest may have a large v- riation across such windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, fills are inserted to make the density of several windows uniform. For the third problem, contestants are required to minimize the density variation with least fills. This session will include three presentations from the contest organizers for these contest problems and an award ceremony. Each contest organizer (topic chair) will present detailed information about the corresponding contest problem, including problem description, benchmarks, and evaluation. Along with the contest, a new set of industrial benchmarks for each contest problem will be released and facilitate scientific evaluations of related research results. We expect that the benchmark suites will further play a key driving force to push the advancement of related research. Moreover, we also expect that the participants will submit their works to the subsequent top conferences to boost related research and also extend the impacts of this contest.","","","","10.1109/ICCAD.2014.7001374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001374","Verification;lithography;placement","Benchmark testing;Design automation;Educational institutions;Encoding;Force;Integrated circuits;Optimization","","","","0","","","","","2-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
