"Variation-aware electromigration analysis of power/ground networks","Di-an Li; Marek-Sadowska, M.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

The existing backend design flows use the maximum allowed current density as the only practical guidance to prevent EM. There is a need for tools capable of performing comprehensive EM analyses. In this paper, we first explain why current density alone does not determine wire's susceptibility to EM. We introduce our variation-aware EM analysis tool, VEMA, for power/ground networks, which are typically the EM-critical parts of a chip. Our tool considers two types of variations: circuit-level and wire geometry-level. VEMA reports distributions of wire lifetimes for circuit-level variations. Compared to existing EM analyzer SysRel, VEMA filters out EM-immortal wires more efficiently and provides detailed feedback for EM violation corrections. VEMA also provides information of geometry-level tolerance for EM-mortal wires.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105387","Electromigration;lifetime distribution;power/ground network;process variation;variation tolerance","Current density;Finite element methods;Integrated circuit modeling;Metals;Solid modeling;Stress;Wires","current density;electromigration;integrated circuit reliability;microprocessor chips;wires (electric)","EM analyzer SysRel;EM-critical parts;EM-immortal wires;VEMA filters;chip;circuit-level;current density;geometry-level tolerance;power/ground networks;reliability problem;shrinking wire dimensions;variation aware electromigration;wire geometry-level;wire susceptibility","","1","","9","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bounded uncertain parameters in the behavioral model make it possible to represent all possible behaviors of more detailed models. The dynamics of the behavioral model is hybrid (i.e., discrete and continuous) due to the switching of charge pumps that drive the analog control circuits. A unique feature of phase-locked loops compared to most other hybrid systems is that they require thousands of switchings in the continuous dynamics to converge sufficiently close to a limit cycle. This makes reachability analysis a challenging task since switches in the dynamics are expensive to compute and result in conservative overapproximations. We solve this problem by overapproximating the effects of the switching conditions with uncertain parameters in linear continuous models, a method we call continuization. Using efficient reachability algorithms for discrete-time linear systems, locking is verified over the complete range of possible initial states of a charge-pump PLL designed in 32nm CMOS SOI technology in comparable time required for Monte Carlo simulations of the same behavioral model.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105400","","Charge pumps;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Phase frequency detector;Phase locked loops;Reachability analysis;Switches","CMOS integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;charge pump circuits;electronic engineering computing;formal verification;phase locked loops;silicon-on-insulator","CMOS SOI technology;Monte Carlo simulations;analog control circuits;charge-pump PLL;circuit behavioral model;conservative overapproximations;continuization;discrete-time linear systems;formal verification;linear continuous models;phase-locked loops;reachability analysis;size 32 nm;switching conditions","","13","","28","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a fully parameterized system, not only the state matrices, but also can the input/output matrices be parameterized. The algorithm presented in this paper is based on neither conventional moment-matching nor balanced-truncation ideas. Instead, it uses “optimal (block) vectors” to construct the projection matrix, such that the system errors in the whole parameter space are minimized. This minimization problem is formulated as a recursive least square (RLS) optimization and then solved at a low cost. Our algorithm is tested by a set of multi-port multi-parameter cases with both intermediate and large parameter variations. The numerical results show that high accuracy is guaranteed, and that very compact models can be obtained for multi-parameter models due to the fact that the ROM size is independent of the number of parameters in our approach.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105380","","Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Optimization;Read only memory;Vectors","least squares approximations;matrix algebra;minimisation;reduced order systems;vectors","ROM size;fully parameterized linear dynamic systems;input-output matrices;minimization problem;model order reduction;multiport multiparameter cases;optimal vectors;projection matrix;recursive least square optimization;state matrices","","2","","23","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the presence of Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations, the Post-Silicon Skew Tuning (PST) technique with the ability of tolerating PVT variations has brought a broad discussion. A PST architecture can dynamically minimize the clock skew even after a chip is manufactured. However, testing the variation tolerance ability of a PST architecture is very difficult because the clock skew does not directly affect the functionality of a design. In addition, creating PVT variation in the traditional testing environment is not easy. Unlike most previous works which focus on the implementation and the performance issues of a PST architecture, the objective of this paper is to propose efficient test mechanisms and verify the variation tolerance ability. In addition, we also propose a novel structure to increase the robustness of a PST architecture in case of a manufacturing fault. Our experiment shows that with little overhead, we can achieve robustness.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105417","Adjustable Delay Buffer;Phase Detector;Post-Silicon Tuning","Clocks;Delay;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Logic gates;Synchronization;Testing","VLSI;clocks;integrated circuit design","VLSI design;clock skew minimization;performance issue;post silicon skew tuning;process variation;temperature variation;voltage variation","","1","","9","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite of the recent developments of global routers, there exist only two types of choices: slow 3D routers with good solution quality or efficient 2D routers with relatively poor solution quality. We propose a multi-level 3D global router called MGR to fill the gap. MGR resorts to an efficient multi-level framework to reroute nets in the congested region on the 3D grid graph. Routing on the coarsened grid graph speeds up the global router while 3D routing introduces less vias. The powerful multi-level rerouting framework wraps three innovative routing techniques together: adaptive resource reservation in coarsening process, a new 3-terminal maze routing algorithm and network flow based solution propagation in uncoarsening process. As a result, MGR can achieve the solution quality close to 3D routers with comparable runtime of 2D routers.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105336","","Estimation;Joining processes;Metals;Routing;Runtime;Steiner trees;Three dimensional displays","network routing;resource allocation","2D routers;3-terminal maze routing;3D grid graph;MGR;adaptive resource reservation;coarsened grid graph;congested region;multilevel 3D global router;multilevel rerouting framework;network flow;slow 3D routers","","6","","13","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the increasing size of power grids IR drop analysis has become more computationally challenging both in runtime and memory consumption. This work presents a fast Poisson solver preconditioned method for unstructured power grid with unideal boundary conditions. In fact, by taking the advantage of analytical formulation of power grids this analytical preconditioner can be considered as sparse approximate inverse technique. By combining this analytical preconditioner with robust conjugate gradient method, we demonstrate that this approach is totally robust for extremely large scale power grid simulations. Experimental results have shown that iterations of our proposed method will hardly increase with grid size increasing once the pads density and the range of metal resistances value distribution have been decided. We demonstrated that this approach solves an unstructured power grid with 2.56M nodes in only 1/3 iterations of classical ICCG solver, and achieves almost 20X speedups over the classical ICCG solver on runtime.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105381","Fast Poisson Solver;Power Grid;Preconditioning","Equations;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Metals;Power grids;Resistance;Robustness","VLSI;conjugate gradient methods;integrated circuit design;power grids","VLSI design;VLSI optimization;fast Poisson solver preconditioned method;memory consumption;power grids IR drop analysis;robust conjugate gradient method;robust power grid analysis;sparse approximate inverse technique;unideal boundary conditions;unstructured power grid","","5","","14","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then develop an exact algorithm based on the binary integer linear programming (ILP) and also a heuristic based on the simulated annealing (SA), both enabled by the locality. We report results for the 10 largest MCNC combinational benchmarks synthesized by ABC and then placed and routed by VPR. The results show that IPV obtains close to 4× chip level SER reduction on average and SA is highly effective by obtaining the same SER reduction as ILP does. A recent work IPD has the largest LUT level SER reduction of 2.7× in literature, but its chip level SER reduction is merely 7% due to the dominance of interconnects. In contrast, SA-based IPV obtains nearly 4× chip level SER reduction and runs 30× faster. Furthermore, combining IPV and IPD leads to a chip level SER reduction of 5.3×. This does not change placement and routing, and does not affect design closure.

Our methodology maps OpenCL kernels into hardware accelerators, based on architectural templates that explicitly decouple computation from memory communication whenever this is possible. The templates can be tuned to provide a wide repertoire of accelerators that meet user performance requirements and FPGA device characteristics. Furthermore, a set of high- and low-level compiler optimizations is applied to generate optimized accelerators. Our experimental evaluation shows that the generated accelerators are tuned efficiently to match the applications memory access pattern and computational complexity, and to achieve user performance requirements.

As an integrated circuit (IC) ages, the manifestational properties of the gates change, and thus the ID used for hardware metering can not be valid over time. Additionally, the previous approaches require large amounts of costly measurements and often are difficult to scale to large designs. We resolve the deleterious effects of aging by going to the physical level and primarily targeting the characterization of threshold voltage. Although threshold voltage is modified with aging, we can recover its original value for use as the IC identifier. Another key aspect of our approach involves using IC segmentation for gate-level characterization. This results in a cost effective approach by limiting measurements, and has a significant effect on the approach scalability.

Focusing on the first silicon prototypes, post-silicon validation poses critical new challenges such as intermittent failures, where multiple executions of a same test do not yield a consistent outcome. These are often due to on-chip asynchronous events and electrical effects, leading to extremely time-consuming, if not unachievable, bug diagnosis and debugging processes. In this work, we propose a methodology called BPS (Bug Positioning System) to support the automatic diagnosis of these difficult bugs. During post-silicon validation, lightweight BPS hardware logs a compact encoding of observed signal activity over multiple executions of the same test: some passing, some failing. Leveraging a novel post-analysis algorithm, BPS uses the logged activity to diagnose the bug, identifying the approximate manifestation time and critical design signals.

At each iteration, a local quadratic model of the front is used to estimate an appropriate weighted sum of objectives that, on optimization, will give the next point on the front. A single objective optimization on this weighted sum then generates the actual point, which is then used to build a new local model. The method uses convexity-based heuristics to improve on mildly sub-optimal results from the optimizer and reuses cached points to improve the optimization speed and quality. We test the method on a synthetic and a 6-T SRAM power-performance tradeoff test case to demonstrate its effectiveness.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105375","","Computational modeling;Convergence;Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Optimization;Random access memory","Pareto optimisation;convex programming;iterative methods","6-T SRAM power-performance tradeoff test case;PTrace method;bicriterial design tradeoff;bicriterial optimization problem;cached points;convex bicriterial Pareto-optimal front tracing;convexity-based heuristics;derivative-free local tracing;design variables;local quadratic model;optimization quality;optimization speed;single objective optimization;spacing constraint;weighted sum","","0","","11","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a systematic methodology, called MACACO, for the Modeling and Analysis of Circuits for Approximate Computing. The proposed methodology can be utilized to analyze how an approximate circuit behaves with reference to a conventional correct implementation, by computing metrics such as worst-case error, average-case error, error probability, and error distribution. The methodology applies to both timing-induced approximations such as voltage over-scaling or over-clocking, and functional approximations based on logic complexity reduction. The first step in MACACO is the construction of an equivalent untimed circuit that represents the behavior of the approximate circuit at a given voltage and clock period. Next, we construct a virtual error circuit that represents the error in the approximate circuit's output for any given input or input sequence. Finally, we apply conventional Boolean analysis techniques (SAT solvers, BDDs) and statistical techniques (Monte-Carlo simulation) in order to compute the various metrics of interest. We have applied the proposed methodology to analyze a range of approximate designs for datapath building blocks. Our results show that MACACO can help a designer to systematically evaluate the impact of approximate circuits, and to choose between different approximate implementations, thereby facilitating the adoption of such circuits for approximate computing.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105401","","Adders;Approximation methods;Boolean functions;Data structures;Delay;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates","equivalent circuits;error statistics;integrated circuit modelling;statistical analysis","Boolean analysis techniques;MACACO;average-case error;equivalent untimed circuit;error distribution;error probability;functional approximations;logic complexity reduction;modeling and analysis of circuits for approximate computing;over-clocking;statistical techniques;voltage over-scaling;worst-case error","","18","","28","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key step in the migration process is to insert pulsers, which generate clock pulse to drive local latches; the number of pulsers as well as the wirelength of clock routing must be minimized to reduce the clocking power. We formulate a pulser insertion problem to find a set of latch groups where each group shares a pulser and its load constraint is satisfied; both an ILP formulation and a heuristic algorithm are presented to solve the problem. Experimental results of circuits implemented with 32-nm CMOS technology show that the clocking power of pulsed-latch designs obtained by our approach is 5.9% less than that of greedy approach; this is 44.7% less than that of flip-flop designs. We also consider the problem of pulsed-register where a pulser is integrated with multiple latches. A concept of logical distance is explored during our clustering algorithm to minimize the overhead of signal wirelength when converting flip-flops to pulsed-registers.

The biggest technical challenge of DP is the presence of mask-assignment conflicts in dense layers. In this paper, we propose a framework for DP conflict removal for standard cells. First, we offer an O(n) algorithm for mask assignment (up to 200× faster than the ILP-based approach) that guarantees a conflict-free solution if one exists. We then formulate the problem of conflict removal as a linear program (LP), which permits an extremely fast run-time (less than 10 seconds in real time for typical cells). The framework removes DP conflicts and legalizes the layout across all layers simultaneously while minimizing layout perturbation. For cells from a commercial 22nm library designed without any DP awareness, our method usually removes all DP conflicts without any area increase; for some complex cells, the method still removes all conflicts with a modest 6.7% average increase in area. The method is more general, however, and can also be applied for macro layouts and the interconnect layers in complete designs as we demonstrate in the paper.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105299","","Art;Compaction;Labeling;Layout;Lithography;Shape;Wires","integer programming;linear programming;photolithography","ILP;double patterning optical lithography;integer linear programming;layout perturbation minimization;mask-assignment conflict;next generation of lithography system;size 22 nm","","6","","19","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The chosen cutting planes target to prune more infeasible subspaces so that the solution densities in other subspaces increase correspondingly. In addition, with statistics-based analyses, the estimated solution densities precisely predict the distribution of solutions. The intermediate statistical information is recorded in a range-splitting tree (RS-tree). By top-down random walking on the RS-tree, random pattern generation produces evenly-distributed patterns with high throughput.

Crossbars and links form the core of a network datapath, and integrating low-swing links within these will reduce power significantly.

This is due to the potentially impaired ability to identify device pass/fail labels when departing from traditional specification test. By relying on alternative tests, pass/fail labels must be derived indirectly through new test limits defined for the alternative tests, which may incur error in the form of test escapes or yield loss. Clearly, estimating these test metrics as early as possible in the test development process is key to the success of an alternative test approach. In this work, we employ a test metrics estimation technique based on non-parametric kernel density estimation to obtain such early estimates, and, for the first time, demonstrate a real-world case study of test metric estimation efficiency at parts-per-million levels.

In fact, over 70% of the IC design turn-around time can be spent on the verification process in a typical IC design project. Among various verification tasks, Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation is the most widely used method to validate the correctness of digital IC designs. When simulating a large IC design with complicated internal behaviors (e.g., CPU cores running embedded software), RTL simulation can be extremely time consuming. Since RTL-to-layout is still the most prevalent IC design methodology, it is essential to speedup the RTL simulation process. Recently, General Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) is becoming a promising paradigm to accelerate computing-intensive workloads. A few recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of using GPU to expedite gate and system level simulation tasks. In this work, we proposed an efficient GPU-accelerated RTL simulation framework. We introduce a methodology to translate Verilog RTL description into equivalent GPU source code so as to simulate circuit behavior on GPUs. In addition, a CMB based parallel simulation protocol is also adopted to provide a sufficient level of parallelism. Because RTL simulation lacks data-level parallelism, we also present a novel solution to use GPU as an efficient task-level parallel processor.

This makes Hermite spline-based table models practical for use in simulations for process variation modeling.

In this paper, we propose novel pseudo-functional testing techniques to tackle the above problem. Firstly, by taking the circuit layout information into account, functional constraints related to critical paths are extracted. Then, we generate functionally-reachable test cubes for SDD faults in the circuit. Finally, we use ATPG-like algorithm to justify transitions that pose the maximized PSN effects on sensitized critical paths under the consideration of functional constraints.

This is achieved by using structural dominance relationships between circuit components. More specifically, an iterative fixpoint algorithm is presented for finding dominance relationships between multiple-output blocks of the design. These relationships are then leveraged for the early discovery of potential bugs, along with their corrections, resulting in significant debugging speed-ups.

Using an extensive training data set gathered for a wide range of parallel workloads on a commercial multi-core system, we construct multinomial logistic regression (MLR) models that estimate the optimal system settings as a function of workload characteristics.

Cycle efficiency of a HEES system (which is defined as the ratio of energy which is delivered by the HEES system to the load device to energy which is supplied by the power source to the HEES system) is one of the most important factors in determining the overall operational cost of the system. Therefore, EES banks within the HEES system should be prudently designed in order to maximize the overall cycle efficiency. However, the cycle efficiency is not only dependent on the EES element type, but also the dynamic conditions such as charge and discharge rates and energy efficiency of peripheral power circuitries. Also, due to the practical limitations of the power conversion circuitry, the specified capacity of the EES bank cannot be fully utilized, which in turn results in over-provisioning and thus additional capital expenditure for a HEES system with a specified level of service. This is the first paper that presents an EES bank reconfiguration architecture aiming at cycle efficiency and capacity utilization enhancement. We first provide a formal definition of balanced configurations and provide a general reconfigurable architecture for a HEES system, analyze key properties of the balanced reconfiguration, and propose a dynamic reconfiguration algorithm for optimal, online adaptation of the HEES system configuration to the characteristics of the power sources and the load devices as well as internal states of the EES banks. Experimental results demonstrate an overall cycle efficiency improvement of by up to 108% for a DC power demand profile, and pulse duty cycle improvement of by up to 127% for high-current pulsed power profile. We also present analysis results for capacity utilization improvement for- a reconfigurable EES bank.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105395","bank reconfiguration;hybrid electrical energy storage system","","energy conservation;energy storage","DC power demand;HEES system;balanced reconfiguration;energy efficiency;hybrid electrical energy storage system;power conversion efficiency;storage banks","","10","","17","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, the thermo-mechanical stress due to the TSV can also cause reduction in the failure time of wires. However, there is very little study on EM issues that consider TSVs in 3D ICs. In this paper, we show the impact of TSV stress on EM failure time of metal wires in 3D ICs. We model the impact of TSV on stress variation in wires. We then perform detailed modeling of the impact of stress on EM failure time of metal wires. Based on our analysis, we build a detailed library to predict the failure time of a given wire based on current density, temperature and stress. We then propose a method to perform fast full-chip simulation, to determine the various EM related hot-spots in the design.

The problem of minimizing the number of stitches in DPT decomposition is conjectured to be NP-hard. Existing approaches either apply Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or use heuristics. In this paper, we show that the problem is actually in P and present a method to decompose a layout for DPT and minimize the number of stitches optimally.

This is a significant improvement over SSTA that assumes a deterministic power profile, whose mean and SD errors are 3.7% and 20.9% respectively.

However, bufferless routers can provide competitive performance only when network utilization is moderate. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous design that employs both buffered and bufferless routers in the same NoC to achieve high performance at low cost. We evaluate a variety of plans to place buffered and bufferless routers in an NoC based CMP according to performance requirements and power allowances. In order to take full advantage of these heterogeneous NoCs, we also propose novel strategies for buffered-router-aware application thread mapping and a routing algorithm (once the router placement is fixed).

We will review the current state of pMTJ development, along with micromagnetic modeling results for key understanding of STT switching dynamics and latest experimental data of pMTJs. Finally, we discuss the market positioning of the STT-MRAM. While it is currently being targeted for stand-alone commodity memory (replacing DRAM) [4], and embedded memory (replacing embedded Flash, SRAM and DRAM) [6], new market applications such as storage-class solid state drives and embedded solutions in advanced System-on-Chip (SoC) are also being explored.

To handle these diverse constraints, topological floorplan representations are pervasively used because of their higher flexibility and smaller solution space. Due to their intrinsic limitation in deriving module adjacency information directly from the representations themselves, however, they might incur difficulties in handling related constraints. In this paper, we work on B*-trees, which have been shown to be most effective and efficient for floor-plan/placement problems, and present a corner stitching compliant B*-tree (CB-tree, for short) to remedy the significant deficiency in its module adjacency handling. A CB-tree is a B*-tree integrated with modified corner stitching to offer much higher flexibility/efficiency, especially for adjacent module identification/packing. Compared with the previous works, CB-trees can achieve the lowest time complexity for module packing with the aforementioned constraints. Experimental results show that the CB-trees achieve the best solution quality and consume the least running time for industrial designs with various constraints. In particular, our work provides key insights into the handling of comprehensive placement constraints with a topological representation.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105377","","Complexity theory;Layout;Performance evaluation;Routing;Shape;Solids;Tiles","analogue circuits;computational complexity;trees (mathematics)","CB-trees;analog circuit placement;corner stitching compliant B*-tree representation;electrical effects;module packing;time complexity;topological floorplan representations","","0","","26","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike most existing works which usually optimize routability by reallocating whitespace or net-based congestion removal, the proposed algorithm optimizes routability from three major aspects: (1) Pin density: Most existing works optimize routability based on net distribution, while our work considers both the density of pins and their routing directions; (2) Routing overflow optimization: Unlike most previous works that use white space allocation or net-based congestion removal to improve routability, our work optimizes routing overflow by a novel sigmoid function during global placement; (3) Macro porosity consideration: A virtual macro expansion technique is applied to consider the constrained routing resource incurred by big macros. Routability-driven legalization and detailed placement are also proposed to further optimize routing congestion. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

Single-pass simulation allows a designer to find the number of cache misses quickly and accurately on various cache memories. Such single-pass simulation systems have previously relied heavily on cache inclusion properties, which allowed rapid simulation of cache configurations for different applications. Thus far the only inclusion properties discovered were applicable to the Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy based caches. However, LRU based caches are rarely implemented in real life due to their circuit complexity at larger cache associativities. Embedded processors typically use a FIFO replacement policy in their caches instead, for which there are no full inclusion properties to exploit. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a cache property called the “Intersection Property” that helps to reduce single-pass simulation time in a manner similar to inclusion property. An intersection property defines conditions that if met, prove a particular element exists in larger caches, thus avoiding further search time. We have discussed three such intersection properties for caches using the FIFO replacement policy in this paper. A rapid single-pass FIFO cache simulator “CIPARSim” has also been proposed. CIPARSim is the first single-pass simulator dependent on the FIFO cache properties to reduce simulation time significantly. CIPARSim's simulation time was up to 5 times faster (on average 3 times faster) compared to the state of the art single-pass FIFO cache simulator for the cache configurations tested. CIPARSim produces the cache hit and miss rates of an application accurately on various cache configurations. During simulation, CIPARSim's intersection properties alone predict up to 90% (on average 65%) of the total hits, reducing simulat- on time immensely.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105316","","Cache memory;Data models;Magnetic resonance imaging;Predictive models;Proposals;Table lookup","cache storage;circuit complexity;circuit simulation","CIPARSim;FIFO replacement policy;application cache miss rate;cache inclusion properties;cache intersection property;cache memories;circuit complexity;embedded processors;first-in-first-out cache;least recently used replacement policy based caches;single-pass FIFO cache simulation technique;system performance prediction;timing analysis","","4","","32","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minimizing peak power consumption, which is defined as the maximum power consumption among all voltage partitions, is important since it enables energy saving from the voltage island shutdown mechanism. In this paper, we prove that the peak power driven voltage partitioning problem is NP-complete and propose an efficient provably good fully polynomial time approximation scheme for it. The new algorithm can approximate the optimal peak power driven voltage partitioning solution in O(m<sup>2</sup> (mn/ϵ<sup>4</sup>)) time within a factor of (1 + ϵ) for sufficiently small positive e, where n is the number of circuit blocks and m is the number of partitions which is a small constant in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic programming cannot finish for even 20 blocks while our new approximation algorithm runs fast. In particular, varying e, orders of magnitude speedup can be obtained with only 0.6% power increase. The tradeoff between the peak power minimization and the total power minimization is also investigated. We demonstrate that the total power minimization algorithm obtains good results in total power but with quite large peak power, while our peak power optimization algorithm can achieve on average 26.5% reduction in peak power with only 0.46% increase in total power. Moreover, our peak power driven voltage partitioning algorithm is integrated into a simulated annealing based floorplanning technique. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to total power driven floorplanning, the peak power driven floorplanning can significantly reduce peak power with only little impact in total power, HPWL, estimated power ground routing cost, level shifter cost and runtime. Further, when the voltage island shutdown is performed, peak power driven voltage partitioning can lead to over 10% more energy saving than a greed- frequency based voltage partitioning when multiple idle block sequences are considered.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105411","Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme;NP-Complete;Peak Power Minimization;Voltage Island Shutdown;Voltage Partitioning","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Capacitance;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Transforms","approximation theory;computational complexity;logic partitioning;power consumption","HPWL;NP-complete;approximation scheme;circuit miniaturization;maximum power consumption;optimal peak power driven voltage partitioning solution;peak power driven voltage partitioning;peak power minimization;power consumption;power driven based floorplanning technique;voltage island shutdown mechanism;voltage partitioning algorithm","","1","","14","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our results show that, as far as shared on-chip caches are concerned, inter-thread cache line (block) reuse distances are much higher than intra-thread cache line reuse distances. We study the impact of these characteristics on the hit/miss behavior of the shared last-level cache on a commercial multicore machine. We then show that, by rearranging accesses to the objects shared across different threads and to the objects stored in nearby memory locations, inter-thread (temporal and spatial) object reuse distances can be reduced, which in turn helps to reduce inter-thread cache line reuse distances. The results we collected using eight multithreaded applications show that our proposed shared cache-aware code restructuring strategy can reduce misses in the last-level on-chip cache of a commercial multicore machine by 25.4%, on average.

The most critical roadblock in post-silicon validation is the limited observability of internal signals of a design, since this aspect hinders the ability to diagnose detected bugs. A solution to address this issue leverage trace buffers: these are register buffers embedded into the design with the goal of recording the value of a small number of state elements, over a time interval, triggered by a user-specified event. Due to the trace buffer's area overhead, only a very small fraction of signals can be traced. Thus, the selection of which signals to trace is of paramount importance in post-silicon debugging and diagnosis. Ideally, we would like to select signals enabling the maximum amount of reconstruction of internal signal values. Several signal selection algorithms for post-silicon debug have been proposed in the literature: they rely on a probability-based state-restoration capacity metric coupled with a greedy algorithm. In this work we propose a more accurate restoration capacity metric, based on simulation information, and present a novel algorithm that overcomes some key shortcomings of previous solutions. We show that our technique provides up to 34% better state restoration compared to all previous techniques while showing a much better trend with increasing trace buffer size.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105391","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer bugs;Correlation;Estimation;Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Measurement","buffer circuits;electronic engineering computing;greedy algorithms;integrated circuit design;monolithic integrated circuits;program debugging;signal processing","functional bug capture;functional bug elimination;greedy algorithm;integrated circuit design;post-silicon debugging;post-silicon diagnosis;post-silicon validation;pre-silicon verification escape;probability-based state-restoration capacity metric;register buffers;silicon debug;simulation-based signal selection;state restoration;trace buffer size","","11","","15","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For temporal correlation that has great impact on estimating glitches, previous work only showed that it could be considered by means of a glitch-filtering scheme which is an approximation algorithm, but did not answer the question whether temporal correlation could be overcome without any approximation. Our work extends conventional probabilistic simulation techniques and puts the essentials and extensions of probabilistic simulation into a theoretical framework. Based on the framework, this paper shows that modeling temporal correlation in probabilistic simulation without any approximation is only possible in theory.

We introduce Net Level Concurrency (NLC): a novel parallel model for router algorithms that aims to exploit concurrency at the level of individual nets. To efficiently uncover NLC, we design a Scheduler to create groups of nets that can be routed in parallel. At its core, our Scheduler employs a novel algorithm to dynamically analyze data dependencies between multiple nets. We believe such an algorithm can lay the foundation for uncovering data-level parallelism in routing: a necessary requirement for employing high throughput hardware.

In the presence of multiple low-power states, the challenge is to predict the duration of the idle period with high accuracy so that the most beneficial power state can be selected for the idle processor. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic power management scheme for adaptive pipelined MPSoCs, suitable for multimedia applications. We leverage application knowledge in the form of future workload prediction to forecast the duration of idle periods. The predicted duration is then used to select an appropriate power state for the idle processor. We proposed five heuristics as part of the DPM and compared their effectiveness using an MPSoC implementation of the H.264 video encoder supporting HD720p at 30 fps. The results show that one of the application prediction based heuristic (MAMAPBH) predicted the most beneficial power states for idle processors with less than 3% error when compared to an optimal solution. In terms of energy savings, MAMAPBH was always within 1% of the energy savings of the optimal solution. When compared with a naive approach (where only one of the possible power states is used for all the idle processors), MAMAPBH achieved up to 40% more energy savings with only 0.5% degradation in throughput.

We then propose a general integer linear programming formulation for TPL layout decomposition which can simultaneously minimize conflict and stitch numbers. Since ILP has very poor scalability, we propose three acceleration techniques without sacrificing solution quality: independent component computation, layout graph simplification, and bridge computation. For very dense layouts, even with these speedup techniques, ILP formulation may still be too slow. Therefore, we propose a novel vector programming formulation for TPL decomposition, and solve it through effective semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation. Experimental results show that the ILP with acceleration techniques can reduce 82% runtime compared to the baseline ILP. Using SDP based algorithm, the runtime can be further reduced by 42% with some tradeoff in the stitch number (reduced by 7%) and the conflict (9% more).

However, due to the inherent unreliability, defect tolerance schemes are necessary to guarantee the successful implementations of any logic functions. Most of the existing approaches have been based on logic mapping, which exploits the freedom of choosing which variables/products (in a logic function) to map to which of the vertical/horizontal wires (in a crossbar). In this paper, we propose a new defect tolerance approach, namely logic morphing, by exploiting the various equivalent forms of a logic function. This approach explores a new dimension of freedom in achieving defect tolerance, and is compatible with the existing mapping-based approaches. We propose an integrated algorithmic framework, which employs both mapping and morphing simultaneously, and efficiently searches for a successful logic implementation in the combined solution space.

Trees require much smaller capacitance, but meshes are naturally robust against process variation and can accommodate late design changes. Cross-link insertion has been advocated to make trees more robust, but is limited in practice to short distances. In this work we develop a novel non-tree topology that fuses several clock trees to create large-scale redundancy in a clock network. Empirical validation shows that our novel clock-network structure incrementally enhances robustness to satisfy given variation constraints. Our implementation called Contango3.0 produces robust clock networks even for challenging skew limits, without parallel buffering used by other implementations.

In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware re-configurable cache hierarchy (BARCH) with hybrid memory technologies. BARCH consists of a hybrid cache hierarchy, a reconfiguration mechanism, and a statistical prediction engine. Our hybrid cache hierarchy chooses different memory technologies to configure each level so that the bandwidth provided by the overall hierarchy is optimized. Furthermore, we present a reconfiguration mechanism to dynamically adapt the cache space of each level based on the predicted bandwidth demands of different applications, which is guaranteed by our prediction engine.

However, in many programs, even if execution is not 100% numerically correct, the program can still appear to execute correctly from the user's perspective. To quantify user satisfaction, application-level fidelity metrics (such as PSNR) can be used. The output for such applications is defined to be correct if the fidelity metrics satisfy a certain threshold. However, such applications still contain instructions whose outputs are critical - i.e. their correctness decides if the overall quality of the program output is acceptable. In this paper, we present an analysis technique for identifying such critical program segments. More importantly, our technique is capable of guaranteeing application-level correctness through a combination of static analysis and runtime monitoring. Our static analysis consists of data flow analysis followed by control flow analysis to find static critical instructions which affect several instructions. Critical instructions are further refined into likely non-critical and likely critical sets in a profiling phase. At runtime, we use a monitoring scheme to monitor likely non-critical instructions and take remedial actions if some likely non-critical instructions become critical. Based on this analysis, we minimize the number of instructions that are duplicated and checked at runtime using a software-based fault detection and recovery technique [20]. Put together, our approach can lead to 22% average energy savings for multimedia applications while guaranteeing application-level correctness, when compared to a recent work [9], which cannot guarantee application-level correctness. Comparing to the approach proposed in [20] which guarantees both application-level and numerical correctness, our method achieves 79% energy reduction.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105319","","Arrays;Handheld computers;Indexes;Measurement;Monitoring;Runtime;Vectors","data flow analysis;software fault tolerance","application-level correctness assurance;application-level fidelity metrics;control flow analysis;data flow analysis;fault tolerance;program execution;program segment identification;runtime monitoring;soft errors;software-based fault detection;software-based fault recovery technique;static analysis;user satisfaction","","4","1","36","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, by identifying the critical moments in circuit operation and considering the asymmetric aging effects, timing violations under NBTI effect are correctly predicted. The unique features of this work include: (1) delay modeling of a digital gate due to threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) shift using delay dependence on supply voltage from cell library; (2) asymmetric aging analysis is conducted by recognizing the critical points in circuit operation; and (3) setup and hold timing violations due to NBTI induced path delay shift in logic and clock buffer are investigated.

To avoid this tedious job, we propose an automatic approach to infer this assertion. First, we propose a halting algorithm that can decide the existence of the decoder for every particular assertion. Second, for every invalid value of configuration pins that leads to the non-existence of the decoder, we use cofactoring and Craig interpolation to infer a new formula, which covers a larger set of such invalid values. This second step is repeated until all invalid values are covered by these inferred formulas. Finally, we obtain the final assertion by anding the inverses of all these inferred formulas. The decoder exists if and only if this final assertion is still satisfiable. To illustrate its usefulness, we have run our algorithm on several complex encoder circuits, including PCI-E and Ethernet.

Synchronous elasticization converts an ordinary clocked design into LI. It uses communication protocols such as the Synchronous Elastic Flow (SELF). Comparing to its lazy implementations, eager SELF has no combinational cycles and can provide performance advantage. Yet, it uses eager forks (EForks) consuming more area and power. This paper demonstrates that EForks can be redundant. A novel ultra simple fork (USFork) implementation is introduced. The conditions under which an EFork will behave exactly the same as a USFork (from the protocol perspective) are formally derived. The paper also investigates the conditions under which multiple SELF controllers can be merged to further decrease the area and power overhead (as long as the physical placement allows). The flow has been integrated in a fully automated tool, HGEN. Hybrid GENerator (HGEN) selectively replaces redundant EForks with USForks and, optionally, merges equivalent controllers. HGEN uses 6thSense tool as an embedded verification engine. Comparing to the methodology used in published work on a MiniMIPS processor case study, HGEN shows up to 34.3% and 25.4% savings in area and power due to utilizing USForks. It also shows at least 32% saving in the number of EForks in s382 ISCAS benchmark. More reduction is possible if the physical placement allows for controller merging. Thanks to the advance in synchronous verification technology, HGEN runs within a few minutes (for all this paper examples). This makes the proposed approach suitable for tight time-to-market constraints.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105420","","Generators;Integrated circuit modeling;Merging;Protocols;Receivers;Synchronization;Transmitters","controllers;logic design","controller merging;embedded verification engine;hybrid generator;multiple SELF controllers;synchronous elasticization;ultra simple fork","","2","","17","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a combined approach which optimizes loop transformation and memory hierarchy allocation simultaneously to achieve global optimal results on external memory bandwidth and on-chip data reuse buffer size. We develop an efficient and optimal solution to the combined problem by decomposing the solution space into two subspaces with linear and nonlinear constraints respectively. We show that we can significantly prune the solution space without losing its optimality. Experimental results show that our scheme can save up to 31% of on-chip memory size compared to the separated two-step method when the memory hierarchy allocation problem is not trivial. Also, run-time complexity is acceptable for the practical cases.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105324","High-level synthesis;data reuse;loop transformation;memory hierarchy optimization","Arrays;Bandwidth;Memory management;Optimization;Resource management;System-on-a-chip;Vectors","optimisation;storage management","computation-intensive application;data locality;data reuse optimization;external memory access;external memory bandwidth;loop transformation;memory hierarchy allocation;nonlinear constraint;on-chip data reuse buffer size;power consumption","","4","","32","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional data transformation strategies employ linear data layouts, e.g., row-major or column-major, for multidimensional arrays. Although a linear layout matches the linear memory space well in most cases, it can only optimize for self-spatial locality for individual references. In this work, we propose a novel data layout transformation framework that is able to determine a tiled layout for each array in an application program. Tiled layout can exploit the group-spatial locality among different references and improve cache line utilization. In our strategy, the data elements accessed by different references in one loop iteration are placed into a tile and fetched into the same cache line at runtime. This helps minimizing conflict misses in caches. We evaluated our data layout transformation framework using 30 benchmarks on a commercial multicore machine.

Due to the high degree of variety of circuits this task is mainly a manual ad-hoc approach. This paper proposes an automated modeling approach for large scale analog circuits that produces compact expressions from a SPICE netlist. The presented method builds upon the state-of-the-art Trajectory PieceWise (TPW) approach. Because of their data-driven nature, TPW implementations generate models that require on-the-fly database interpolation during simulation, which is not embedded in a standard commercial design flow. Our approach solves this by recombining TPW samples as a surface in a mixed state space-frequency domain, revealing information about the circuit's nonlinear behavior. The resulting data, termed Transfer Function Trajectories (TFT), is fitted with a parametric vector fitting algorithm and further translated to system blocks. These are compatible with VHDL-AMS/Verilog-AMS, Matlab/Simulink or hand calculations at all design stages.

As the first work to address the MDSV global routing problem, power domain-aware routing (PDR) problem is defined and the point-to-point PDR algorithm is also presented herein with look-ahead path selection method and look-up table acceleration approach. For multi-pin net routings, a novel constant-time table-lookup mechanism by invoking four enhanced monotonic routings to fast compute the least-cost monotonic path from every node to the target sub-tree is presented to speed up the query about routing cost (including driven-length slack) to target during multi-source multi-target PDR.

Although existing preconditioned solvers, such as incomplete matrix factor-based preconditioners, usually exhibit high efficiency in memory usage, their convergence behaviors are not always satisfactory. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical support-graph preconditioned iterative algorithm that constructs preconditioners by generating spanning trees in power supply networks for fast power grid analysis. The support-graph preconditioner is efficient for handling complex power grid structures (regular or irregular grids), and can facilitate very fast incremental analysis. Our experimental results on IBM power grid benchmarks show that compared with the best direct or iterative solvers, the proposed support-graph preconditioned iterative solver achieves up to 3.6X speedups for DC analysis, and up to 22X speedups for incremental analysis, while reducing the memory consumption by a factor of four.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105383","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105383","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Convergence;Iterative methods;Linear systems;Power grids;Runtime","iterative methods;power grids;trees (mathematics)","IBM power grid benchmarks;factor-based preconditioners;fast incremental analysis;hierarchical support graphs;iterative solvers;large-scale power delivery networks;power grid analysis;power grid design;power supply networks;preconditioned iterative algorithms;spanning trees;support-graph preconditioner","","13","","18","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, a design undergoes many ECO runs in design houses; the usage of spare cells is of significant importance. Hence, in this paper, we aim at timing ECO using the least number of spare cells. We observe that a path with good timing is desired to be geometrically smooth. Different from negative slack and gate delay used in most of prior work, we propose a new metric of timing criticality - fixability - considering the smoothness of critical paths. To measure the smoothness of a path, we use Bézier curve as the golden path. Furthermore, in order to concurrently fix timing violations, we derive the dominance property to divide violated paths into independent segments. Based on Bézier curve smoothing, fixability identification, and the dominance property, we develop an efficient algorithm to fix violations.

After summarizing the main attack scenarios for security hardware, a selection of countermeasures will be presented. These countermeasures have to be implemented and verified during various phases in the design flow. Some self-made tools and scripts have been used to achieve the result of a highly secure implementation, but there is a huge opportunity to accelerate implementation and verification steps.

A resolution lower than the global routing grid-graph creates regions that are larger in size than the global-cells. The maximum resolution case simplifies the formulation to minimizing the total overflow which has been traditionally used as a metric to evaluate routability. A novel contribution of this work is to demonstrate that for a small analysis time budget, regional minimization of overflow with a lower resolution allows a more accurate identification of the routing congestion hotspot locations, compared to minimizing the total overflow. It allows generating a more accurate congestion heatmap.

Compared with accurate SPICE simulations of random vectors for a set of benchmark circuits, the proposed approach can achieve 13115× speedup while obtains 2.7% more optimization in average.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105382","","Integrated circuit modeling;Logic gates;Noise;Power supplies;RLC circuits;Switches;Vectors","VLSI;delays;integer programming;integrated circuit modelling;linear programming;logic gates;power supply circuits","SPICE simulations;benchmark circuits;digital circuits;intermittent faults;logic gates;mixed-integer linear programming modeling;nano-scale VLSI;power supply noise;random vectors;supply voltage;switching current","","3","","18","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"GPU programming for EDA with OpenCL","Topaloglu, R.O.; Gaster, B.","GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Milpitas, CA, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20111215","2011","","","63","66","Graphical processing unit (GPU) computing has been an interesting area of research in the last few years. While initial adapters of the technology have been from image processing domain due to difficulties in programming the GPUs, research on programming languages made it possible for people without the knowledge of low-level programming languages such as OpenGL develop code on GPUs. Two main GPU architectures from AMD (former ATI) and NVIDIA acquired grounds. AMD adapted Stanford's Brook language and made it into an architecture-agnostic programming model. NVIDIA, on the other hand, brought CUDA framework to a wide audience. While the two languages have their pros and cons, such as Brook not being able to scale as well and CUDA having to account for architectural-level decisions, it has not been possible to compile one code on another architecture or across platforms. Another opportunity came with the introduction of the idea of combining one or more CPUs and GPUs on the same die. Eliminating some of the interconnection bandwidth issues, this combination makes it possible to offload tasks with high parallelism to the GPU. The technological direction towards multicores for CPU-only architectures also require a programming methodology change and act as a catalyst for suitable programming languages. Hence, a unified language that can be used both on multiple core CPUs as well as GPUs and their combinations has gained interest. Open Computing Language (OpenCL), developed originally by the Khronos Group of Apple and supported by both AMD and NVIDIA, is seen as the programming language of choice for parallel programming. In this paper, we provide a motivation for our tutorial talk on usage of OpenCL for GPUs and highlight key features of the language. We provide research directions on OpenCL for EDA. In our tutorial talk, we use EDA as our application domain to get the readers started with programming the rising language of parallelism, OpenCL.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105306","CAD;EDA;GPGPU;GPU;OpenCL;algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Design automation;Graphics processing unit;Kernel;Multicore processing;Programming","graphics processing units;parallel programming;programming languages","AMD;CUDA framework;EDA;GPU architecture;GPU programming;NVIDIA;OpenCL;OpenGL;Stanford Brook language;architectural-level decisions;architecture-agnostic programming model;graphical processing unit computing;image processing domain;low-level programming languages;open computing language;parallel programming;research on programming language;unified language","","1","","17","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Toward efficient spatial variation decomposition via sparse regression","Wangyang Zhang; Balakrishnan, K.; Xin Li; Boning, D.; Rutenbar, R.","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on","20111215","2011","","","162","169","In this paper, we propose a new technique to accurately decompose process variation into two different components: (1) spatially correlated variation, and (2) uncorrelated random variation. Such variation decomposition is important to identify systematic variation patterns at wafer and/or chip level for process modeling, control and diagnosis. We demonstrate that spatially correlated variation carries a unique sparse signature in frequency domain. Based upon this observation, an efficient sparse regression algorithm is applied to accurately separate spatially correlated variation from uncorrelated random variation. An important contribution of this paper is to develop a fast numerical algorithm that reduces the computational time of sparse regression by several orders of magnitude over the traditional implementation. Our experimental results based on silicon measurement data demonstrate that the proposed sparse regression technique can capture spatially correlated variation patterns with high accuracy. The estimation error is reduced by more than 3.5× compared to other traditional methods.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105321","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational efficiency;Discrete cosine transforms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Semiconductor device measurement;Systematics;Vectors","CMOS integrated circuits;computational complexity;electronic engineering computing;regression analysis;semiconductor industry","computational time;process variation;sparse regression;spatial variation decomposition;systematic variation patterns;unique sparse signature","","5","","19","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As one promising candidate, spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) features fast access time, high density, non-volatility, and good CMOS process compatibility. However, like all other nano-scale devices, the performance and reliability of STT-RAM cells are severely affected by process variations, intrinsic device operating uncertainties and environmental fluctuations. In this work, we systematically analyze the impacts of CMOS and MTJ process variations, MTJ switching uncertainties induced by thermal fluctuations and working temperature on the performance and reliability of STT-RAM cells. A combined circuit and magnetic simulation platform is also established to quantitatively analyze the persistent and non-persistent error rates during the STT-RAM cell operations. Finally, an optimization flow and its effectiveness are depicted by using some STT-RAM cell designs as case study.","1092-3152","978-1-4577-1399-6","978-1-4577-1398-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6105370","Spin-transfer torque (STT);magnetic RAM;non-persistent error;persistent error;process variation","Fluctuations;MOSFETs;Magnetic tunneling;Random access memory;Resistance;Switches","CMOS digital integrated circuits;electronics industry;integrated circuit design;random-access storage;statistical analysis","CMOS process compatibility;MTJ process variations;STT-RAM cell design optimization;circuit simulation platform;electronic industry;environmental fluctuations;intrinsic device operating uncertainties;magnetic simulation platform;nanoscale devices;next generation memory technology;nonpersistent error rate reduction;optimization flow;persistent error rate reduction;spin-transfer torque random access memory;statistical design view;switching uncertainties;technical scaling;thermal fluctuations;working temperature","","13","","17","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
