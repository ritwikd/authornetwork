"Digital microfluidic biochips: Functional diversity, More than Moore, and cyberphysical systems","Chakrabarty, K.; Pop, P.; Tsung-Yi Ho","Duke Univ., Durham, NC, USA","Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS), 2011 Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on","20111027","2011","","","377","377","Summary form only given. The 2010 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that bio-medical chips will soon revolutionize the healthcare market. These bio-medical chips should be able to sense and actuate, store and manipulate data, and transmit information. To realize such bio-medical chips, the integration of embedded systems and microfluidics inevitably leads to a new research dimension for More than Moore and beyond. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the emerging technology of digital microfluidics, which is poised to play a key role in the transformation of healthcare and the interplay between biochemistry and embedded systems. Advances in droplet-based “digital” microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochip devices for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter-volume droplets of biochemical samples and reagents. Therefore, integrated circuit (IC) technology can be used to transport and transport “chemical payload” in the form of micro/nanofluidic droplets. As a result, non-traditional biomedical applications and markets (e.g., high-throughout DNA sequencing, portable and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, protein crystallization for drug discovery), and fundamentally new uses are opening up for ICs and systems. However, continued growth (and larger revenues resulting from technology adoption by pharmaceutical and healthcare companies) depends on advances in chip integration and design-automation tools. In particular, design-automation tools are needed to ensure that biochips are as versatile as the macro-labs that they are intended to replace. This is therefore an opportune time for the semiconductor industry and circuit/system designers to make an impact in this emerging field. This tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor ICs/systems industry with the biomedical and pharmaceu- - tical industries. The audience will see how a “biochip compiler” can translate protocol descriptions provided by an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the underlying digital microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. Sensor integration and close coupling between the underlying hardware and the control software in a cyberphysical framework will also be described. A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Commercial devices and advanced prototypes from the major company in this market segment (Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc.) will be described, and ongoing activity on newborn screening using digital microfluidic biochips at several large hospitals in Illinois will be highlighted. The topics covered in the tutorial include the following: 1) Technology and application drivers: Motivation and background, actuation methods, electrowetting and digital microfluidics, review of micro-fabrication processes, applications to biochemistry, medicine, and laboratory procedures. 2) System-level design automation: Synthesis techniques: scheduling of fluidic operations, resource binding (mapping of operations to on-chip resources), module placement. 3) Physical-level design automation: droplet routing, defect tolerance, chip-level design, and design of pin-constrained biochips. 4) Testing and design-for-testability: Defects, fault modeling, test planning, reconfiguration techniques, sensor integration and cyberphysical system design.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062311","Microfluidics;biochips;design automation;system-on-chip","Biochemistry;Educational institutions;Integrated circuits;Laboratories;Medical services;Microfluidics;Tutorials","bioMEMS;biochemistry;drops;embedded systems;health care;lab-on-a-chip;microfabrication;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;monolithic integrated circuits;nanofluidics","actuation methods;biochemical reagents;biochemical samples;biochemistry;biochip compiler;biochip devices;biomedical chips;chemical payload;chip integration;chip level design;control software;cyberphysical framework;cyberphysical systems;defect tolerance;design automation tools;digital microfluidic biochips;droplet based digital microfluidics;droplet routing;electrowetting;embedded systems;executable fluidic instructions;functional diversity;health care;integrated circuit technology;laboratory procedure automation;microfabrication processes;microfluidic droplets;molecular biology;nanofluidic droplets;nanoliter volume droplet control;optimized fluidic instructions;pin constrained biochip design;semiconductor IC;sensor integration;synthesis techniques;system level design automation","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional technology scaling of semiconductor chips followed Moore's Law. However, the transistor performance improvement will be limited, and designer will not see doubling of frequency every two years. Recently, three-dimension integrated circuits (3D IC) that employ the vertically through-silicon vias (TSVs) for connecting each of dies have been proposed. It is an alternative solution to existent Package-on-Package (PoP) and System-in-Package (SiP) processes. There are many benefits by using TSV-based 3-D integration technologies: (1) more functionality can be integrated into a small silicon space for form factor reduction, (2) circuit delay can be improved by using TSVs due to the shorter interconnect and reduced parasitic capacitance/inductance, (3) different components with incompatible manufacturing process (i.e. Logic, DRAM, Flash, etc) can be combined in single 3-D IC for heterogeneous integration. In addition, there are many 3-D multi-core or many-core architectures are discussed recently. Comparing with traditional two-dimension multi-core or many-core architectures, the major difference is memory bandwidth problem can be addressed by stacked memory architecture. Intel has good demonstration through the teraflops microprocessor chip which is an 80-core design with memory-on-logic architecture. And, each core connects to a 256KB SRAM with 12GB/s bandwidth. Although 3-D stacking technology can bring us many benefits for next generation integrated circuits, it comes with many problems and challenges in system-level design. For instance, 3-D IC designs will deal with serious challenges in design space exploration and system validation. For most designs, the number of TSV will be the most critical limitation that should be considered carefully. Besides, system design by 3-D IC will become more and more complex, and it needs a full system-level solution to face the performance, number of TSV, and power issues of 3D-IC. Furthermore, i- - t is more challenge to provide a FPGA-based prototyping system for early-stage software development. In general, the continue increasing complexity of modern SoC or embedded system design is also extreme. To achieve the required design productivity for the time-to-market pressure, a common accepted solution is using electronic system-level (ESL) design methodology to design the system in the different design abstraction level. One of the key technologies of ESL solution is to construct the HW/SW co-simulation platform by using the virtual prototyping concept. Moreover, designers need a multiphase of virtual platform construction to meet the different targets of design stage, such as early system validation and architecture exploration. In this work, we create a simulation framework by using ESL methodology to explore 3-D IC system that consists of multi-core processors with extended stacking memory. To demonstrate our 3-D IC design techniques, the stacking memory approach is employed in our “3D-PAC (Parallel Architecture Core)” design. In 3D-PAC, we stack SRAM directly on top of the logic die which is heterogeneous multi-core computing platform for multimedia application purpose. The logic die is mainly consists of a general-purpose microprocessor, dual programmable digital signal processor (DSP) cores, AXI/AHB/APB subsystems, and various peripherals. Furthermore, we had the corresponding virtual platform (PAC Duo virtual platform) which had been used for early architecture exploration, power estimation and HW/SW co-simulation. The difference with PAC Duo design, the target of 3D-PAC is to provide a three-dimensional SoC (3-D SoC) design exporation for media-rich and multi-function portable devices. Although using the stacking memory approach with TSV technology can increase the capacity and performance of memory system significantly, but the placement and organization of the memory system are the nother important design issues.

By incorporating knowledge about the temporal behavior of such multi-mode systems, it is possible to share hardware by means of partial reconfiguration, and thus, reduce costs and improve performance. In this paper, we specify the temporal behavior of the functionality by applying known models based on state machines. In addition, we introduce an architectural model that allows to express the characteristics of nowadays partially reconfigurable architectures, focusing on FPGAs. We develop a symbolic encoding of this novel system specification, which allows to perform a unified system synthesis for allocation, binding, placement of partially reconfigurable modules, and routing the on-chip communication. The proposed encoding enables the use of sophisticated optimization techniques, coupling a SAT solver with a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed methodology is highly applicable for building multi-mode systems on advanced reconfigurable technology. We demonstrate this by experiments on test-cases from the image processing domain applying state-of-the-art technology. The results show the superiority of the presented approach in terms of run-time and quality of the found solutions compared to existing system synthesis approaches.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062281","","Computer architecture;Hardware;Resource management;Routing;Switching circuits;System-on-a-chip;Tiles","encoding;evolutionary computation;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;optimisation;reconfigurable architectures;symbol manipulation","FPGA;SAT solver;image processing domain;multimode reconfigurable system;multobjective evolutionary algorithm;on-chip communication;operational mode;optimization technique;partially reconfigurable architecture;state machine based model;symbolic design space exploration;symbolic encoding;temporal behavior;unified system synthesis","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the choice of suitable platform parameters such as task and message schedules becomes a challenging design problem as the protocol is complex in nature and enforces a tight coupling between local task schedules on ECUs and global bus schedules. Although there exist several commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) design tools for FlexRay and control systems, current tools do not provide any mechanism for automatically synthesizing the platform parameters from the controller specifications. In this work we synthesize controllers subject to specified control goals while taking into account platform-specific properties. In particular, we translate the timing constraints derived from the control design into platform constraints that need to be satisfied by the control-related tasks and messages. For this purpose, we formulate and solve a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to synthesize feasible platform parameters that can be realized by the underlying operating systems and the FlexRay bus. Our design flow may be easily integrated with existing FlexRay design tools and will significantly ease (and automate) the existing design process. We show the applicability of our results by implementing two automotive control systems on a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) setup and study how different bus configurations affect the controller synthesis and the choice of platform parameters.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062282","Automotive Control Systems;Cyber-Physical Systems;FlexRay;Operating Systems;Schedule Synthesis","Automotive engineering;Control systems;Delay;Dynamic scheduling;Protocols;Schedules;Silicon","automobiles;constraint theory","FlexRay-based automotive control systems;bus configuration;bus protocols;commercial off-the-shelf design tools;constraint satisfaction problem;constraint-driven synthesis;controller specifications;deterministic temporal behavior;hardware-in-the-loop;tool-support","","1","","22","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of existing fault-and process-models are adopted and a Binary Tree Analysis (BTA) is proposed to compute the system-level reliability in the presence of software/hardware redundancy. The BTA is integrated into a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm via a two-step encoding to perform reliability-aware design optimization. The optimization results contain the mapping of tasks to processing elements, the exact task and message schedule and the fault-tolerance policy assignment. Based on the observation that permanent faults need to be considered together with transient faults to achieve optimal system design, we propose a virtual mapping technique to take both types of faults into account. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in fault-tolerant task scheduling that considers permanent and transient faults in a unified manner. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated using several case studies.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062296","Design Optimization;Embedded Systems;Reliability","Complexity theory;Fault tolerant systems;Redundancy;Schedules;Transient analysis","embedded systems;fault tolerance;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","binary tree analysis;fault-tolerance policy assignment;fault-tolerant task scheduling;hardware replication;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiprocessor embedded system;reliability-aware design optimization;safety-related system;software reexecution;software/hardware redundancy;system-level reliability;two-step encoding;virtual mapping","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optimizing these network and system metrics require understanding of silicon photonics device characteristics. However, existing design space exploration methodologies rely on time-consuming electromagnetic simulations or measurement of fabricated devices. In this paper, we introduce analytical models of devices, explore their design spaces, and apply them to different applications. The analytical models consist of parametrized transfer-matrices, with parameters categorized as fabrication-induced parameters and design parameters. Fabrication-induced parameters can be calibrated against measurements of fabricated devices to achieve high accuracy, whereas design parameters help in extrapolating the device characteristics. We develop and calibrate analytical models of widely used passive and doped micro-ring resonators.

In this paper, we therefore present a novel resource-management scheme that supports so-called malleable applications. These applications can adopt their level of parallelism to the assigned resources. By design, our (decentralized) scheme is scalable and it copes with the computational complexity by focusing on local decision-making. Our simulations show that the quality of the mapping decisions of our approach is able to stay near the mapping quality of state-of-the-art (i.e. centralized) online schemes for malleable applications but at a reduced overall communication overhead (only about 12,75% on a 1024 core system with a total workload of 32 multi-threaded applications).

In this paper, we show that this strategy might not always be more energy efficient than the traditional DVS strategy and there exits a tradeoff between these two strategies depending on the job work-demand to be finished within certain interval. To effectively address this issue, we propose a technique that combines these two strategies to achieve better energy saving performance.

We introduce the notion of virtual scratchpad memories (vSPMs), which can be dynamically created and managed as regular SPMs. To protect the on-chip memory space, the SP-MVisor supports vSPM-level and block-level access control lists. In order to efficiently manage the on-chip real-estate, our SPMVisor supports policy-driven allocation strategies based on privilege levels.

We propose a mathematical framework that precisely estimates that minimal playout delay value. Perhaps more importantly, unlike existing analytical models, our framework allows to specify loss and provides guarantees that the desired display quality is achieved with the chosen delay.

It is imperative that peak temperatures are reduced and that heat is spread as evenly on the chip as possible to avoid mutual heating and high thermal gradients between processor cores. Approaches have emerged which share a global power budget among multiple cores in order to meet these objectives. However, while these approaches act proactively in distributing power across the chip before thermal problems arise, changes in the respective strategies remain reactive to a temperature threshold. Our approach uses reinforcement learning in order to dynamically change what we call power trading strategies before thermal thresholds are hit based on past recorded observations. Through learning, our hierarchical approach is also able to distribute so-called multiple power budgets at once thereby making power trading more effective, reaching a decrease in peak temperatures of around 4% compared to a fully distributed approach - which can be critical at near-threshold temperatures in terms of transient errors - while also decreasing the number of deadline misses by a factor of 7. Our technique has been verified by deploying a thermal camera.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062288","Agent-Based Systems;Dynamic Thermal Management;MPSoCs;Multi-Core Architectures;Proactive Algorithm","Computer architecture;Economics;Heating;Monitoring;Power demand;Temperature measurement;Thermal management","CMOS integrated circuits;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","economic learning;many-core architecture;multicore processor;nanoCMOS era;power trading strategy;reinforcement learning;thermal camera;thermal threshold;thermal-aware power budgeting","","0","","18","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, VMs are rewarding in the context of mixed-criticality applications to provide isolation between critical and non-critical tasks running on the same processor. In this paper, we study the design of a real-time system based on a VM monitor/hypervisor that supports multiple VMs/domains. Since each VM in the system runs several real-time tasks, scheduling the VMs leads to a hierarchical scheduling problem. So far, most published techniques for analyzing hierarchical scheduling deal with the schedulabil-ity problem, i.e., for a given hierarchical scheduler, testing whether a set of real-time tasks meet their deadlines. In this paper, we are rather concerned with the synthesis of hier-archical/VM schedulers; that is, how to design a scheduler such that all real-time tasks running on the different VMs meet their deadlines. We consider a setup where the tasks are scheduled on multiple VMs under fixed priorities according to the Deadline Monotonic (DM) policy. The VMs are scheduled under fixed priorities on a Rate Monotonic (RM) basis using one or more processors. A partitioned scheduling of VMs is considered, i.e., VMs are not allowed to migrate from one processor to the other. In this context, we propose a method for selecting optimum time slices and periods for each VM in the system. Our goal is to configure the VM scheduler such that not only all tasks are schedulable but also the minimum possible resources are used. Finally, to illustrate the proposed design technique, we present a case study based on automotive control applications.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062302","Embedded Software;Real-Time Scheduling;Virtual Machines","Delta modulation;Monitoring;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Real time systems;Scheduling;Time factors","automotive engineering;control engineering computing;embedded systems;processor scheduling;program testing;virtual machines","VM monitor;VM scheduler design;automotive control applications;critical tasks;deadline monotonic policy;embedded real-time application;hierarchical scheduling problem;mixed-criticality application;multiple VM;noncritical tasks;partitioned scheduling;platform-independent software development;rate monotonic basis;schedulability problem;virtual machines","","0","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normally, an embedded system is designed for a specific application or a domain of applications. Performing simulations on the application(s) is the most popular way to find the optimal L1 cache configuration. However, the simulation-based approach suffers from long simulation time due to the need to exhaustively simulate all configurations, which are characterized by three parameters: the number of cache sets, associativity, and the cache line size. In previous work, the most time-consuming part was to determine the hit or miss status of a cache access under each configuration by performing a linear search on a long linked-list based on the inclusion property. In this work, we propose a novel simulator, HC-Sim, which adopts elaborate data structures, a centralized hash table, and a novel miss counter structure, to effectively reduce the search time. On average, we can achieve 2.56X speedup compared to the existing fastest approach (SuSeSim). In addition, we implement HC-Sim by using the dynamic binary instrumentation tool, Pin. This provides scalability for simulating larger applications by eliminating the overhead of generating and storing a huge trace file. Furthermore, HC-Sim provides the capacity to simulate an L1 cache and a scratchpad memory (SPM) simultaneously. It helps designers to explore the design space considering both L1 cache configurations and the SPM sizes.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062301","Cache simulation;Dynamic binary instrumentation;L1 cache;LRU;Miss rate;Scratchpad memory;Simulation","Binary trees;Complexity theory;Energy consumption;Indexes;Radiation detectors;Vegetation","cache storage;data structures;embedded systems;performance evaluation;power aware computing","HC-Sim;L1 cache simulator;Pin;SPM sizes;centralized hash table;data structures;dynamic binary instrumentation tool;embedded system;energy consumption;file storage;miss counter structure;scalability;scratchpad memory cosimulation support","","1","","29","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, memory controller design has so far largely focused on improving average-case performance. As a consequence, the latency of memory accesses is unpredictable, which complicates the worst-case execution time analysis necessary for hard real-time embedded systems. Our work introduces a novel DRAM controller design that is predictable and that significantly reduces worst-case access latencies. Instead of viewing the DRAM device as one resource that can only be shared as a whole, our approach views it as multiple resources that can be shared between one or more clients individually. We partition the physical address space following the internal structure of the DRAM device, i.e., its ranks and banks, and interleave accesses to the blocks of this partition. This eliminates contention for shared resources within the device, making accesses temporally predictable and temporally isolated. This paper describes our DRAM controller design and its integration with a precision-timed (PRET) architecture called PTARM. We present analytical bounds on the latency and throughput of the proposed controller, and confirm these via simulation.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062323","memory controller;memory hierarchy;real-time computing;temporal isolation;timing predictability","Arrays;Bandwidth;Capacitors;Instruction sets;Memory management;Random access memory;Timing","DRAM chips;embedded systems;logic design","DRAM controller design;PRET DRAM controller;bank privatization;dynamic random access memory;hard realtime embedded system;memory controller design;precision-timed architecture;temporal isolation;worst-case execution time analysis","","13","","17","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While integration eases design by allowing modularization and component reuse, it is still done in a mostly ad hoc manner. Designers work with descriptions of components that are either informal or incomplete (e.g., documents in English, structural but non-behavioral specifications in IP-XACT) or too low-level (e.g., HDL code), and have little to no automatic support for stitching the components together. Providing such support is the glue design problem. This paper addresses this problem using a model-based approach. The key idea is to use high-level models, such as dataflow graphs, that enable efficient automated analysis. The analysis can be used to derive performance properties of the system (e.g., component compatibility, throughput, etc.), optimize resource usage (e.g., buffer sizes), and even synthesize low-level code (e.g., control logic). However, these models are only abstractions of the real system, and often omit critical information. As a result, the analysis outcomes may be defensive (e.g., buffers that are too big) or even incorrect (e.g., buffers that are too small).

While previous works have attempted to target different aspects of the MPMC design challenges, none has succeeded in addressing all these problems simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can provide, not only minimum latency and bandwidth guarantees, but also higher efficiency in utilization of physical DRAM bandwidth and dynamic bandwidth made available by underutilized ports. Experimental results showthat, on typical multimedia workloads, our approach improves the effective DRAM bandwidth and energy efficiency by as much as 1.9× and 1.49×, respectively. In addition, the response latency for latency-sensitive port is improved by more than 10X, while preserving bandwidth guarantee for all ports.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062293","Bandwidth;DRAM;Energy;Latency;MPMC;QoS","Bandwidth;Dynamic scheduling;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Quality of service;Random access memory","DRAM chips;embedded systems;energy conservation;multimedia systems;system-on-chip","bandwidth guarantee;dynamic bandwidth;embedded multimedia system-on-chip;energy efficiency;higher memory system performance;latency-sensitive port;minimum latency;multiport memory controller;physical DRAM bandwidth;quality-of-service guarantee","","0","","19","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, this relation is crucial if a compiler-optimized program must be debugged or results from a low-level analysis need to be mapped to the source code to perform manual optimizations. Existing approaches for the debugging of optimized code usually require pervasive changes in the compiler and hence are not available for all architectures. Methods for analyzing non-functional properties of software components in complex systems (i.e. execution time and power consumption) often have similar constraints, if compiler optimizations are supported at all. This paper proposes two novel concepts to overcome these issues. To precisely relate source-level statements with the respective compiler-generated machine code, a method to reconstruct and disambiguate debug information is presented. Based on this information, an instrumentation technique is introduced which allows accurately simulating the execution of optimized binary code at the source code level. Experimental results show that by using this technique, arbitrary low-level properties of software components can be evaluated in a fast and accurate manner without running the software on the actual target hardware.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062303","","Binary codes;Computer architecture;Debugging;Optimization;Program processors;Timing","digital simulation;embedded systems;optimising compilers;software engineering","compiler-generated machine code;dominator homomorphism based code matching;embedded software;instrumentation technique;optimized code debugging;optimizing compiler;software component;source-level simulation","","1","","25","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As extensible processors have become more popular, several algorithms have been proposed for automatically identifying instruction-set extensions in order to reduce the effort of manual design and verification. However, most of them focus on finding large and complex instructions that are used only once, rather than repeatedly used ones. Moreover, some other approaches that consider recurrence are limited to finding small instructions. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that considers the instruction reusability as well as I/O serialization. In order to overcome high complexity of the problem, we develop a canonical form construction algorithm for fast isomorphism detection on directed acyclic graphs and an incremental template generation algorithm that identifies the best custom instruction with a user-defined fitness function. Moreover, our algorithm serializes I/O operations so that the numbers of inputs and outputs of custom instructions are not limited by the microarchitecture. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves significant improvement over previous approaches in terms of algorithm runtime as well as performance gain obtained by the custom instructions.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062307","ASIPs;I/O serialization;extensible processors;instruction-set extension;isomorphism detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Microarchitecture;Partitioning algorithms;Program processors;Registers","directed graphs;instruction sets;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","I/O serialization;canonical form construction algorithm;directed acyclic graph;extensible processor;incremental template generation algorithm;instruction reusability;instruction-set extension;isomorphism detection;isomorphism-aware custom instruction identification;low power consumption;performance improvement;user-defined fitness function","","1","","22","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A popular example is the Synergistic Processing Unit (SPU) in the IBM Cell processor. To be able to minimize the branch penalty using branch hint instructions, in addition to estimating the branch probabilities (which has been looked at before [6, 25, 24]), it is important to carefully insert branch hints. Towards this, in this paper, we i) construct a branch penalty model for compiler, ii) formulate the problem of minimizing branch penalty using branch hinting and iii) propose a heuristic to solve this problem. The heuristic is based on three basic techniques that we introduce in this paper: NOP padding, hint pipelining, and nested loop restructuring. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our solution can reduce the branch penalty as much as 35.4% over the previous approach.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062308","Branch hint;Cell processor;Compiler optimization","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Hardware;Microprocessors;Pipeline processing;Pipelines;Software","multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;program compilers","IBM cell SPU;IBM cell processor;NOP padding;branch hint instructions;branch penalty model;branch penalty reduction;branch probability;compiler;hardware branch prediction;hint pipelining;nested loop restructuring;processor design;software branch hinting;synergistic processing unit","","0","","25","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these mobile processors are also expected to be compact, ultra-portable, and provide an always-on, continuous data access paradigm necessitating a low-power design. As mobile processors increasingly begin to leverage multi-core functionality, the power consumption incurred from maintaining coherence between local caches due to bus snooping becomes more prevalent. This paper explores a novel approach to mitigating multi-core processor power consumption in mobile smartphones. By using dynamic application memory behavior, one can intelligently target adjustments in the cache coherency protocol to help reduce the overhead of maintaining consistency when the benefits of multi-core shared cache coherence are muted. On the other hand, by utilizing a fine-grained approach, the proposed architecture can still respond to and enable the benefits of hardware cache coherence in situations where the performance improvements greatly outweigh the associated energy costs. The simulation results show appreciable reductions in overall cache power consumption, with negligible impact to overall execution time.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062322","cache coherence;dynamic;low-power;mobile processors;multi-core;power-sensitive","Coherence;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Power demand;Program processors;Protocols;Smart phones","cache storage;computer power supplies;memory architecture;microprocessor chips;mobile computing;multiprocessing systems","bus snooping;continuous data access paradigm;dynamic application memory behavior;dynamic multicore cache coherence architecture;general-purpose processors;local caches;low-power design;mobile smartphones;multicore functionality;multicore processor power consumption mitigation;multicore shared cache coherence;power-sensitive mobile processors","","0","","15","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The “digital” microfluidic biochips (DM-FBs) are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic mi-crofluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools are being developed for DMFBs. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis and chip-level design to testing. Design automations are expected to alleviate the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062306","Microfluidics;biochips;design automation","Arrays;Design automation;Electrodes;Mixers;Pins;Routing;Wires","bioMEMS;biochemistry;computer aided analysis;electrodes;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics","automated synthesis;bioassays;biochemical analysis;biochemical analyzers;chip optimization;chip-level design;computer-aided-design tools;continuous flow;design complexity;digital microfluidic biochips;dilution;discrete droplets;electrodes;fluidic-level synthesis;integrate on-chip;manual optimization;microelectronics;mixing;nanoscale bioassays;time-consuming chip designs;two-dimensional array","","0","","50","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work introduces a novel low-footprint model based on adaptive discretization grids to deal with the complex geometry of 3D ICs. Additionally, we use the operator splitting method to compute the transient temperature with linear time in the number of grid cells.

Voltage scaling has been widely used to address the increases in power consumption in submicron regimes. However, with the advent of process variation in the configuration SRAMs, voltage scaling can undermine the integrity of a design implemented on the FPGA device as the design's functionality is determined by the contents of the configuration SRAMs. In this paper, we propose to exploit the abundance of homogenous resources on FPGA, in order to realize voltage scaling in the presence of process variation. Depending on the design to be implemented on FPGA, we select the minimal voltage that sustains a reliable placement. We then introduce a novel 2-phase placement algorithm that maximizes the reliability of the implemented design when voltage scaling is applied to the configuration memory. In the first phase, pre-deployment placement, we maximize the reliability of the implemented designs considering the a priori distribution of SRAM failures due to process variation and voltage scaling. The second phase, post-deployment placement, is performed once the device is fabricated in order to determine a fault-free placement of the design for the FPGA device. Our results indicate significant leakage power reduction (more than 50%) in the configuration memory when our placement technique is combined with voltage scaling with little delay degradation.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062297","Computer Aided Design;FPGA;Placement;Process Variation;Voltage Scaling","Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Power demand;Random access memory;Reliability engineering;Threshold voltage","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability","2-phase placement algorithm;SRAM-based FPGA;configuration memory;design functionality;fault-free placement;homogenous resources;post-deployment placement;power consumption;predeployment placement;process variations;reliability-aware placement;submicron regimes;voltage scaling realization","","2","","23","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
